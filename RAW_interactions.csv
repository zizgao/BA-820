2001676733,531712,2017/8/18,5,This is my third time making this recipe. It's yummy!
1803266070,507226,2014/10/25,5,Love it !   Will make this again.
2000496795,507226,2015/9/25,0,"This is the best butternut squash recipe ever, but it is even better by adding a teaspoon of allspice at the same time the half and half is added. Will make again soon!"
2001028411,507226,2016/5/28,5,So easy and never fails!! I add a little more stock and I have used just pumpkin before - equally as good!
136997,523426,2016/7/17,5,My husband says this is a keeper. Easy to prepare and took less than an hour.
369715,507198,2013/10/15,3,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I used beef broth instead of water. This was a meaty and beany chili that but it  was missing something for us.
2000539634,512986,2015/10/9,1,"The standing ovation was for an ice cream I made while working at square one. This is not my original recipe, however. I always called it tootsie roll ice cream. I don&#039;t know why Joyce refers to this as hers.  The only difference in her recipe and mine was that I used half cream and half whole milk and bittersweet chocolate not semi-sweet. The standing ovation was not for this recipe."
265954,523223,2015/10/9,3,"This is a good starter recipe. I made as directed and thought it was missing something, maybe some diced onion and celery for crunch. With the barbecue sauce, this dish did not need the additional brown sugar, which made this a little too sweet for us. On the plus side, this is a quick and easy recipe to throw together when pressed for time."
2000462154,523223,2016/9/12,5,Quick and easy recipe. Absolutely love it.
226863,495322,2013/3/1,4,"This recipe makes a lot of sauce to go with the meat.  I really wanted mashed potatoes so served this over mashed potatoes instead of over the rice.  This turned out a bit sweet, so I think I'd half the amount of Pepsi and ketchup next time.  I'll also simmer a bit longer to allow the meat to get a bit more tender.  Overall, this tasted very good.  Thanks for posting, and good luck in the contest!"
131126,495322,2013/3/2,5,"I adapted the recipe to fit my day. The steak was breaded and fried early in the day and then set aside. Later that evening, the steak was placed in a foil lined pan sauce,  veggies were added, and the recipe baked uncovered for 50 minutes on 350 oven.  We found the steak was still fairly tough and it would have benefited for a longer cook time.  There was still loads of sauce and the recipe had enough onions and peppers.  The sauce thickened, has notes of celery seed, and a nice hint of tart from the ponzu. The meal was served with mixed colors of fingerling potatoes, garlic bread, and a green salad.  I wish I had followed the instructions though & stuck with the suggested rice.  I saved the leftover sauce to serve over potatoes later in the week.  <br/>Next time? I would use tenderized round for frying & increase the baking time.  Good luck in the contest!"
128473,502734,2013/7/15,5,"I really enjoyed the eggs prepared this way morgainegeiser.  It was quick and really easy with fantastic results.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and had a wonderful texture and flavor.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, it made for a delicious breakfast.  Made for ZWT9."
328048,502734,2013/7/17,0,Easy and delicious. I cooked my eggs 20 minutes to get them cooked through. Great flavor. The feta adds a nice touch.
1226388,502734,2013/7/18,5,"This was really great!  It was delicious, and fast and easy enough to be a quick weekday breakfast, and luxurious enough for a lazy weekend.  It was really tasty just as it was posted, and I would like to try it next time with some additions like sauteed veggies, or even some bacon.  Made for ZWT9"
133174,502734,2013/7/19,5,Made this for DH&#039;s breakfast this morning.  The butter was placed in the ramekin which was put into the oven while it preheated.  After butter melted the eggs were broken and placed into the ramekin then sprinkled with the feta.  Freshly ground black pepper was sprinkled over all.  The eggs required about an additional 4 minutes to cook to DH&#039;s liking.  This was served with butter toast.  Made for ZWT9.
383346,502734,2013/7/23,5,I baked them 12 minutes.  The white were cooked but the yolks were still runny.  It was great.  Thanks morgainegeiser :)  Made for ZWT 9
174096,502734,2013/7/27,5,"Yum, love this variation - the feta cheese really added a lot of great flavor.  I cooked about 12 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
286566,502734,2013/8/12,5,"Delicious though I did have an oops moment in that the timer did not go off so my eggs ended up cooked more than I would have liked but still the flavours were great.  Thank you morgaingeiser, made for Aussie/Kiwi Recipe Swap #79 August 2013."
480195,502734,2013/8/27,5,"This is a delicious way to serve eggs. My oven must run hot, because they were done in 10 minutes. I served them with sliced tomatoes, fresh from the garden. A wonderful breakfast. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
128473,511790,2014/5/2,4,"This was an interesting dish.  My dh &amp; I have never tried anything like this before.  It was a pleasant surprise. Quick and easy to make with a nice flavor.  I added a lot of hot pepper sauce to the beans, we like it hot.  We did prefer the beans the following day, the flavor of the sauce had permeated the meat more.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
2876642,512630,2014/11/17,5,Really simple and delicious!  I use this recipe whenever I don&#039;t feel like doing much work for vegetables -and it&#039;s still very yummy!
2177426,512630,2018/2/3,5,"So simple and so good! I used pink salt, just because....LOL. The temp. and timing are perfect. Thank you Martha"
2708004,514512,2014/3/21,5,EVERYONE loved this salad!  It was so easy and so different.  I will definitely be making this again (and again!).
163112,493845,2013/9/14,5,"Ooh quick, easy &amp; utterly delicious!  I used a cast iron skillet to &#039;grill&#039; the figs.  I cut this down to 2 servings but added an extra fig.  ;)  Very nice serving size.  I left out the water &amp; used a splash extra orange blossom water instead.  It came through nicely but wasn&#039;t overpowering.  I basted the figs, lol, but in the end wished I hadn&#039;t.  When the figs were removed, I added the rest of the syrup to heat for just a moment before pouring it over the sundaes.  I wished I&#039;d had more syrup but I&#039;d used it basting.  DD &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed this treat &amp; I even got a pic for ya!  Made forrrr....Autumn NA/ME Tag  9/13.  :)  Thanks, A!"
47892,493845,2013/12/18,5,I tossed everything in the blender and blended for a full 2 minutes. *Yum*! My changes were I used dried figs (barhi figs) and I didn&#039;t grill them and added a small pinch of cardamom. Made for NA*ME tag Dec-Feb 2014.
1802656792,496008,2014/4/10,1,"Oh my goodness this was just plain awful. Even after 3 hours cooking, the rice is still hard and the tofu is chunky. &lt;br/&gt;Trying to save it by letting it cook longer. There HAS to be a step or three missing."
1803677434,510938,2015/1/18,5,"This was delicious.  I am not vegan, however, I do enjoy a lot of vegan recipes. To the mixture, I added kalamata olive tapenade for extra oomph. Other than that, I made as directed. Love, love, love the cashew spread! Will use this often. It&#039;s nice to take a break from animal products now and then. This recipe surly did the trick. Thanks Psalmsome!"
2001722458,533575,2017/9/20,5,This surprisingly worked out really good 5/5.
1803050408,518015,2014/8/19,5,"This was terrific.  the Polenta was creamy and rich, and the Turkey was tangy and Flavorful.  When i tried this dish i couldn&#039;t stop eating it, the two components of Polenta and Turkey would have stood on there own, but together it was really incredible.  I would have this again any day.  putting the recipe together was not hard at all and the results were great."
1803050779,518015,2014/8/19,5,Great Dish.....
1803051069,518015,2014/8/19,5,This recipe was a big hit!
1803055453,518015,2014/8/20,5,Good to the last bite......
1803056088,518015,2014/8/21,5,"This recipe is amazing! This dish has become my favorite food, which I would eat everyday, if possible. The creamy mascarpone polenta is a subtle contrast to the tangy A1 sauce. The savory turkey blends perfectly with the sauce and polenta."
1803058579,518015,2014/8/22,5,"As we say in Texas, this meal would make the rabbit hug a hound. I don&#039;t think this recipe would serve 8. I had 3 helpings all by myself."
1803062017,518015,2014/8/23,5,"My wife and I tried this and though I&#039;m not a good cook, it was fairly easy and very delicious and we will definitely have it again in the near future."
1803061344,518015,2014/8/26,0,The only thing wrong with this meal is I couldn&#039;t stop till i thought id bust. yep 3 servings later it was love at first bite  the Polenta and the turkey realty complement each other 5 yummms
1198627,518015,2014/8/26,5,Super Yummy! Who new A-1 was not just for steaks.
1803076811,518015,2014/8/27,5,Keep the leftovers. This dish is even good re-heated.
1803072039,518015,2014/8/28,5,The mixing it was a nice suggestion. Great recipe.
1803080660,518015,2014/8/30,5,This was a SUPER meal. Everyone should try it.
1803101057,518015,2014/9/3,5,"Someone made this dish for me, and it was really good. GOT to learn how to make it."
1803101652,518015,2014/9/3,5,"I had this dish at a company potluck, and it was terrific. Now I have the recipe, and can&#039;t wait to make it for my family."
1803108520,518015,2014/9/6,5,"Had this at a potluck. All the dishes were good, but this one received the &quot;Best Entree&quot; award."
1803109127,518015,2014/9/6,5,"My girlfriend and I prepared this for my family get together. Now my family wants me to marry&lt;br/&gt;Carmen so they can continue being served this delightful, creamy, delicious dish. If we do get married, this will be a holiday favorite. Kudos to the chef who created this recipe."
2545728,521583,2016/3/10,5,"What a great recipe! I add some jalape&ntilde;os on top at the end, just to give it an extra kick ;) This was so easy to make! I will be adding this to my monthly recipes!"
2734801,497251,2013/3/13,5,So easy to make and really good- great with just a salad
169430,499748,2013/5/16,5,This certainly isn&#039;t shy on the lemon and I love it! I used a good part of it to dress a potato salad in place of mayo that worked great. Would you believe that it&#039;s a wonderful fresh tasting salad dressing as well? lol. I used it also on a salad of simple mixed greens and they were elevated to something special. I used Meyer lemons by the way to make this simple and yummy dressing/vinaigrette.
2597942,499748,2013/6/30,5,"Just wanted to let you know that I just prepared your Lemon Dressing for tonight&#039;s dinner (I tagged it on PRMR). Anyway... I&#039;m going to use it as a marinade for our boneless skinless chicken breasts tonight. I was gonna toss them in the baggie with the dressing for a few hours, but the lemon is so strong, I&#039;m afraid it will start cooking the chicken in the fridge! LOL. I&#039;m only gonna marinate for 30 minutes before grilling them. That should be plenty.It tastes good so far... I will let you know how they turn out. UPDATE: This was perfect for a marinade for our chicken. I marinated them for approx 25-30 minutes. (I did not have fresh basil, so I used 2 teaspoons of dried from the shaker bottle and it worked well). Wonderful concoction, my dear! I will definately use this again! Thank you for posting your recipe."
2727323,497251,2013/3/11,5,These are a fantastic treat! Kids loved them
363055,497101,2013/3/11,5,"I liked this.  I was worried about the peanut butter, but I thought it tasted just right.  I used shrimp instead of chicken."
131126,497101,2013/4/13,5,"I enjoy the ease of  stir frys.  They make such a quick dinner.  This one didn&#039;t disappoint in speed or flavor.  I used red and green peppers, preshredded carrots, and threw in a drained can of bamboo shoots.  I added a half teaspoon of sesame oil to the sauce. The sauce is sweet and I liked the nutty flavor.   Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef."
1706426,503977,2013/7/23,5,"Quite good! I loved the splash of orange. I went very light on the cinnamon and sugar and it was just perfect. Thanks for sharing! Made for Ramadan, 2013"
1052873,503977,2013/8/22,5,"How can you go wrong with cinnamoned peaches? Tastes like peach pie, my favorite! Made for ZWT9."
804550,503977,2013/12/5,5,"I had to make this recipe using oranges as I chose the wrong time of year for peaches apparently. Anyway, I used navel oranges and it made for a very nice dessert. Made for NA*ME tag."
418718,514852,2014/3/25,5,your recipe sounds very good!
2201427,514852,2014/3/25,5,Sounds delicious ...... a must try..... 5 stars for sure!!
2198132,514852,2014/3/26,5,Sounds yummy!
2216338,514852,2014/3/27,5,sounds like a winner! sw?
2201870,514852,2014/3/28,5,Yum
2597942,513016,2014/5/11,4,"Made these cookie bars this afternoon to take to the neighbors cook-out / bon-fire this evening. These were very easy to put together and the flavor was pretty tasty. The texture was a bit strange, but I&#039;m assuming that is because it uses a cake mix. I will try making these again, and maybe skip the walnuts next time. Thanks for posting. (Made for PAC 2014)"
1802772108,506220,2014/5/26,5,wow they taste really good
305531,532629,2017/8/2,5,This was a hit at my house. Pretty easy and so good. It would be perfect with noodles to catch more of the sauce. Thanks for sharing Jackie. Made for CQ4.
107135,504394,2014/3/11,5,"first off, miss you girl. 2nd rudy mom makes these and shes czech , very good basic recipe  warm comfort food  made for pammyowls cookathon"
2909438,499120,2013/7/20,5,Good
285039,499120,2013/8/8,4,I had an average piece of salmon in the freezer and was looking for a nice salad recipe to use it up!  This salad was a fantastic way to do so!  I used Panera&#039;s Asian dressing instead of the one suggested.
452355,497999,2013/11/13,5,"This recipe is easy to make, and it is filling and flavorful.  I thought it had a nice amount of heat (besides the jalape&ntilde;o, I used a blend of Madras curry powder and hotter curry powder).  Ours did take quite a bit longer to thicken to a good consistency than what the recipe specified.  We served with garlic naan from Trader Joe&#039;s.  Thanks!"
1803650388,520769,2015/2/8,5,This chicken was so good and packed with flavor. I will recommend this to everyone!
2000170041,520769,2015/7/11,5,I am anxious to try!
1802778489,500694,2014/5/28,5,"This is a great salad!  It is really flavorful versatile and packs a healthy dose of protein and fiber.   was very popular at a party.  It packs well for picnics and lunches and stays crisp for 5+ days.  It is great plain but can also be put on a bed of lettuce or in a pita pocket, and is great with added leftover chicken.  It makes a great main dish and a tasty side dish as well.  It is very easy to scale down this recipe.  The servings listed are for main course size- if you are going to be using it as a side you will get a lot more servings."
2584658,494169,2016/2/6,4,"This &quot;mid-century&quot; salad is one of my favorites.  I had leftover lobster and used it and shrimp in the salad.  The reason I didn&#039;t give this recipe 5 stars was that I didn&#039;t think the black olives added any flavor and the cucumber was kind of in the way.   The sweet cherry tomatoes are perfect and you need the hard cooked egg, but next time I&#039;m leaving out the cuke and olives, and adding some capers.  The dressing, from the same cook, is absolutely 5 star!"
1808377,494169,2017/9/15,5,"Great salad, I threw in some avocado and it was awesome."
2002061921,534896,2018/3/19,2,gross or good? i think too many carbs
2002064796,534896,2018/3/20,1,"IMHO, That recipe is disgusting!"
1802640303,515167,2014/4/3,5,perfect amount of sweetness
1802640317,515167,2014/4/3,5,tastes awesome
1802640322,515167,2014/4/3,5,"was a hit in this house, family really enjoyed it"
1802640735,515167,2014/4/3,5,nice recipe!
498271,494108,2013/2/19,4,Great fun way to prepare eggplant!  I love eggplant parmesan and this is a fun finger-food version.  Slicing the eggplant super-thin makes it easier to get them crispy without getting too dark.  Served as you suggested with marinara for dipping and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!
1802642523,515167,2014/4/4,5,Very tasteful recipe!
1680722,503249,2014/4/7,5,"What for a lovely combination of ingredients!&lt;br/&gt;I prepared the grits as described and but I replace the andouille sausage and the bacon with Turkish salami, with I prepared as described for the bacon. I used about 12 slices in this way. After cooking down on the paper towel I crumbed them lightly. The most I added to the shrip mixture and a few for the topping.&lt;br/&gt;I confess I would have never combined all those ingredients myself and we were really very suprised from the results. Thanks a lot for posting your recipe here, I really appreciate this.&lt;br/&gt;I tagged your recipe and tried it for the game: Pick a chef 2014 (http://www.food.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=402517&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0)"
2000009491,503249,2015/3/6,5,"GREAT RECIPE!!!  I followed the directions exactly as written, however I left out the sausage because I didn&#039;t have any.  I can only imagine how great it would have been
with the addition of sausage.  My daughter said, &quot;You can fix this anytime.&quot;  Thanks for such a great recipe."
2000226298,503249,2015/5/25,5,This is a delicious recipe...the ONLY change I made was that I used Gouda cheese instead of cheddar.  PLEASE stop rewriting recipes and then saying they are wonderful.  Let&#039;s face it.  If you take the Andouille sausage and bacon out of this recipe it will be crap.  Some recipes need to be left alone. I&#039;m sick of reading these reviews saying how THEY took out 3/4 of the ingredients and it was WON-der-ful.  No it isn&#039;t...the recipe is awesome...leave it alone.
1803019290,517764,2014/8/11,0,Excellent!
1803019357,517764,2014/8/11,5,"Simple, yet sophisticated."
1803019339,517764,2014/8/11,5,Seriously delicious! Easy enough to get on the table quickly!
1803019366,517764,2014/8/11,5,My family loved this dish!
1802936715,527325,2017/1/14,5,Big hit! Used oven ready noodles and no ricotta since I don't like it. No one knew the difference and I would make again!
1802936715,512383,2014/11/18,5,It was a hit with the whole family!  Will make it again for sure!
1803019382,517764,2014/8/11,5,Wonderful dish we loved it!!
482376,512383,2014/2/21,5,"Excellent meal! This worked really well when we had company for dinner. Once all the ingredients were in the pot, I could sit and relax with my guests. The only change I made was to use brown Jasmine rice. This is a comforting and flavorful meal! Thank you for posting this gem."
546010,512383,2014/2/24,5,"The flavors are AMAZING! A beautiful dish and company worthy. I forgot to rinse the rice but all is well. I also use hearty chicken breasts, skin on, then removed the skin and cut chicken into individual portions. It turned out very moist. My paprika was smokey but not hot. My sweet bell peppers were yellow &amp; orange. I think red would make for more contrast with the same flavors. Thanks for posting this gem, French Tart. It&#039;s a keeper and going into the &quot;Best of &#039;14&quot; cookbook!"
1803167875,512383,2014/9/28,0,"I cannot rave about this recipe enough! The flavour, the textures, the look.... I felt like a master chef.  I used smoked sausage in the absence of chorizo and also had no creme f on board but it still was a total triumph."
1803274433,512383,2014/11/14,5,"Another fantastic Food.com recipe. My family cleaned their plates. I bought the crumbly version of pork chorizo instead of sliced. That was all I could find. The sausage integrated into the rice very nicely and the spiciness was perfect for Texan palates. . In fact, my family asked me to save the rice so they could eat the leftovers the next day even though the chicken was all gone. &nbsp;I used chicken breast since my family prefers it. Next time I think I&#039;ll try cubing the chicken instead of the larger 1 to 1-1/2&quot; chunks I cut. The bottom line is this recipe goes into our rotation of meals."
381047,512383,2014/11/22,5,"We enjoyed this, especially my husband.  He said, &quot;You don&#039;t have to change anything about THIS recipe!&quot;"
176615,512383,2014/12/24,5,"A good, easy to fix weeknight dinner. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1803551615,512383,2017/5/14,0,"Wow, this stuff is just lovely. I used twice as much chorizo because that's how it was packaged but otherwise followed the recipe exactly."
1802642599,515167,2014/4/4,5,5 stars+ - something new I enjoyed
204024,515372,2014/5/2,5,"We loved this potato salad.  I added 4 hard boiled eggs, otherwise followed all the ingredients.  Great combination of flavors.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
107135,517594,2014/8/9,5,a really nice pancake its wicked with twisses  peach butter  made for southern leg cakepops on parade
305531,517594,2014/8/12,5,"Loved this. I haven&#039;t made pancakes in years until just recently. This was really nice and I really enjoyed them. I did use a homemade buttermilk substitution and recipe #350883 for the topping. Thanks for sharing, Lynn. Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
128473,517594,2014/8/14,5,"Great pancakes Lynn. Light, tender, fluffy and full of flavor. We loved these buttermilk pancakes they were so quick and easy to make. Perfect served with a little icing sugar and melting butter. Yummm. So good. Made for Culinary Quest for the Suitcase Gourmets"
526666,517594,2014/8/14,5,"These were a real treat, made by my DH for Sunday breakfast. We halved the recipe and it made 9 nice sized pancakes. I did have to &#039;cheat&#039; and use the buttermilk sub mentioned in the directions, which worked out just fine! Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe, Lavender Lynn."

Served with maple syrup, preserves and honey so everyone could top as they wished.  I went traditional on my one pancake with the maple syrup - fluffy texture."

2001467418,517594,2017/4/1,5,Excellent recipe. I only had 1 cup of buttermilk so I used 1 cup of milk instead. Still came out great. So fluffy and flavorful.

679953,494714,2013/3/14,5,"Being from the Chicago area, and having been to Chi Town numerous times, we have had deep dish pizza plenty of times, and this one ranks up there.   I left out the salt and pepper, used the parmesan cheese, and the italian seasonings.  I would recommend the italian seasonings on this.  Very easy to prepare too, This does top one of the famous pizza eateries in Chicago by far, I won&#039;t mention who, because I do not know if I can, so with that being said, next month when I go to Chicago we will stop by one of the Chicago sports legends restaurant, and have a steak sandwich instead.  Very easy, and very very good.  Made for PRMR tag."

305531,494714,2013/6/17,5,"I liked this a lot! It truly tasted like a thin crust pizza to me. I made everything as directed (with optional ingredients), but didn&#039;t have quite enough pizza sauce so added maybe 1/4 cup marinara sauce to the mix. Your pic looks great....and a perfect slice of pizza pie. Mine was a little looser and didn&#039;t maintain the shape. :lol: Regardless of how mine looked - it tasted great. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for PRMR Tag."
2597942,494714,2013/12/18,5,"I made this tonight for dinner. We loved it! I, too, am from the Chicago-land area. This is pretty close to restaurant quality pizza pies (and even better than some). I used ground Italian sausage in mine. The only thing I changed with this recipe is that I left the mushrooms out (I just don&#039;t like them). I look forward to making this again. (It&#039;s a lot cheaper than going out for one). Thanks for posting. (Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag)"
724631,494714,2014/1/7,4,"A complete change of pace for us, didn&#039;t know we were inculcated in NY Pizza until I tagged this recipe.  This recipe made me think!  This recipe is all about the SAUSAGE, so make sure you have mighty fine sausage.  Chicago is the meat-packing capital of the world, so there you can probably find wonderful sausage almost anywhere.  I used Johnsonville Sweet Italian, which is about the best sausage we get in the greater Baltimore area, UNLESS YOU MAKE THE SAUSAGE YOURSELF.  This recipe almost requires that you make your own sausage.  In the past year, I have been disappointed with most commercial sausage I have tried -- too much gristle! Not enough flavor!  I found myself dreaming of Wild Boar sausage from DH&#039;s past hunting expeditions. The pie crust is not as odd as one might think. Chicago pizza dough DOES NOT CONTAIN CORNMEAL and it does rely heavily on CORN OIL; it is usually THICK, almost like a biscuit base, but tasting more like pastry pie crust in its flakiness. The thin pie crust allowed me to add all of the ingredients for this recipe, but my pie didn&#039;t firm up for a decent slice until 30 minutes after I removed it from the oven.  I believe that a thicker crust would have sped up that process.  As for pizza sauce, I made my own using Recipe #413005 reduced to pizza sauce thickness and jazzed up as I saw fit.  It worked fine.  Back to the NY pizza bias: normally I would ask for &quot;extra sauce&quot;, but in this recipe, that would be ridiculous!  In the end, I applaud your effort, you made me think outside my box.  Next project: authentic Chicago pizza dough!  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag."
64780,494714,2017/7/8,5,Delicious &amp; Sooooo &quot;ridiculously&quot; easy!! Love it!!! Thanks!!
2002270079,494714,2018/9/9,5,Mine came out pretty good. I like the buttery pie crust and I added some fresh tomatoes and basil on top. I had not one but two slices.

Healthy living is mostly discipline and some of it are just knowing what and what not to do. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing this recipe. I&#039;m adding this to my current cookbook recipe.

So glad I found this recipe, you don't have to squeeze out the liquid, peel or shred the potatoes. These are also great cooked just like the package instructs, I have been using these hash brown for years!"
400708,505681,2013/8/17,5,"Playing &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot; game and chose this recipe.  It was so creamy and great  depth of flavor, very different from my regular gravy.  I served with Chicken instead of steak so did use chicken stock - but sure it would be good either way.  Trouble is - DH usually makes the gravy in this house but after I made this and he tried it - he says now I&#039;ll have to do it from now on as this is so much better.  We&#039;ll have to see about that, maybe I just need to give him this recipes :rofl:"
125853,505681,2014/3/23,0,WOW!  This is as good as my  mother&#039;s gravy...maybe even better.  It really dresses a steak up.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 and it worked just fine!

2001172699,494471,2016/9/18,4,This recipe was really easy and good as posted - glossy and rich. I added a little instant espresso powder to give it a darker taste.
1802447792,500068,2014/2/2,4,"Very good dip but NOT at all like Montana&#039;s dip. Seems similar to the Lone Star restaurant&#039;s dip but I haven&#039;t had that in over a year so I can&#039;t be sure. There are no Cajun spices in Montana&#039;s dip and no cheddar. At least, not in Canada. Still a good dip though. Just a little kick to it but you could easily add more hot sauce or experiment with varieties."
452355,501321,2013/6/17,5,"This was a VERY easy weeknight meal and we enjoyed it.  I used medium salsa, 2Tb of a grilled leftover red pepper, and I omitted the bed of salad. DH didn&#039;t bother cutting the quesadillas ahead of time.  He just spread the filling and grilled them whole, then sliced them with a knife into the appropriate sized wedges before serving.

I ran out of the door this morning and totally forgot to put the sliced banana and chocolate chips on top but it doesn’t even need it! It tastes like peanut butter cookies but has so little sugar. I bought half pint jars at my grocery store because it fits in my lunchbox better. I don’t have any tweaks. The only oatmeal I had was organic Bob’s red Mill oats, that we’re not rolled, but it still worked great. I also used Fage 0% Greek yogurt to cut even more sugar out."

724631,496890,2013/5/2,4,"Indian curries benefit from long simmering to help the spices blend; these flavors hadn&#039;t fully mellowed by the time of this dish was served, so I would tweak before making this again.  The full can of coconut milk seemed too much (the end result was very saucy), so I think a can of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans could be added to make a complete but vegetarian meal, or the vegetables could be increased (even doubled).  I&#039;m still new to Indian cooking (although obsessed with it), but I would introduce the coconut milk earlier to allow all to simmer longer and let the coconut milk to reduce.  I think most people would serve this over rice.  I used a drained 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of 2 medium tomatoes, which worked fine for me.  Please consider re-ordering the ingredients in the order used in the recipe as the cooking progresses rather quickly.  This recipe is worth tweaking for a tasty vegetarian dish.

I did not have a pumpkin so just upped the turnip added an extra carrot and 2 stalks celery.  Dh kind of looked at me funny when I put it on the table then tasted it and really liked this dish.  The flavors are wonderful!!! I love the freshness of the veggies and they were not so mushy, the roasting gave them a sweet taste and the garlic was to die for! I love roasted garlic!! I can see this as a go to meal all summer long.  I may have to try this on the grill in foil wrap on those hot days when you really do not want the oven on.  Paula as usual another great dish from you.  We did not have muffins so each of us had a slice of homemade Italian bread (thin sliced) to sop up juices from the veggies.  Made for May 2013 Aussie Swap."
386585,496543,2014/3/11,4,"This was a nice simple meal that makes you feel positively virtuous eating it!  While it is time-consuming chopping all the vegetables, it is certainly very easy to make.  I used butternut squash and 12 oz.  of chicken sausage.  For the mustard, I used Country Dijon, which is nice and coarse.  I had to use a large rimmed sheet pan, because it was a lot of ingredients for a baking dish.  This was a great idea, and a great use of multiple vegetables.  The roasting really enhances their flavor.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #86."

I served this with a side salad, and it was a filling dinner. I used prepared bread crumbs instead of fresh, and I used parmesan cheese rather than the &quot;blend,&quot; as specified in the recipe. This was a delicious way to use summer farmer&#039;s market zucchini, tomato and bell pepper. I will be just as good in the winter with frozen veggies."

323186,505459,2015/1/15,5,"Loved this different pizza!!   Made one or two small changes,  going with what I had :   I used chicken rather than turkey and added some shrimps coz I like them.  I didn&#039;t have fresh coriander (although I did use bottled coriander  in the sauce), so where I needed fresh coriander, I used fresh Thai Basil instead, which grows in the garden.    I sliced a fresh tomato and layered it on the base,   mostly because I had it.   I didn&#039;t have mozzarella, so used some cheddar instead.  Sounds like a lot of changes, but was minimal, and the important part, the sauce, was as recipe ---  very yum, I loved it, we both did!!!    It looked prettier until I added the soy sauce : another time I might omit the soy sauce in order to get a prettier result, the sauce was very dark -- delicious,  mind you!   Really liked this,  Nancy,  thank you for sharing!   Made for Consideration Tag"
486725,505459,2017/4/18,5,"What a sensational pizza. I knew I was going to love it, but I didn't know just how much I was going to love it. And the big surprise was DH loving it too, when it didn't sound as appealing to him. I made a few minor changes: used chicken (and a lesser amount), added basil as well (about the same amount as the cilantro, and topped with both just before serving) and less brown sugar. We did use the optional cheese, but I think it would be just as good either way. All the flavors were spot on, and the lime really gave it a wonderful tang. This fed two big eaters as the sole dinner entree."

305531,508499,2014/5/7,5,Yummers! I don&#039;t usually care for meatloaf with a ketchup based sauce but decided to give this one a try. My grandson raved about it.. It was easy to throw together and had a great texture and taste. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
1802644692,515167,2014/4/5,5,it&#039;s the only way I&#039;ll be making my potato salad from now!
895132,516965,2014/11/16,5,"I&#039;ve already made this months ago but somehow forgot to come back and review! Actually I&#039;ve already made a second batch, this is divine! I didn&#039;t have merlo salt, so I just added a splash of merlot wine. Definitely the most awesome chili sauce I&#039;ve made so far. Thanks for sharing! :)"
169430,493758,2013/1/23,5,"I love this recipe, really. I used dried apple which is, of course, well paired with the cinnamon. Not having any orange juice in the house I used the same amount of water with brandy extract added (yum). You will need to let the mix sit for 20/25 mins to allow the liquid to be absorbed enough to make a batter. I got 10 double sized muffins that needed to be baked for almost 20 mins. My oven was set at 380 because it runs hot. They look rustic, and are down home good, as well as being good for you. :D"
1802425003,493666,2014/1/30,5,I found the flavor to be fantastic and really enjoyed them. I may add more sauce on the bottom just because I like a little on the side to dip or even for topping some mashed potatoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I may try this seasoning blend with cabbage as well.
128473,493047,2013/12/28,5,"These tasty potatoes are the bomb.  So good, great flavor and amazing textures.  The potatoes were really quick and easy to throw together, with ingredients always found in the fridge and pantry.  The crispy potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned, the cheese was a great touch. We enjoyed these spuds very much, thanks so much for sharing your recipe Chef #772690 ."
2800584,498315,2013/4/25,5,I TOO found this exact recipe on facebook. Absolutely the best cake I have ever made. So moist...very sweet...only need a small slice at a time. And you can throw it.together usually with what you have on hand... no sour cream...no buttermilk..no stupid fancy ingrediants. Perfection.
2807474,498315,2013/4/30,4,I have made this cake twice now- a real fan favourite! In my second cake I reduced the amount of butter that I added to the topping to 3/4 cup. Not a whole lot of difference but it did cook more evenly. I also increased the amount of &quot;swirling&quot; I did second time around to get more cinnamon into the cake. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made the cake in a spring form pan - it makes for a nice presentation.
711783,498315,2013/7/26,0,My grandson and I made this cake. Everyone loved it. We made just as the recipe called for.&lt;br/&gt;And I would not change anything
1777330,498315,2014/1/29,5,"So delicious! This cake was particularly easy to make and the directions were pretty straight forward. I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I would change, is to add more icing, delicious! ;) I did swirl the topping quite a bit to make sure it was evenly distributed, as the mixture doesn&#039;t fully allow for that. i am not a sweets person, but this will a treat I will make often! Thank you for this recipe to be used for years to come! :)"
1740853,498315,2014/3/14,5,This cake is so yummy! I added big chunks of chopped Granny Smith apples before the topping then added toasted pecans on top after swirling the topping. It is soooo good! I guess now it&#039;s a apple pecan cinabun cake.
1802738581,498315,2014/5/13,5,I won second place at a baking contest we held at the store where I work making this!
936601,498315,2014/6/14,5,This is a great recipe originally saw this in a pampered chef cookbook. I made exactly except to 1/2 the topping recipe and glaze. It was just right.
2000452390,498315,2016/8/19,5,DELICIOUS and very easy to make. I made it take to work and it received rave reviews. Now pinned to my &quot;It's a keeper&quot; board. One small change I made was to halve the quantity of butter in the topping mix. My cake tested done at 25 minutes. Will definitely be making this again.
2286743,518196,2017/8/2,3,"Easy and pretty, but the taste is bland. It needs more of a raspberry flavor. Maybe add pureed raspberries? It tastes mostly of whipped topping and creamcheese."
2001583547,533919,2017/11/5,4,I used salted butter so I eliminated a teaspoon of salt from the recipe.
1802644757,515167,2014/4/5,5,"Satisfied my cravings for potato salad, thanks for the recipe!"
1802645685,515167,2014/4/6,5,tasty recipe
1802646278,515167,2014/4/6,5,Tummy pleaser!
107135,503641,2013/9/4,5,"a nice sipping  drink,  zwt9"
1802644711,515167,2014/4/6,5,5 thumbs up! (Well in this case 5 stars!)
1802646284,515167,2014/4/6,5,Served this at an event I held and it was a hit
1802646299,515167,2014/4/6,5,loved trying this !
227978,502484,2014/5/21,4,"My rating is a little deceptive, bkellum.  Because the taste of this peach cobbler recipe is 5 Stars all the way...one of the BEST peach cobblers I&#039;ve ever made.  But something didn&#039;t go right (the batter didn&#039;t cook all the way and was too gooey and raw in the center).  I&#039;m not sure if I made a mistake or there&#039;s a flaw in my slow cooker.  I put each serving in the microwave, and that cooked the batter a little more.  I wanted to try it again to perfect the procedures, but I&#039;m a little pressed for time this week (two funerals to attend or plan).  But I know I&#039;ll make this again, and I&#039;ll re-rate this if I can make this recipe work for my slow cooker.  It is super yummy though, so it&#039;s definitely worth trying."
274057,502484,2014/7/28,5,I am giving this cobbler five stars because I didn&#039;t have to light the oven!  It is a shame to go without fresh fruit cobbler during hot summer months.  This recipe is super easy and almost as good as oven baked!  I used fresh apricots and cooked about 20 minutes longer until the bread was starting to brown well around the edges.  Very good!
1802646305,515167,2014/4/6,5,Definitely an all star recipe!
1802646308,515167,2014/4/6,5,simply potabulous!
1802652318,515167,2014/4/8,5,yummy
1802652321,515167,2014/4/8,5,"Loved the taste, it&#039;s my new favorite way to make potato salad."
169430,506626,2013/9/9,5,I used basic Tetleys tea and Splenda in place of the sugar. The recipe made a lovely refreshing glass of iced tea with a not too strong orange flavor. I&#039;m sure that everyone (who likes iced tea&#039;s) will enjoy this delightful version of the always needed summer iced tea. Thanks Sharon for another keeper. :D
804550,506626,2013/10/1,5,"A very refreshing flavorful beverage. I normally don&#039;t sweeten my iced tea, however this brought back childhood memories of sitting in lawn chairs at my grandparent&#039;s farmette. My grandmother made iced tea in a similar way. Thanks for the memoies! Made for Veg &#039;n Swap tag."
2668629,494359,2013/1/31,5,Sounds yummy!  I am looking forward to making it for my friends.
280271,512296,2014/5/13,5,These were delicious...I cut the recipe down to 2 servings...wasn&#039;t sure if the ribs were to be boneless but that&#039;s what I used...I cooked them the full 2 1/2 hours...they were nice and tender and full of flavor...you get the heat but just a touch of it...there&#039;s not enough sauce to use over rice...so I served it next to horseradish mashed potato&#039;s...and a side of broccoli...thanks for sharing your recipe...=)
266635,512296,2014/5/22,5,"We really enjoyed these short ribs.  The sauce is very flavorful and a little spicy -- not too much though.  The only change I made was to omit the green bell pepper, add a little more tomato sauce and I cooked these short ribs in my slow cooker.  Served these ribs and this delicious sauce over rice.  Will definitely make them again.  Made for PRMR, May, 2014."
131126,512296,2015/1/10,5,"I used slightly over two pounds of bone-in country pork ribs and half of the amounts for the sauce.  Note: I used a Sam Adams juniper beer. The ribs were extremely tender, slightly spicy hot, and wonderfully flavorful.  Next time I will make the full amount of sauce and leave a few seeds in the jalapenos. Yum! Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
2672594,494359,2013/2/2,5,Delicious! Cajun & blue cheese - two of my husbands faves!!
2682091,494359,2013/2/7,5,this sounds awesome.  what could be bad about cajun ranch sauce and chicken
2667767,494359,2013/2/8,5,Anything with blue cheese gets my vote :)-
2679429,494359,2013/2/9,5,Cajun Sauce sounds great!
2000941301,509482,2016/3/26,5,Amazing and easy.....thank you for that......but....too much salt in dough...WHY?....lessen salt turns perfect!
2324285,498562,2013/5/19,4,"Very flavorful and so easy to prepare.  I used canned artichokes and fresh cauliflower, with good results."
2000498330,526660,2017/2/26,5,"A Cook's Country recipe that is a favorite at my house. Super simple, rustic, hearty meal. Love."
2684929,494359,2013/2/9,5,A great combination flavors and the surprise is the the corn sauce.
2685254,494359,2013/2/9,5,"Yum, yum blue cheese and Cajun!"
2201427,494359,2013/2/14,5,This is an awesome recipe!  A new family favorite for sure....
2665107,494359,2013/2/14,5,"Got around to making this recipe, really enjoyed the corn sauce."
107135,508238,2013/10/28,5,this is a very tasty tart applesauce
1287956,505317,2013/8/12,5,"First off, I was happy to see a recipe where I can use our Scotch Bonnets.  Now I just need to find recipes for our Ghost Peppers and Trinidad Scorpions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first glance, this recipe looks complicated, but it really wasn&#039;t.  Started it the day before, and got the meat marinating.  Next day, I actually cooked the meat a couple of hours longer because I wanted it to be fork tender.  Next time I make this (and there will be a next time with this!), I&#039;m going to add a couple of extra Scotch Bonnets because it was just too tame for us.  It was just so flavorful and delicious.  Could&#039;ve even used it as a chili verde and ate it with refried beans and tortillas."
340141,505317,2013/8/13,5,"What a wonderful flavor!   I thought this was a little tedious to produce with all the different steps, but it was well worth it.   I don&#039;t have a blender, so I just minced everything.  As a result, I didn&#039;t really have a paste to carmelize on the last step.   However, the flavor was still really excellent.   I just spooned a tablespoon of the greatly-reduced sauce over the fried pork at the end.  YUM!"
67728,527456,2016/7/26,4,"Wow, mixing the milks is quite the arm workout, lol! Once everything is incorporated, this magically turns into something not unlike nougat in texture. These are rich and sweet, although not as rich and sweet as one might expect from a candy that is basically sweetened condensed milk rolled in sugar. I definitely disagree with the four servings. I got about 14 little ~2 1/2&quot; long rolls out of this after looking at the blog for direction, and I can't imagine that anyone but those with a demonic-level sweet tooth could eat much more than one or two rolls at a sitting (this coming from a rabid buttercream frosting eater!). Not sure I would classify this as a dessert, either. This is more of a candy/confection, although there are people out there who grab a couple mints or hard candies off the counter in restaurants after dinner and call that dessert, so to each his own. I didn't have any pretty colored cellophane to wrap these in, so I just opted for pieces of garden-variety plastic wrap. Not as cute, but it did the job. Just some tips for ease of handling: this stuff is super-sticky and thick, so be sure to either oil or wet your hands before even thinking about sticking them in the bowl to grab the mixture, and repeat as needed. Also, do not lay the rolls down before you sugar them, or you will need a bench knife to get them back up again. Much easier to dip as you roll each one (I learned this the hard way!). Lastly, don't bother scrubbing the bowl with your mixing-fatigued arms -- just fill it with hot water and some dish soap, and come back later when everything has melted off on it's own. Now I'd like to try the cooked version with liquid milk instead of the powdered milk. Thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest 2016 Phillipines for Team Iota Eta Pi"
1802767046,513616,2014/5/26,5,I cooked this on top of the stove in an hour and it was just wonderful.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.
2585084,501172,2013/6/21,2,"It didn&#039;t dawn on me that the ingredients list was missing the flour until I put it in the oven.  I let it bake anyway.  It came out with a saucy texture.  I loved it on ice cream.  I suggest that It be re-submitted as an ice cream sauce.  it was incredible over vanilla ice cream.  I hid in the back of the refrigerator so I could keep it to myself.  If this were an ice cream topping, I&#039;d give it five stars."
2737756,497320,2013/3/15,5,Tried this recipe and it was absolutely delicious!!!!
2555126,497320,2013/3/20,5,I couldn&#039;t stop eating these won tons! These are the perfect side item and a great way to spice up serving mashed potatoes.

266635,503811,2013/8/22,4,This is a really nice slow cooker recipe.  I marinated the chicken thighs overnight and then prepared the remainder of the ingredients this morning.  It was easy to put together and had nice results.  I think next time I will add spices to the veggies and broth as well so it can pick up the same flavors as the chicken as it cooks.  We served this dish with rice as I had run out of couscous (go figure).  Served this meal with a side salad and had a great meal tonight.  Made for ZWT9.
39835,503811,2013/8/24,5,"This is a very good dish which we enjoyed! I made a few changes by only marinating the chicken for a few hours before putting in the the crockpot. I also used the whole can of chicken broth (which I think is 2 cups) and as I did not have dried apricots, used a can of unsweetened apricots, drained. This was a very sweet stew - we served it in bowls as soup/stew. Thanks for sharing! ZWT9"
2002240205,536455,2018/8/5,5,This is recipe is really tasty! Nephew loves it!
199848,500788,2013/10/26,5,"Delicious and colorful!  I made this using the cumin seed variation and various colors of bell peppers.  Very nice flavors.  I&#039;m not a huge fan of plain fried eggs, so this was perfect for me.  I served this with pitas.  Thanx for posting!"
2462118,500788,2013/10/29,4,"I made this for my husband and myself for dinner. I served it with rice. We found it very filling, but ended up adding a bit of Sriracha sauce for a bit of a kick. Very easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand which was a bonus. I&#039;ll probably make this again when I have no clue what else to make for dinner."
1052873,504681,2015/1/6,4,"I had leftover smoked salmon to use up, so tried this. Seems like the flavor cooked out of the salmon, so was more diluted. Used uncooked potatoes and had to cook for 90 minutes."
2000045537,510832,2015/3/8,5,"I made your recipe with a bear roast. It was simple to prepare. The smell from the roast when it was cooking was wonderful. After removing the roast from the pan, I made the gravy following the recipe as described, it was also very easy. It was my frist time cooking bear and it was easy with this recipe.This recipe was fast to prep and fun to do! The bear came out great - be sure to take the garlic cloves out of you beef after you slice it and before you serve it! The gravey was excellent. I will be useing this recipe again. It was our frist time cooking bear and we invited friends over.They said I did a great job .Thank you old so much for your recipe. Thank you for posting it!!

498271,493719,2013/2/7,5,"Terrific recipe!  I used chopped walnuts instead of pine nuts as I had some on hand, otherwise made as directed.  Nice and hearty with a great combination of flavors.

482376,493719,2015/1/26,5,"Thank you for a different and tasty zucchini recipe. I halved the amount and still had plenty of zucchini. I served it as a side, but it really could be a meatless main dish. Thank you!"
126440,495559,2013/2/16,4,Great recipe that we will have often.  Easy to do.  I wasn't sure about the amount of sugar so used 1 1/2 t. for my half recipe.  Served over rice and was very filling.  Loved the sesame oil in the pork.
1800068686,528131,2016/9/21,3,It is ok. Too chocolatey less chip and less sugar our 1 year old son love it

2371734,528131,2016/9/26,1,"Ended up gummy in texture and unpleasant, nothing like the picture. Microwaved for an additional 30 seconds and the texture was a bit more like a Cookie, but still not good at all."
2001355800,528131,2017/1/17,1,"Wouldn't recommend trying it, recipe didn't call for baking soda or powder though it is in most cookies. I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda and it was more pancake-ish than cookie-ish. Strange flavour, isn't very cookie-like at all and I even made it vegan. (Silk instead of milk and becel vegan marg instead of butter) Wasn't impressed and did not chill out my cookie craving. Sadly, I give it 1 star."
2001446999,528131,2017/3/20,5,5 stars with the following corrections: - Use 2 tablespoons of white granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of 3-4 tablespoons of just brown sugar - Use low-fat milk tastes just like an actual chocolate chip cookie and is perfectly soft and moist.
2001598827,528131,2017/6/25,5,I love it! I live in Colorado so I added about 1-2 tbsp of flour and it turned out perfect. I also topped it with peanut butter :)
2001694243,528131,2017/8/30,3,"Strange taste, consistency would of been better with more milk"
2001838304,528131,2017/12/4,3,"Made it with gluten free flour and extra chocolate chips while following my own measurements and they came out pretty goo-ey and chocolate-y. Would do again, although it isn't the most amazing thing."
2001849065,528131,2017/12/10,0,Did not have creamer or chips so added a caramel machiatto creamer with just a little extra flour to make up for extra moisture. Yumm.

2002163112,528131,2018/5/28,4,was a great base recipe!!!!
2002242308,528131,2018/8/8,5,I make a couple tweaks to this recipe. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk and 3 tsp of cocoa powder because I didn't have any chocolate chips. So it pretty turned out to be a chocolate cookie instead of a chocolate chip cookie... But it was really good. It was really rich...I decided to share it with my mom...
1802592496,504635,2014/3/17,5,"Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It turned out really well - soft with a good texture and slightly sweet flavor, not sour.  I think this will be my go-to recipe for preparing sandwich bread for my family."
2000987876,504635,2018/7/6,3,"Thank you for sharing your recipe. I followed the instruction as much as I could, but the bread came out with a crumb that is not as open as your photo shows and the crust is much too smooth (I'd be in the elimination round on master chef for that bread :). While kneading it, I had to add at least a cup of milk. I ended up kneading by hand for another 10 minutes as my mixer was getting too hot. It didn't rise as much I as would have liked it but that might be because it is winter here and the temperatures are fluctuating a lot. The last rise was over night. Then I had to add another 10 minutes to the baking time. The softness and the taste is nice. I'll make this bread again adding more milk from the start. I'll report :)"
2367537,502840,2013/7/3,5,I first tried your garlic spaghetti  then this I must say I have been cooking a long time but both of these recipes blew me away  Wonderful  will be making these again an again  and yes we LOVE garlic

2000093890,507286,2015/3/28,3,"No-way is this a &quot;Copy Cat&quot; recipe of Starbucks Cranberry-Orange muffins. It&#039;s just your standard muffin recipe with some nuts, cranberries and oj peelings thrown in. Also, no mention of muffin size bake-ware. Granted, I generally use the lager muffin size tins, but I could only fill 12 cups half way - not good. I have no idea how this writer could substantiate 16 muffins, unless they&#039;re bite-size! While it&#039;s true that you should never overwork muffin batter, if you want &quot;&quot;fluffy&quot;

2956130,503243,2013/8/23,5,"I just made these, and they are delicious! I changed the recipe to make 10 total. I used 1 roll out pie crust and actually only ended up with 5 and a little bit of apple left over but not really enough for another pie. I used a large drinking glass to cut the crusts. I do think that the roll out crust is a little thick for this. The only thing I would change is to roll the crust a little thinner. All in all - delicious. I served them (to myself) hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. Yum! Thanks for the recipe."
2001886772,503243,2018/1/24,5,I made them but I didn't use cupcake holders. I just rolled the dough handmade a few little squares and larger ones. Then I just made an open pie. They were good but I think I would have liked the phylo dough effect better just cause I like it. But your dough was great. Sandy

510901,498220,2014/6/16,5,"I had been wanting to try a method that did not use bread  crumbs . This tastes much lighter, not so heavy as with bread crumbs. It was good just by itself with no sauce too. Really glad I tried it. Thanks for sharing."
2001018960,494452,2016/5/20,0,"Wow!. This brings back memories. Thank you, i just downloaded receipe for No Bake Oatmeal Cookies and i can't wait to make them tomorrow"
724631,509033,2014/5/15,0,"This didn&#039;t work for me, probably because I could not find Mexican Chocolate, and used Hershey&#039;s Natural Unsweetened Cocoa instead.  I don&#039;t blame the recipe.  By all means, do not use Hershey chocolate for this recipe; it is incompatible with this recipe.  To sample the sauce, I was glad I had made 1/4 the recipe, because I didn&#039;t have room in the freezer for a gallon of mole sauce anyway.  My results were so bad, I was happy to eat leftover shredded chicken from Recipe #369106 prepared in a 2-L pressure cooker with 2 large chicken breasts.  I guess I&#039;ll order some Mexican chocolate through Penzeys and try this again.  At least my beefeater tomatoes were from Mexico!  I&#039;m sure I was the problem; Rick Bayless is a great chef!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2469418,492884,2013/8/15,5,"When I found this recipe I was looking for a way to make pork that was not dried out. I also have food restrictions requiring me to eat gluten free, egg free, and dairy free. When I served this to my husband, he thoroughly enjoyed it. It was moist and tasty. I have used pork loin, pork chops, and then pork strips to make this recipe. I have made a full recipe and then only made a half recipe on another occasion."
369715,492884,2013/10/22,4,We all enjoyed this. I used three cans of sauerkraut as we like the kraut with mashed potatoes. I cooked mine for two hours and it was really good.
1802849661,517744,2015/1/8,3,"I liked the amount of banana in these - it&#039;s probably the most I&#039;ve ever seen, but the texture was a bit strange and there was too much sugar for my liking. I made them exactly as the recipe, they only took 20 minutes to bake. I would definitely reduce the amount of sugar if I made these again."
67728,494736,2014/4/17,5,"These were sooo good! I had exactly enough filling for one whole box of manicotti shells. I really liked the flavor that the cream cheese brought to the filling -- sometimes I find that pasta filled with pure ricotta cheese is just too, well, ricotta-y, but the cream cheese made this perfect. I didn&#039;t have any Paul Newman sauce, so I subbed in one jar of Barilla Traditional sauce and one big jar of Victoria marinara sauce. I think I ended up using more sauce than was required because the Victoria sauce was a Costco-sized jar, but it thickened up quite a bit in the oven, and we like pasta heavy on the sauce anyhow. I was initially worried that the pasta wouldn&#039;t soften enough if it wasn&#039;t pre-cooked, but it was just right after it&#039;s time in the oven (soft but not soggy). I could fit all but 4 of the manicotti in one big pan, so I put the last of the manicotti in a small (1.5 quart) Corningware dish. I was hoping to keep the smaller dish for photo purposes and leave the large casserole pan for DH to take his dinner from, but when I got home from work, I realized that DH had used the smaller dish as his dinner plate, lol. I think he liked them! Definitely a keeper, thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
480195,503895,2013/7/23,5,These were so quick and easy to make. Everyone jumped in and they were gone in a few minutes. I&#039;ll be making these again soon. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
440735,503895,2013/8/29,5,These were DIVINE! Sad to say but this was pretty much my dinner last night. The other sad thing is my DH and kids don&#039;t like pecans; these brownines will be all mine.  I used light brown sugar instead of dark which the recipe didn&#039;t suffer from it.  I am not a fan of Almond extract but you could not taste it.  This was very easy and yummy.  Made for ZWT9 for the Gourment Goddesses July 2013.
2209112,495222,2013/2/12,5,"Crunchy, cheesy.  What else can we ask for?"
2215432,495222,2013/2/12,5,Great recipe.  I love that you baked the spring rolls instead of frying them
2215434,495222,2013/2/12,5,"Cheese, spinach and potatoes. Great combination!"
2209765,495222,2013/2/14,0,I really liked the combination of the ranch seasoning and chili sauce with the greek yogurt
2209144,495222,2013/2/14,5,"So delicious, my teenagers loved these spring rolls !"
2209113,495222,2013/2/14,0,I was surprised how crunchy these spring rolls were!
2453327,495222,2013/2/17,5,It is well worthy those calories !
2454797,495222,2013/2/27,5,Great combination. It is crunchy and really tasty.
94226,493885,2013/2/10,3,"The eggplant was really nice in this, but I found it overall a bit bland. I pretty much followed the recipe, and finding it a bit lacking in flavour, doubled then tripled the spices. It still lacked something to me."
2001835916,532081,2018/6/1,0,"IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL, BUT DONT KNOW IF I WOULD PUT VINEGAR in with the rest of ingredients, but would add fresh basil and arugala."
174096,504643,2013/9/5,5,"Great salad!  Loved the color and crunch from all the veggies.  For the ingredients with options, I used brown sugar, hot sauce, and cilantro and did include the optional fish sauce.  Portion size was very generous - I look forward to the leftovers!  The one question I had was what size noodle to use - I ended up going with medium.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
2001172787,504643,2016/9/18,4,I really enjoyed this Salad! I did add mandarin oranges and pickled baby corn to my salad. It was filling and taste Great!
2123645,504643,2018/2/27,4,Lovely salad. I ended up doubling the dressing because there were just so many noodles. Really enjoyed the combination of veggies and flavors.
482376,496131,2013/8/22,5,"Ohhhhh so good. I loved the preserved lemon in this couscous. It was probably my favorite part. The blend of nuts, etc... were also really nice additions. I loved it all! Thank you. Made for the Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9"
383346,496131,2013/8/25,5,Me and DH liked this couscous a lot.  I didn&#039;t use the sultana because DH doesn&#039;t like that in his couscous.  It was great with toasted almonds.  Thanks kate :)  Made for ZWT9
169430,496131,2014/5/16,5,Very good indeed. I used whole wheat couscous and paired this with a Ras el Hanout seasoned pork chop along with some cooked chard. I love the versatility of couscous and this one was a real hit.
2001844921,533865,2017/12/8,0,my filling wouldn't thicken. how do I thicken it?
1553277,501937,2013/7/7,5,Easy to make with the three ingredients. Love it!
1625919,501937,2016/10/12,5,"This is a family favourite on holidays, but it's great any time of year. I like to add a bit of cayenne and pepper for flavour. Serve it with ketchup or sour cream for an extra little something!"
2001104202,504192,2017/7/10,5,Sooo amazing! Thank you!
220348,503391,2013/7/17,5,"This actually turned out to be much more creamy than the usual baba ganouj that I actually make. I also found that the Greek yogurt turned out very well. I used the three largest garlic cloves I could find, and enjoyed the flavour it added."
386585,503391,2013/9/3,4,"I must say, this was quite an interesting dip that is very unusual.  I made this exactly as posted, and enjoyed the smokiness of the eggplant and the garlic.  However, it was not as popular with others in my household, who felt the eggplant and yogurt was a strange combination.  While I thought it was unique, it was very tasty.  This does make a lot, however!  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
228458,503631,2013/7/15,5,"Despite a lengthy ingredient list, this comes together quickly and easily and was a great weeknight meal. I was a little bit short on bell pepper so I filled in with green beans...probably not conventional but worked for our pepper-phobic kids! I used brown rice I had already cooked so I added only two cups of broth. I also increased the black-eyed peas to bump up the protein a bit. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 9, for the Gourmet Goddesses."
2597942,503631,2013/7/16,5,"I made this for hubby and I. Personally, I like meat in mine, but for a vegan dish, this tasted delightful. I loved the added zucchini &amp; carrot (never tried that before in jambalaya). I halved the recipe since it was only the two of us. I didn&#039;t have the whole amount of the tomatoes to make half a batch, but that&#039;s okay because I don&#039;t care for them much,  (I picked around the few chunks in there anyway). Thank you for posting this recipe. (Made for ZWT9-Cajun Holy Trinity challenge)"
1287956,501602,2013/8/24,5,"Let me preface this by saying that my husband and I are chili-heads, so we can handle the heat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For starters, I used 10 ghost peppers instead of 15 jalapenos.  Ghost peppers are what jalepenos want to be when they grow up, so are considerably hotter.  I also cheated, and used baby carrots instead of taking the time to peel and cut up carrots.  That said, I followed the recipe to the letter, and it really didn&#039;t take that long to get everything done.  The long part was just waiting the week for the mixture to pickle, and was it worth it!!  The heat isn&#039;t that much because the oil tames it, but it has a wonderful flavor.  I&#039;m making burgers tonight, and can&#039;t wait to try the onions on the burgers!"
2000854766,534722,2018/4/12,5,"Very easy, very good and fluffy. Quick way to great biscuits."
169430,496376,2014/5/3,5,"This is surprisingly good. It real, honest to goodness, mac and cheese! I made it as lunch for DH yesterday and he felt that he had received a real treat. I can&#039;t disagree with him after taste testing for myself. Easy and delicious, without leftovers, what else could ask? Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
37449,496376,2014/5/9,5,Yum! I really enjoyed this for dinner tonight with a kale salad. It came together easily and was just the right amount. Thanks!
128473,496376,2014/5/9,5,"Thank you Annacia, you were so correct.  This is an awesome recipe, quick and easy to make with terrific results.  Beautiful creamy, cheesy macaroni, what a great comfort dish.  I made two; one for me and one for dh.  Even though he asked where the rest was, this was the perfect amount as a side to our meal. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. Made for Spring Pac 2014."
653438,496376,2014/5/10,5,"As the other reviewers said this is pure comfort food...so easy, creamy and great tasting.  Made for DH and one for me and we gobbled them down.  Definately going into my Favorites of 2014 and will be made often.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
1458727,496376,2014/5/13,5,"What a great recipe!  I tripled the recipe using 3/4 cup for the noodles, for the two of us.  We had just a little bit left over.  I will definitely make again."
145352,505601,2013/9/5,5,"This was good and quick. I served mine in large bowls with rice in the bottom. Maybe next time no rice. Also, I wouldn&#039;t let the noodles sit after removing from heat, as they were starting to get soggy. Made for ZWT 9!"
30534,497266,2013/4/10,5,Very good. I made the recipe as directed. The dish made a great dinner.
340141,502953,2013/9/17,4,Delicious!  I didn&#039;t use the full amount of celery and probably should have reduced the mayo by a couple tablespoons.     Nice combo of flavors and textures.  DH really liked it; went back for a large 2nd bowl.
239758,510215,2013/12/14,5,"I&#039;ve just spent 6 weeks in India and this recipe brings back some wonderful memories. The spice level is perfect and the dish is so easy to make. I wanted a slightly drier result, so used only 1 1/2 cups of water, and replaced the cayenne with two small chopped green chillies that needed to be used, but followed everything else. Will make and enjoy often. Thanks for posting."
498271,501331,2013/10/18,5,My goodness this is wonderful bread!  Nice firm crust and lovely soft and chewy inside.  Delicious and easy - really loved this - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for My3Chefs 2013
1800599522,501331,2013/12/10,5,Absolutely delicious. :-)
91584,501331,2014/3/31,5,"Wonderful texture and taste! Excellent, will be making again!"
2000907494,524149,2016/3/6,0,"Great recipe with a few changes. Cook carrots and cauliflower until soft (similar to when making mashed potatoes) before blending. Also, this desperately needs salt and a little sugar (my secret ingredient) to make it perfect. I mixed noodles and sauce then topped with a little extra cheese and baked in the oven until melty!"
266635,495250,2014/5/9,5,"Delish!  Loved these samosas - great ingredients and seasoning.  The only change I made was to combine everything together vs. layering them separately.  We also baked them and I loved the way the flour tortillas became nice and crispy with just a light brushing of olive oil.  Next time I might add a little curry powder to the seasoning.  Made for Spring PAC, May, 2014."
1803075803,518148,2014/8/27,5,These kabobs were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! !!
1803075870,518148,2014/8/27,5,Taste great!
1803077446,518148,2014/8/27,5,Straight wicked! Love it by the pound!
1803071639,518148,2014/9/11,5,"Awesome! So tender, melts in your mouth!"
2359243,518148,2014/9/11,5,So much flavor! People kept coming back for more and more!
1803126988,518148,2014/9/12,0,Very tasty Kabobs... The chicken was full of flavor and the sauce made this dish amazing!
280271,499214,2014/12/19,5,What superior flavors...my mouth was doing the happy dance..I cut the recipe in half and ate the whole thing...hubby was out with the guys..I can see serving this dish to company...there was plenty of liquid to serve it over rice...made for FTC tag game...=)
226863,499214,2015/1/14,5,"I served this with Naan bread, and it was delicious!  I don&#039;t think my sauce thickened up as much as Teresa&#039;s, but it was perfect for dunking the bread in.  Loved it!  Will make it often!!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for For Your Consideration Tag Game on Yuku!"
266635,499214,2015/1/30,5,This Indian-spiced shrimp is wonderful and so easy to put together. Wish I had made a double-batch. : )  I am so thankful that I have access to plenty of fresh wild-caught shrimp where I live as I will be making this dish often.  Served this dish with http://www.food.com/recipe/dal-nirvana-naan-493936 and a green salad. Made for the Best of 2014 tag game.
2002249194,520015,2018/8/16,0,Where would one find sozon
1803136297,517894,2014/9/15,5,"Love them!! and so do my guests, The only problem the first time I made them I didn&#039;t make enough. thank you for sharing"
128473,502323,2013/7/15,5,"These shrimps were excellent.  Perfectly grilled and very very tasty.  What a lovely spicy flavor they have.  Made exactly as written, wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  I served them inside of recipe #471567 along with green onions, romaine lettuce hearts, sliced mango, reserved marinade and cilantro.  Wow, what a great meal it was.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe, which I will make again."
2324285,509141,2014/1/22,4,"This was a nice salad- kind of like a Tabbouleh, but without the Bulgur wheat.  The pomegranate molasses really were the star flavor, I thought.  The mixture of greens was nice and really worked well with the light coating of dressing."
583193,501455,2014/4/14,5,"This was really good.  I omitted the nutmeg as I am not a big fan.  Also, the bacon didn&#039;t get very crispy so I would recommend putting the bacon in first and cooking it a bit before adding all the rest.  But very good flavor!"
2000431901,512242,2017/11/15,4,Good flavor!
2001066495,527396,2016/7/4,5,See u was right and I let my kids pick what they want on their taco. :)
204024,512242,2014/1/26,4,This has really good flavor but I think it would be better with a little oil or butter.  It is dry tasting.  Made for Name that Ingredient.
1436160,512242,2014/2/7,5,"I doubled the recipe and made it for our dinner for my 5:2 Fast day. The flavor was very tasty. I used a pound of chicken breast cutlets, panko breadcrumbs and shredded parmesan. The only  deviation I made was to spray the coated chicken with my olive oil mister. Thanks for a delicious dinner. I will definitely make this again."
2001282875,512242,2016/12/5,0,Made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious. Just added some breadcrumbs to the mix and a little paprika. Green means and mashed potatoes. He loved it and was looking for more.
204024,514822,2014/4/23,5,"Delicious, wonderful carnitas.   I will definitely be making this again.   Made for PAC Spring 2014."
67728,514822,2014/5/5,5,"So good! Not good for you, lol, but definitely worth the splurge now and then! DH was pouting yesterday when I was making this because he wanted fish for dinner, but as soon as I gave him a bit of the freshly crisped up meat, he totally forgot about the fish. We enjoyed this with warm corn tortillas, jalapenos en escabeche, cilantro and some homemade habanero salsa verde (oh, and fresh sliced radishes on the side, too). Definitely a winner, thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
2597942,511501,2014/1/21,5,"Basing my review on the sauce only, because I destroyed the biscuits. I will try &quot;baking&quot; these again (but I stink at it). Sauce is delicious, tho! Thanks for posting. Made for PRMR"
169430,513214,2014/5/2,3,"This is a quick fix dinner even with using fresh raw chicken breast instead of pre-packaged. I just used a fair dose of Recipe #515275 on the cubes before cooking. The end dish had good flavor but it was dry. We both would have preferred a cheese sauce to the cheese that partly melted and then became solid again. Sadly, I doubt that I&#039;ll be trying this one again. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
227978,504571,2013/8/3,5,"Oh my CaliforniaJan, but this is quite a tasty cocktail.  It&#039;s rather strong so I don&#039;t recommend it to those who prefer lighter cocktails.  But the cranberry juice adds a very nice touch against the Aquavit, and the lime juice provides a great citrus complement.  It&#039;s one of those unique cocktails that could be refreshing in summertime or warming in wintertime...a year-round treasure!  Made for ZWT #9 (Scandinavia)."
852554,504571,2013/8/4,5,"Delicious!  I had some all natural cranberry juice, so I just used a splash of that since fresh cranberries are hard to come by in August!  Made a second one (hic) with a bit of absolut vodka too.  Made for ZWT 9"
135470,504571,2013/8/11,5,"This was surprisingly tasty. I&#039;m not usually an aquavit fan but my DH likes it so we keep a bottle in the freezer. The herbs and spices in the aquavit  were  complemented by the cranberry and lime without being hidden. I did reduce the liquor by 2 TBLS so I could continue to function, and after tasting added a splash of 100% cranberry juice to go with the muddled berries which bumped it from 4 to 5 stars. Now when DH is quaffing straight aquavit I&#039;ll have an option to enjoy with him. Made for ZWT 9 Scandinavia by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers."
1800199313,509866,2014/1/24,5,"This was very good. I added corn to the meat/bean mixture. I also cooked the biscuits by itself for 15 minutes before adding the meat topping only because I have found in the past when I do a dish with adding biscuits on top or below, the biscuits never cook fully and it comes out doughy. Easy to make and everyone loved this dish!"
199848,501788,2013/7/15,5,I loved this.  I had nice yellow squash from my CSA box.  I probably used a little more squash than called for but I didn&#039;t have to adjust any other of the ingredients.  The goat cheese and dill flavors made this incredible and the texture was perfect; not dry and not too moist.  Loved this.  Thanx for posting it!
452355,501788,2013/7/18,5,"OMG!!!  This is soooo good!  DH went out tonight and I decided to make this for my dinner, whereas if it was both of us eating it would have had to be lunch/brunch.  This is a definite keeper.  So easy to make, I used squash purchased at the farmers market today.  Realized I was out of butter while making and substituted Earth Balance buttery sticks.  Worked fine.  LOVED the dill, which I used from my garden.  I don&#039;t think I&#039;d use another herb. So glad I stumbled upon this in your recipes, Mikekey!  Thanks!  Made for Veggie Swap July 2013."
1802604772,507930,2014/3/31,0,Thank you so much for posting this. My dh had these from Denny&#039;s and is now an addict. I will attempt to make these tonight.
2201427,518229,2014/8/25,5,Oh wow!!  This is my kind of breakfast ........  so many wonderful flavors!!!
2200921,518229,2014/8/26,5,Delicious recipe
914360,518229,2014/8/26,0,Five stars !  This would start any day off right !
2192609,518229,2014/8/26,5,"Another delicious recipe--healthy, easy and fabulous!!!"
510096,518229,2014/8/26,5,Sounds like an A1 breakfast! Delicious!
2206691,518229,2014/8/26,5,absolutely awesome recipe!
2423055,518229,2014/8/26,5,My family will love these!  Yummy and perfect for breakfast on the go!!
2198132,518229,2014/8/26,5,"Yum, these look mighty tasty!"
1772643,518229,2014/8/26,5,A wrap never looked so good!!
2189849,518229,2014/8/26,5,That would be a nice way to wake up! So pretty!
2209000,518229,2014/8/26,5,Wow that looks great for breakfast!
1802651220,518229,2014/8/27,5,Love breakfast wraps and this one has all the flavors I crave!
2667767,518229,2014/8/27,5,Steak. A1. Match made in heaven.
2651564,518229,2014/8/29,5,Wonderful breakfast recipe! Great for on the go!
2200124,518229,2014/8/29,5,That is a great idea and makes for one delicious breakfast!
2204786,518229,2014/8/30,5,You always hit homeruns! Love this!
266635,513486,2014/3/28,5,"Made this yummy oatmeal for breakfast today -- DH made a happy plate (bowl). : ) Have to say that I am not overly fond of oatmeal, but it was quite good with the addition of the pumpkin and spices.  I scaled the recipe back to two servings, omitted the cinnamon and only used the pumpkin pie spice along with brown sugar.  Next time I will use truvia in place of the sugar.  Made for PRMR, March, 2014."
1072593,513486,2015/4/11,5,"SOOOO GOOD!  I&#039;m thinking there&#039;s some kind of scientific connection...full head hair growth, whiter teeth, weight loss...  See you at breakfast!"
2891708,502197,2013/7/6,5,This recipe is terrific!!!! My kids love it and I have made it 3 times in 3 weeks.  Soo easy! My girls want to try topping with chocolate covered strawberries tonight.  Great dessert for parties - loved by parents and kids alike!!!!
1800349537,502197,2013/11/28,5,"This stuff is wonderful! Not too involved for a nice weekend dessert, but good enough for a holiday desert too. My only suggestion, I used double stuff cookies because it&#039;s what I had on hand, and it made the crushing a mess (I don&#039;t have a processor). Otherwise, two thumbs up!"
829250,502197,2015/1/2,4,Good stuff! Could of done without the chocolate chips on top though. Not to rich!!!
2000166234,502197,2015/4/26,5,"Love this dessert. I used crushed oreos for the topping vs. the chocolate chips. Also, I crushed the oreos in a large bagggie with a rolling pin. If you use a processor it makes the dessert very crumbed. It&#039;s is much tastier with larger chuncks of oreo."
2000223253,502197,2015/5/24,5,"This is the second time I&#039;ve made this dessert in a week.  It fed all of my coworkers for a staff potluck, and I&#039;m bringing it to a 3 family gathering for Memorial day.  It is easy, DELICIOUS, and did I mention easy and delicious?  Not too rich, but just the right amount of sweetness.  Didn&#039;t change a thing about the recipe.  Woo-hoo!"
920589,502197,2015/6/11,3,Yummy but not easy or fast.
1378968,502197,2015/6/28,5,"My husband&#039;s co-worker brought this to work and hubby was hooked. I had him ask for the recipe and he brought home this print out from food.com. He now requests it for birthdays, Father&#039;s Day, etc. It seemed like a lot of steps the first time, but the second time I made it, it came together more quickly. With 4 small children I tend to go for easy recipes, so this is still reserved for special occasions because of the multiple steps, but it is SO good. I have been tempted to mix all the layered ingredients together and just sprinkle crushed Oreos on top, but I don&#039;t think it would taste as good -- I think the layers really make it."
2000703652,502197,2015/11/23,5,"OMG! I made this recipe for a &quot;Friendsgiving&quot; Party and everyone said it was wonderful! And addictive. Of all the desserts brought, this was the only one that totally disappeared! It was easy to put together without ANY baking!"
2000770105,502197,2015/12/24,5,I make this a lot but I make my bottom a layer of brownies and then do the other steps!! It&#039;s amazing
2000964698,502197,2016/4/9,4,"Not too difficult, but you&#039;ll be washing a lot of spatulas. :) Next time I make this, I will increase the cream cheese layer by 50%. 

Word to the wise: make sure to warm cream cheese to room temp or the mixture will be a little lumpy."
2001003885,502197,2016/5/8,5,"This dessert is absolutely amazing! I just made it and it's in the refrigerator for tomorrow! The only thing I would change is when you combine the pudding in a bowl do ONE pack at a time and split the 3 and 1/4 cups of milk between each pudding pack. If you mix both packs plus all the milk at once the pudding becomes VERY clumpy and it's extremely hard to get rid of it all. I made the first pack then poured it over the dish then mixed the next pack and did the same thing, SO MUCH EASIER!! Also make sure you let your cool whip sit out and soften a tad bit so it's easy to spread! Everyone has to try this dessert at least once!! :-)"
2001099160,502197,2016/7/23,5,A coworker brought this in for a potluck and it was amazing! I have made it twice since then and everyone loves it. I made it over the July 4th holiday for a family get together and it disappeared very quickly! It is a little time consuming but with every minute you spend making it!
2001113812,502197,2016/8/3,0,I have not made this recipe but do make a similar one - I use 1 box of instant chocolate and 1 box of instant butterscotch pudding - I do mix them together before adding the milk with 1/2 cup of icing powder and have never had a problem with lumps...
2001258076,502197,2016/11/21,0,Is there a way to make this using real whipped cream? I do not like the ingredients in Cool Whip.
2001260520,502197,2016/11/22,0,"I made this, but with a twist. I made Mint Chocolate Lasagna by using Mint flavored oreos and Andy's mints crushed and sprinkled on top. Everything else was the same as not to over power the mintyness."
2001369324,502197,2017/2/4,5,"I have been making a similar ''pie'' for almost 40 years. It was on a tv news segment in Charlotte,NC called Oreo pie. Our family is addicted. My recipe calls for alittle more butter in the crust, no sugar or milk in the cream cheese and only one package of pudding and of corse less milk. I have made many differant variations over the years, favorite one seemed to be putting a second layer of vanilla pudding mixed with some peanut butter. Most holidays I would be making atleast four of them for gatherings."
2001390897,502197,2017/2/13,0,I added strawberries on top of cream cheese layer. So good! Adds some fresh and tartness to balance it out! Yummy either way!
435019,502197,2017/2/19,5,We loved this dessert! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Thank you for posting this great recipe.
2001451670,502197,2017/4/3,5,"This is Fantastic...Everyone loves it, will make again"
2001524114,502197,2017/5/6,5,"Love this recipe! My second time making it for a party, it's a big hit! It's now my GO TO for desserts :)"
2001532298,502197,2017/5/11,5,"So, I used golden oreos and banana cream pudding instead of chocolate. Also used crushed golden oreos as the topping. Everybody loved it!!! Most said they liked it better than the chocolate. :)"
2001598026,502197,2017/6/24,5,I cook for many different people and so far have made this dessert for two different groups. Both groups loved this dessert. I already have another request to make it for a potluck.
2001670547,502197,2017/8/13,5,Instead of mixing the pudding in a bowl I followed the back of the box
2001710204,502197,2017/9/11,0,"A girl made this for a work party on time. Since work was shut down today, due to the storm surges from Irma, I decided to give it a go. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out just like the one at the party. The only thing I will do different next time is probably use more cookies to make more of a crust. Either that, or just have a box graham crackers on hand to make more of a dip."
2001716807,502197,2017/9/16,5,The worst part of this dessert is every bowl/dish/spatula is dirty. I AM NO COOK/BAKER( ask my family) but this dessert makes me an expert!! Best part is the variations you can create. Made this many times and I always get raves. You must try!!!
2002059426,502197,2018/3/18,4,"The recipe was very clear and easy to follow. My husband and I loved it and the people we had over wanted the recipe! It was delicious! The only change I made was to have each layer use a full 8oz. container of Cool Whip, rather than 6oz. for the cream cheese layer and 6oz. for the topping. It worked well and made the layers nice and thick. However I did find that making the crust took forever! I have often made a crumb crust using a rolling pin and the cookies in a Ziplock bag with no difficulty. This time much of the Oreo cookie mixture kept sticking to the inside of the Ziplock bag. I had to do it with 6 cookies at a time so that I could keep scraping the crumbs off the inside of the Ziplock bag. Other than it taking quite a bit longer to assemble than I expected this is an excellent recipe and a wonderful dessert!"
2002206773,502197,2018/7/3,5,I make this for every family gathering! Everyone loves it so much!
2002251155,502197,2018/8/18,0,"I mix the cool whip into the chocolate pudding for my goddaughters, but I always mix it into the cream cheese layer for everyone else. A favorite dessert for everyone!"
2002356120,502197,2018/12/4,5,This was a big hit for our office potluck luncheon! I even noticed folks eating it for breakfast the day after! Quick and easy to make - thanks for a new favorite!
690623,527687,2016/8/17,5,I can't believe I have never grilled a peach before. I was missing so much! I don't even like yoghurt but loved it on these peaches. Thanks for posting! K9 Owned/Lesley
314579,527687,2016/8/18,5,"Sooooo good. I found authentic greek yogurt, amazing. Don't skip the cinnamon, it really enhanced the peach flavor. I don't think my grill was quite hot enough, so I ended up grilling for 10 minutes, and could have gone another 5. This was really amazing and couldn't be much easier. Thanks for posting will certainly be making again! Stacy G made for CG 2016, Greece."
1680722,527687,2016/8/18,5,"Super easy and so good! I prepared this with autentic Greek yogurt, Greek peaches and Greek honey! I grilled the peaches on charcoals (after cleaning the grid). WONDERFUL result and great surprise for my familt! Made for &quot;grill it up - Greek style&quot; event."
1695033,516447,2015/10/19,5,These are delicious!  Moist and cake-like.  I sprinkled cinnamon-sugar topping on before baking.
724631,513433,2014/4/8,5,"Ultimate fried chicken!  A labor of love, but the intense flavoring from the herbs during par-baking, combined with the buttermilk-hot sauce marinade, the flour-garlic-onion coating, and the garlic-herb infused cooking oil made a perfect thin-crusted chicken.  Tossing the garlic and herbs in the oil while it heated up ensured that the oil reached a high enough temperature for non-soggy frying.  This was quite a production, but if I had baked the chicken all the way instead of frying, the chicken would have been soggier.  If you want to impress someone that you make the world&#039;s best fried chicken, you must try this recipe!  Served with Recipe #456438. Made for Rookie Recipe Tag."
2000157543,537037,2018/10/18,0,"May I have a copy of the recipe. Thank you, Coll"
2324285,494118,2013/2/3,5,"Great recipe!  I love the idea of mixing shredded cheese with chopped green chilies and then melting it on the patty.  The shredded zuchinni also made the burgers super-moist and HUGE.  I do tend to like really thin patties for my burgers, but this was a nice change of pace.  I topped these with tomato, green onions, and sliced serrano peppers, but I'd love to try pico de gallo on these in the future.  It would taste great alongside the strong cumin flavor of the meat. [made and reviewed for Please Review My Recipe]"
212609,494118,2013/4/7,5,"I detest zucchini as a vegetable...but I think it really comes into it&#039;s own grated and cooked amongst other ingredients, and this recipe shows just how well this works!!&lt;br/&gt;DH and I really enjoyed these...especially the cheese/chilli topping, which really sets it off beautifully....with DH even commenting that the topping totally made turkey burgers acceptable..and that&#039;s high praise!&lt;br/&gt;The 6 and 8 year old ate the patties on their own, and enjoyed them too...so a good way of sneaking veggies into their diet that they wouldn&#039;t normally eat!&lt;br/&gt;Great recipe Ellie....thank you.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
1803602387,501045,2015/5/31,2,"The measurements on this recipe are EXTRAORDINARILY off!!!!  My first 3 tries with this recipe were all lumpy disgusting disasters.  1 tablespoon of butter to 4 tablespoons (4 Tbs = 1/4 cup) of flour didn&#039;t seem to work no matter how slowly I incorporated the flour.  In the end, I went with what I know - building a cream sauce requires a roux. A roux is made with equal parts flour and butter (fat).  I melted 2 tbs butter and combined it with 2 tbs flour.  Once the flour had been cooked for couple of minutes, I SLOWLY added my warmed milk (after measuring the first cup, I just kind of winged the rest of the measurements by adding more until it was a consistency that made me happy).  I also added garlic powder for added seasoning oomph with the S &amp; P before incorporating the crab and some shrimp.  I give it 2 stars because the creation I came up with inspired by this recipe was wonderful."
2001273667,501045,2016/11/28,5,Great recipe Simone!
2001969762,501045,2018/2/3,0,"Very good, did have to change it up just a bit due to thickness. All in all though very good!!d"
242766,517665,2014/8/16,5,"Delicious!  We really loved these lightly lemony cornbread muffins.  The lemon flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  They are not too sweet, but sweet enough.  The cheddar cheese added a slight saltiness that was very pleasing. The only thing I did differently was to use lemon Greek yogurt instead of plain.  I think this helped boost the yummy lemon flavor.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper! **Made for Culinary Quest Express Round #1 - Suitcase Gourmets**"
314579,517665,2014/8/16,0,"These were yummy!!  I made 1/2 a batch just as directed and the other half, I must admit I changed a bit.  There&#039;s only 2 of us in the house and I decided to make half &quot;savory&quot; and the other sweet.  I usually don&#039;t post about significant changes I make, but the base recipe is soooo good, I can&#039;t help it.  The original recipe is great and I like Bayhills review!  For the &quot;sweet&quot; half, I just left the cheddar out and added fresh blueberries and topped with some chopped candied ginger.  They were amazing.  I got a full 16 muffins and for the two of us, I loved having one recipe I could use in two ways!!  Thanks Ev!  Made for Culinary Quest Express Round #1 - Int&#039;l Agents of QUEST!"
305531,527483,2016/7/18,5,Great dish with wonderful flavors. I did have to cook my chicken quarters a little longer but that may have been because they were so big. This was a hit at my house. Thanks for sharing. Made for CQ3 - Philippines.
502302,493701,2013/1/25,4,"At least once a week I slow cook the dinner and once a week we are doing ""meatless"" meals so this was a good new recipe to find. I was a little unclear how to serve it though... it was more of a skillet meal with the rice stirred in and beef picadillo would be served with tortillas and sides. I didn't have any tortillas on hand and we were in a hurry so I think I served it as a one pot meal.<br/>I did have to make some substitutions due to what I had on hand. No green chiles and just a small amount of sweet pepper so I also added some carrots in step 1. I added some jalepeno tabasco sauce but never did quite make it to ""spicy"". That was for the best though since my family has a low spice tolerance! My apples were on the small side so I added 2 and didn't regret it. I used chicken stock and brown rice. The black olives and raisins were omitted. Hubby said he would like the olives and I was thinking of only adding the raisins next time. Rather than black olives, I think green ones or some capers would be a nice touch. The almonds do add to the dish but I think I may sprinkle them on top of each serving. DD doesn't like them."
804550,496237,2014/5/4,5,"This soup is delicious! The flavors together created the perfect soup. I used red potatoes and I opted not to peel them. The cheese I used was aged reserve extra sharp cheese. Plus I added some seasoned salt, but otherwise made as written. My soup didn&#039;t thicken that much but that was perfectly fine with me. Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
1052873,513068,2014/4/5,4,"The brownie part was really good, but I think next time, I&#039;ll add some powdered sugar to the peanut butter swirls. The peanut butter flavor was overpowering."
895132,505161,2014/5/14,5,"These were an unexpectedly big hit in household of meat eaters :) I used gluten free bread crumbs and celeriac because I forgot to purchase celery stalks. And I wasn&#039;t sure if roasted red pepper meant pepper from a jar or freshly roasted pepper, so I went with a freshly oven roasted red pepper, and it turned out great. Originally I planned on serving these with cashew gravy but decided for tomato-vegetable sauce. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
80353,504238,2013/8/29,4,"I think the &#039;key&#039; ingredient in this recipe is the oil (I used evoo), even though it may not look that way initially.  It is the oil that emulsifies this into a sauce and tones down the strong flavours of the mustard, dill and vinegar.  The touch of sweetness was very nice.  Served over baked salmon."
2549237,502869,2013/7/17,4,"This recipe was great.  I did make a few changes, not to ingredients, but to the technique of cooking this.  First off, I left the bones in the chicken thighs.  Second, I didn&#039;t blanch the tomatoes.  And third,  I left the skins on the potatoes and cubed them before I placed them in a Betty Crocker Roaster.  I roasted these for 6 hours and they were just amazing.  We really enjoyed the taste and the roaster prevented us from dying from heat exhaustion today. It was 95 and very humid and we don&#039;t have AC.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe that I am sure to make often!  Made for team Tasty Testers for Greece in ZWT9."
2002190486,535300,2018/6/18,5,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!
381180,512375,2014/4/20,5,"I loved this!  Somehow my parsley didn&#039;t make it home with me from the grocery, so I added fresh cilantro instead.  I also added one tablespoon lemon juice and one tablespoon melted butter to the bread mixture.  My salmon was sort of thin and it was done in exactly 10 minutes.  Tagged for Spring PAC 2014, and placed into my Best of 2014 cookbook!"
239758,505674,2016/8/8,5,"I made half a batch of this yummy and easy-to-make version of sticky rice. Due to operator error (I was a bit heavy-handed with the soy and fish sauce), the final result was a tad too salty for my tastes, although my husband thought it was perfect as is. So advice to the heavy-handed. Go easy on the salty ingredients. In other words, follow the recipe!"
1269180,498834,2013/9/5,4,"Turned out a bit &quot;bready&quot; - crust outside, and tasty but not quite the consistency/texture I was expecting. I wonder maybe whether it requires self-raising flour rather than plain-flour?"
1800060921,498834,2013/9/15,1,I think the measurements are wrong. My dough turned really thick. I was unable to go any further and had to throw it all out. It&#039;s consistency was that of bread dough. It was a waste of time and effort.
37449,507317,2013/11/3,5,"Quartered the recipe just for me, used nice and thick almond milk instead of cream and used whole grain bread. I loved the subtle taste of orange. I haven&#039;t had french toast for ages, so this was a nice treat! Thanks!"
128473,507317,2013/12/2,5,"Wow, wow, wow. Chef GRPA this is my new favorite french toast, kudos to you.  Was this ever flavorful, quick and really easy to make with ingredients always on hand. I loved it, orange, cinnamon and cream, can you say :yummy:  I had no problem shaping the star, it was very easy.  Make sure to cook on lower heat and watch carefully, because it will burn quickly.  I will be making this again tomorrow, but I will be using my favorite chinese egg coconut bread, I can&#039;t wait, I have a feeling that it will be over the top good.  Thank you so much for sharing."
128473,493556,2013/4/16,5,"Mmmm, is this homemade lemonade ever good.  I am really enjoying this flavorful treat, you can taste the lemon and the strawberries.  I has a lovely velvety texture.  Thank you so much for sharing your dad&#039;s recipe.  I will be making this often.  Made for Pac Spring Safari 2013."
2549237,495411,2014/3/3,5,This is magnificent!  It was super easy and resulted in a very moist and succulent pork chop.  I brined my pork chops for about 5 hours and followed the rest of the directions precisely.  The sauce that was made reminded me of a honey mustard type sauce and was very delicious.  Thank you for the great recipe Forevermama!  Made for PRMR.
187373,495411,2015/7/9,4,"I enjoyed this, but wish I would&#039;ve had more time for it to brine. Only had about 3 hours before I had to cook it.  Next time, would leave it overnight or at least most of the day. But both the little boys enjoyed it as did I."
2848132,498739,2013/6/2,1,"After seeing this recipe shared by everyone on Facebook, I was hoping there was some baking magic that would make this odd list of ingredients into a cookie.  I excitedly added the ingredients to my shopping list. With a smile of anticipation I mixed up the simple recipe.  I could barely wait for them to cool before chomping into one.  Sadly, no, these taste exactly like you think they would.  Gummy and bland.  They&#039;re not terrible, but two 5 year olds just told me, &quot;No, thank you&quot; when I offered them &quot;cookies&quot;."
2902417,498739,2013/7/15,1,#1 Almond milk is far from sugar free. #2 they are very bland and disappointing.
1927342,498739,2013/9/16,3,I had some bananas I needed to use so I made these. Trying to find healthy things for the kids. I would think throwing in an egg and baking powder wouldn&#039;t hurt next time. Good for kids running out the door rushing in the morning. More like a soft granola breakfast bar consistency than a cookie.
367392,525071,2015/12/15,5,Followed recipe exactly as written... we all LOVED it. Thanks for sharing will be making again and again
2690033,494991,2013/2/12,5,"I absolutely loved the flavor and texture this burger has. 
My family appreciated them and I didnt miss eating the bun the burger was so delicious alone."
2717569,494991,2013/3/1,0,This was delicious! My family and I really enjoyed our meal. I would recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone! :)
2000261250,516984,2015/6/10,5,Delicious. Thank you for sharing.
2001237068,516984,2017/12/20,5,"Tortillas were a hit. I used a corn tortilla press to flatten the balls into rounds. Made rolling them easier and more round. Got eight 10- to 12-inch tortillas. Was cautious at first rolling them out, but was able to get them nice and thin. Instead of kneading for 10-15 minutes (out of sourdough experience having broken the glutens with hard bran) I mixed in the liquid kneading only until combined, let it sit for 15 minutes to soften the bran and then kneaded more thoroughly. No idea if it makes a difference, but thought I'd share the changed step."
2001617354,523151,2018/5/7,0,It would be a better mix if it was made without sugar. Sugar detracts from the taste of the taco cornbread.
1925885,503965,2013/7/18,5,"Yum!  The Angostura bitters (Peychauds, of course!) are what make the drink. DH says to make sure and state that this is a &quot;chick drink&quot;!  Being a chick, I will definitely make this again!  ZWT9."
2000431004,497640,2015/8/26,5,This marinade was so good. One of the best I have ever tried.  I got and encore on this one.  I didn&#039;t have any honey and I used dried herbs instead of fresh and it still came out delicious.  Will do again.
2001192615,497640,2016/10/3,5,"WOW. This is good stuff. I used a red Zinfandel instead because that's all we had around the house, and it was amazing. Great flavor. Caramelizes well too."
695933,510715,2013/12/11,5,"A beautiful menu for a winter night. I made the chicken and the leftover in a chicken salad this weekend (with my own mashed potato recipe) - both turned out perfectly! Nothing beats the veggies that roast and caramelize under the chicken.The chicken is perfectly flavored and moist. Your Creatively reimagined, roast chicken can lead to great things. Try it in casseroles, chicken salads. The chicken turned out wonderfully. I do have a few pointers for any novices out there are old and forget thing like me - I definitely make a Maple herb butter the night before to make the next day that much easier, &quot;marjoram&quot; is a plant and I went to the grocery store and found it in the spices and used that (it worked great). Also, when you first place the chicken in the oven on 375 for 30 minutes, make sure to keep an eye on it. The baste cooked very quickly on top of the skin and burnt, I just wasn&#039;t paying attention. It didn&#039;t matter at all since you cut the skin off before you serve it anyway, but if you are concerned about presentation then keep an eye on it. I do HIGHLY recommend using the gravy recipe included, the flavor was incredible and tastes great on the leftover sandwiches as a spread!! The entire process was pretty simple and easy to follow, and the end result was that I may be doing this for the Holidays. I&#039;ll be making this again and again. This will be one of my go to recipe! PRMR 2013 Happy Cooking to y&#039;all!..Thank You!..Grpa  I am Glad you posted the recipe."
1680722,510715,2014/3/6,5,"Yummy! I loved the lemon, thyme and honey combination.&lt;br/&gt;I loved the your tip to push the spice mixture under the skin, as baking the skin puffed a little bit and became crunchy.&lt;br/&gt;I placed the chicken on a bed of vegetables (sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots and red bell peppers) as the other reviewer suggested and a got a really great and complete dish.&lt;br/&gt;My chicken was not as big and for this reason the cooing time was not as long.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks  a lot for your suggestion and great recipe."
128473,501152,2013/6/22,5,"I really enjoyed this exotic tasting treat. It was quick and easy to make with a great punch of flavor. I loved that all the ingredients worked well together and that you could taste them all.  We thought that the asparagus and olives worked really well together in this dish.  A few small changes, diced tomatoes instead of sun dried, didn&#039;t have any and I freshly ground the  chinese five spice powder, for a beautiful mellow note. This was one of my personal favorite dishes, Good Luck in the Contest."
226863,501152,2013/6/23,5,"What a fun combination of flavors!  I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had black olives with asparagus together in a dish, and combining it with the five spice....what a flavor explosion.  I enjoyed this very much, and its quick to make as a bonus.  Thanks for sharing!"
400708,532179,2018/11/22,4,"I followed the directions exactly or at least I think I did. The crust was to thick and I'm sure that's my issue as I'm not the best at pastries. They do have a wonderful flavor of pecans, but thinking next time I'd reduce the pecans to about 3/4 pound as it was so full of pecans I had trouble even mixing and the finished product was to heavy in pecans for what I was expecting. Other than that, great flavor and was enjoyed."
2399085,504056,2013/7/19,5,"Made for PRMR! After looking at the ingredients, um usually I do not put cinnamon on chicken. It actually gives it  bold flavor and not a cinnamon taste! Thanks for the recipe..."
266635,504056,2014/9/5,5,"We really enjoyed this grilled chicken -- love the freshness of the lemon and the cinnamon really adds a great flavor.  So easy to make -- served with rice and a side salad. Will definitely make this grilled chicken again.  Made for the &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; tag game, September, 2014."
169430,504056,2017/3/24,5,"I made this amazing recipe last evening and am already planing another appearance. Super health properties and simply marvelous taste. Love, love! the cinnamon. I wouldn't change a single thing (and that's saying something for me). Very high on the healthy list with taste that will bring you back time and again. Also, super simple marinating and quick grill time make this something that would be perfect for get together for a bigger crowd ."
128473,517500,2014/8/7,5,"Delicious, love mango and lime,  loved this drink.  Icy cold and perfect for this warm afternoon.  Quick and easy to make with great flavor and texture.  Beautiful color also, very pretty.  Made for Culinary Quest - Russia."
314579,517500,2014/8/8,4,"Enjoyed this vey much on a hot summer day.  What I liked about this is that while it is a blended fruity drink, it&#039;s not overly sweet, a good mix between a mixed and blended cocktail.  Thanks so much for posting!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014!"
305531,499525,2014/5/18,5,Nice tartar sauce. I did add some sweet relish too. This was great to dip fries into. Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
179133,499525,2014/5/22,5,This was great with fish &amp; chips. I used red onion and some of last year&#039;s homemade dill pickles (&amp; juice). No sweet relish for me (ewww! lol) Thanks for sharing! [Made for Spring 2014 Pick a Chef]
131126,499525,2014/5/24,5,"Comfort classic.  Tart, tangy, and paired nicely with baked fish sticks. Made for Spring 2014 Pick a Chef."
1500065,499525,2015/4/7,5,Made this on a whim tonight (as I&#039;m not a fan of tarter sauce and have never made it before) since my husband and kids like tarter sauce and I was making homemade healthier fish sticks so I thought this might make them go down easier. ;).  They raced about it and were not happy that I had halved the recipe!  (Couldn&#039;t see wasting a whole cup of mayo if they didn&#039;t like it.)  fish sticks came out great (used brown rice krisp cereal as coating) and tarter sauce was a huge hit!  Since I was making it last minute I didn&#039;t let it sit for an hour and I used a little dried minced onion since I didn&#039;t have fresh ready to go.  Chopped up a dill pickle and viola!  Thanks!
2001060825,499525,2016/6/24,5,I was in the same predicament as the first reviewer and made the same adjustments. It was great! Much better than the bottled crap!
2658671,493707,2013/1/26,0,"Liked the recipe. I added some sweet pepper , because I like it. Overall a good and easy to prepare dish that I would recommend."
37449,510364,2014/3/24,5,"I love to try different deviled eggs and this was nice and different, using horseradish. Thanks!"
226867,507094,2013/10/24,3,"This was good, but kind of boring. It needed some fruit (chopped apples? raisins?) and/or some nuts to make it less one-dimensional. Flavor was ok, especially where the cinnamon was heaviest."
2702088,495296,2013/2/24,5,Wonderful - love the pepper with ranch flavor~!
2708967,495296,2013/2/24,5,The avocado-ranch sauce makes this dish!!!  Wonderful!!
266635,495296,2014/4/18,5,"This is a great stuffed poblano dish and the sauce is delish!  Made a directed except that I used ground round vs. pork.  We make stuffed poblanos all the time and this recipe will be part of our regular line-up.  Made for Spring PAC, April, 2014."
2399085,504158,2013/7/24,5,Made for PRMR! The thing I really liked about this as was the flavor was great. Sweet but not too sweet and the heat was not overpowering. 2 things that I didn&#039;t like was the amount of ingredients and too spicy for my kids. But overall awesome for us GROWNUPS!!
2001244894,519547,2016/11/13,4,"These were pretty darn good, if you are on a grain free, coconut free, dairy free (that's a lot of Free' s I know hahaha) diet. Do not expect them to be like regular chocolate chip cookies, and they aren't very sweet but they definitely hit the spot for a cookie craving and I noticed after I ate them I felt satisfied :-) me which is a good thing because I usually end up eating the whole batch within an hour :-) Thank you for sharing the recipe!!"
2001312159,519547,2016/12/22,2,I tried to make a batch of these as a Christmas treat for a diabetic friend. They were awful. The stevia has a very nasty after taste that sticks around in your mouth. It was a waste of time and good ingredients. I hope the squirrels will eat theem
2001333213,519547,2017/1/2,5,"I've wanted gluten-free pfferneuse cookies for a while, so I used this as a base and added: pinch of black pepper, 1 Tablespoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon cardamon, 1/2 teaspoon ginger (might add less next time), 1 teaspoon nutmeg, pinch cloves. They are yummy!"
2002139960,519547,2018/5/3,0,Does anyone know the Nutritional facts for the Almond Flour Stevia Cookies? Per cookie if possible.
2002350586,519547,2018/11/28,2,"I made these today, they smelled incredible, texture was fantastic BUT they were not sweet enough at all.. the flavor of the almond and butter overpowered the sweet aspect and they tasted bitter almost. I would suggest adding more stevia and possibly chocolate chips or spices to mask that weird bitter taste."
171790,503786,2013/7/20,5,I could live on this salad. It&#039;s that good. I  reduced it to one serving since I was dining alone tonight. It made a very generously sized single salad. The grilled pita is a nice addition. Made for ZWT9
400708,510760,2013/12/17,5,"Made this for PRMR Game and a great choice.  I wanted something that I could freeze and have ready for when Christmas company starts arriving as we don&#039;t know what time they&#039;ll get here.  This fit the bill.  It made a lot so we had it for dinner last night to try and all I can say is GREAT, I&#039;ll be proud to serve this to company.  The Italian Sausage I got was already ground (like hamburger) and that made it a little easier, just cooked it with the ground round.  Also added some fennel seeds as DH loves those in his Italian meals.  Other than that made as directed.  This is a true keeper"
226863,510760,2013/12/31,5,"I halved the recipe and we loved the sliced italian sausage mixed in with the ground meat.  I had to add some finely chopped garlic with the onions.  I really enjoyed this dish, and my son is now on &quot;thirds&quot;.  I took a shortcut and just added the sauce and tomato paste into the meat mixture, added the additional seasonings, stirred in the pasta and cheese, and saved the clean up of the extra bowl.  (I&#039;m all for less clean up!). Worked perfectly.  Made this easy to make and it turned out delicious.  Made for your win in Football tag!  Congratulations!"
242766,510760,2014/1/4,5,"We loved this flavorful Italian pasta dish!  I loved the fact that it could be made ahead and frozen for those times when I need to get a quick meal on the table.  For our tastes, I used 2 tsp. garlic salt and 1 TBSP Italian seasoning.  I also added some fresh ground black pepper.  I saved a couple of steps and added the noodles and cheese to the sauce in the pan.  I mixed it together well and put it in the baking pan.  I baked it for about 30 minutes and then added the additional cheese on top.  I baked it for the addtional 15 minutes. I baked this in a 9&quot; x 13&quot; baking pan and froze the rest in a 9-1/2&quot; x 9-1/2&quot; deep disposable, aluminum pan to use at a later time.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  **Made for 2013 Football Pool**"
212609,510760,2014/3/9,5,"Yummy yummy  yummy .........this dish was a big hit, even with seven and nine year old peskies, who are particular about their pasta!&lt;br/&gt;I took tips from previous reviews and saved on cleaning up, by mixing the sauces, cheese and pasta together with meat in the pan....a good move!&lt;br/&gt;Leftovers are just as tasty.....and I still have some stashed in the freezer, for when I need a good meal on the table fast.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for a top notch recipe Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
653438,510760,2014/4/23,5,"My oh my!!!  This dish is sooooo good!!!  I cut the recipe in half.  I did add some garlic with the onions and like everyone saved a step and mixed the sauces, meat, seasoning and  the cheese all together and put it in two small pans.   Then I topped both casseroles with a little more cheese.  I froze one for another night and DH and I still had plenty.  Served with garlic bread and a fresh green salad.  Thank you for posting and this is going into my Favorites of 2014.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
2000434134,510760,2015/8/27,5,"DELICIOUS!!!! I don&#039;t typically write recipe reviews because typically I am disappointed. I feel as though no one else has similar taste buds to mine. Dishes that are rated high usually are terrible and bland! NOT THIS RECIPE!!!! Some friends were in Chicago and brought home some Italian beef from Portillo&#039;s. Being in charge of a side dish, I looked at their menu and this is what matches! I have never even heard of this stuff. Skeptical, I made it. (I used spicy Italian sausage links...I like heat). I brought it to the party and even the mid-westerners were blown away. Anyway, MAKE THIS DISH. This will be going into our winter rotation with a nice big salad. Yummmeroo. My mouth is watering jus thinking about this recipe."
2000645147,510760,2015/11/6,5,I have never commented on a Recipe before but this came out FANTASTIC..definitely a keeper.only change I made was using Rigatoni shaped pasta
2001002722,510760,2016/5/8,5,"This is the best!!! Served it last night, and it was a hit! This will be my go to receipe for mostaccioli for sure A++++"
895132,512529,2014/3/3,5,"Delicious! I cheated a bit and used cubed boneless skinless chicken breasts, so the cooking time was less. But otherwise didn&#039;t change a thing, and we loved it. Perfect mix of spices! Thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for A Culinary tour of YEMEN! / N*A*M*E forum"
1802005284,512678,2014/3/5,5,These are so delicious!!  Pressed one in a grilled Ciabatta sandwich with a little marinara and mayo.....oh my!  The sandwich idea is a must try!!!
169430,506199,2013/9/26,5,"I love this recipe! I made the full amount of the base recipe. Divided that into quarter amounts and then added a different flavor to each. I made: Chocolate Chunk Mini Cheesecake, Peanut Butter Mini Cheesecake, Citrus Mini Cheesecake and Mocha Mini Cheesecake. I only sampled the Citrus one and put the other 3 in the freezer to be enjoyed later. The recipe makes very nice cheesecake, it&#039;s smooth and creamy. I&#039;m very happy that I tried this. :D"
560491,513546,2014/5/4,4,The sauce this dish makes is very good!  I served it with white rice.  The chicken came out slightly dry but not so much it wasn&#039;t tasty.  May try this in a low temp oven rather than the crock pot.  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
37449,509151,2013/11/11,5,"Classic, easy, and much enjoyed!"
128473,509151,2014/2/16,5,"Thank you so much for a blast from the past nochlo.  I use to make these for my son, when he was little.  It was the only way I could get him to eat eggs.  This is a great recipe, quick and easy to make, with ingredients always found in the kitchen.  The bread was nicely grilled with a lovely runny egg.  It was scrumptious.  I will be enjoying this again, when my granddaughter comes for our next sleepover.  I&#039;ll have to ask her daddy if he has made these for her yet.   I used a nice bread and extra large eggs.  Thanks for sharing."
204024,505924,2014/4/14,5,"Easy to make and delicious to eat! We served this with vanilla ice cream and it&#039;s a complete hit here. Berries vary, but we got a very nice balance of sweetness and tartness the first try."
116977,505924,2016/7/29,5,"summer in Seattle means blackberries on practically every block. This is a simple, fast delicious recipe. The only think I would strive for next time might be a more crumbly, crunchy top. Mine was sort of soft, yet nice golden brown. But every agreed, taste can't get much better. Thanks for the recipe."
305531,506678,2014/5/10,5,Super yummy! I love recipes like this and I totally enjoyed it. I had some hot and then later tried some room temperature. We preferred it hot. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
2001863516,511756,2017/12/16,5,Really good! I used pasta made from veggies and low fat everything.
2140938,492743,2013/3/28,0,"This is a cute idea, my grandson loves Nutter Butters and will enjoy them. One note, if you use white chocolate you cannot use regular liquid food color, it won&#039;t blend with the chocolate. You must use powered color, found in the cake decorating aisle."
2761994,492743,2013/3/30,0,"The picture is cute,  i tried this with liquid food coloring, and turned into paste, horrible. I looked for powdered food color and the don&#039;t have it in my town, too small i guess. disappointing. Great idea."
2001276829,519340,2016/11/30,0,Love this recipe.... can not make enough...family and friends love ....love...love.. thank you
1800081434,519340,2014/11/5,0,I think you have a type o. The first direction says to sift first 6 ingredients. This doesn&#039;t make sense with ingredient list.
2000696922,519340,2015/11/20,3,"I agree with the other lady&#039;s comment about the recipe to sift the first 6 ingredients.  DONT do it.  I ruined my first batch by following the instructions.  Sift the flour and baking powder ONLY.     It would also be helpful to explain what is meant by roll and shape..... How about roll out the dough and form into a pinwheel.  The cookies were ok, a little bland and dry.  Not sure if I&#039;ll make these again."
2850165,519340,2015/12/5,1,I have to say this recipe is very disappointing. I feel as though I waisted all my ingredients. Could not believe there was no salt. Made this exactly as posted...It lacked flavor and there were no directions on how to shape the cookie. i ended up rolling them into logs and cutting them in discs ( like a shortbread) I read the two reviews this recipe got. I will know better not to make a recipe unless it has a lot of reviews that are star worthy.
2000730991,519340,2015/12/6,0,"This recipe is so incomplete, you will waste your valuable time &amp; money!! The directions are so wrong.....how on earth can you sift eggs, sugar &amp; butter?  If you try to follow the directions, it just won&#039;t work. 

Use my directions!!  Sift dry ingredients except the confectioners sugar!!!.....cream butter &amp; sugar...beat in eggs &amp; vanilla.....then add dry ingredients.   Save the confectioners sugar for the icing with vanilla &amp; water.

Good Luck!!"
2001274805,519340,2016/11/29,1,Waste of time seriously wrong recipe cookies taste like nothing and they are flat as a pancake also no salt don't waste your ingredients I threw mine out after I baked first batch
2001290047,519340,2016/12/10,0,I just made a batch... they seem to be an old fashioned biscuit type cookie. Good with tea or coffee. Wasn't really clear on how to twirl them into shape but here is what I did. I also added a little bit of almond extract to the frosting along with the vanilla.
2369272,519340,2016/12/13,3,"I agree, a little bland. If you only make 24 they would be huge. I got several dozen small ones that look like the picture. Rolled into pencil circumference logs. Too labor intensive to make again."
2001837413,519340,2017/12/3,0,"I have made these every year for Christmas, and are one of my favorites. For those who say they are bland did you forget to put in the vanilla, or perhaps you didn't dip them in icing? Does everything have to have chocolate in order to be flavorful?"
2002341551,519340,2018/11/20,4,this recipe made 117 cookies... they're so good though
2000697038,524486,2015/11/20,5,Wow what a great dish. Easy and Delicious. My whole family loved it

2203793,514422,2014/3/21,5,"Made this for dinner last night, all I can say is WOW!  Never thought something so easy could taste so delicious."
1803055517,499418,2014/8/21,5,"My husband says &quot;Wow, this tastes just like KFC&#039;s gravy&quot; and indeed it does...it is delicious! We made it vegan by using Earth Balance.  Also, we used whole wheat flour.  Thanks for the great recipe; it&#039;s a keeper!"
1803075803,518182,2014/8/27,0,Delicious! The only thing missing was maybe a red or green sauce.
1803075870,518182,2014/8/27,5,Yummy
1803077446,518182,2014/8/27,5,"Here I go again, loving food. Here I go again, eating well. Great recipe!"

143721,503579,2013/8/22,5,I made this as directed.  Sprinkled some on my scrambled eggs and hmmm excellent way to change up plain scrambled eggs.  Can&#039;t wait to try it on other foods.  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;
204024,503579,2013/8/23,5,This is great on chicken.  Made for ZWT9 for Hot Stuff.
480195,503579,2013/8/25,5,This is a great spice blend. I mixed one tbsp with 2 tbsp olive oil and 1/4 c grated onion to marinate my chicken kabobs. Excellent flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
157167,503579,2013/9/5,5,I used this in several dishes during ZWT - thanks for sharing it :)
296809,499299,2013/4/30,5,"Made for Spring PAC 2013, this fish was excellent -- Well-flavored, nicely cooked in the stated time &amp; easy-to-fix. I used cod vs halibut &amp; agree that using the lower amt of butter for the topping was best. As a matter of personal preference, I added a sprinkle of Old Bay &amp; a generous amt of lemon pepper. We were very pleased w/the outcome. We buy cod in 10 kilo pkgs, so I expect your recipe will revisit our table freq at DH&#039;s request. Thx for sharing this recipe w.us."
482376,499299,2014/4/14,5,"Delicious! I used cod and it worked beautifully. I followed your advice and used a bit less of the mayo mixture and a little less butter. The fish was beautifully cooked and very flavorful. I loved the crunchy topping. (FYI - your instructions don&#039;t say what to do with the parsely and garlic, so I assumed they got mixed in with the butter/bread crumb mixture. Also, the instructions didn&#039;t say what to do with that mixture - I topped the fish before putting it in to bake.) Thank you for a yummy fish recipe. Made for the Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef event in the contest and event forum."
2000812588,499299,2016/1/10,1,The recipe is not complete.  Where do you put the melted butter with the rest of the cheese &amp; bread crumbs?  If it goes on top with the first half why not mix it all at the same time?
296809,532714,2017/8/1,5,Made as written for CQ4 &amp; the Happy Campers team - My DH is an avid fisherman of the Icelandic highland lakes where trout abound. 1 of his fishing buddies recently gifted us w/freshly caught large trout fillets that were &quot;pan ready&quot; &amp; split by me to generous portion sizes for your recipe. This simple recipe &amp; method are the standard for cooking trout in Iceland &amp; my Siggi said I had never done it better. It was served w/sml garlic-parsley potatoes plus an eggplant CQ4 recipe &amp; made for a lovely meal that will grace our table often. A pic will post later today &amp; thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)

2000726597,524863,2015/12/3,5,This dish is simply amazing and so easy to cook.  I would totally this cook this for my boyfriend tonight.  We eat Ragu for spaghetti weekly but this is something that I would make with a spin on a classic sauce.
2000726683,524863,2015/12/3,5,"That looks amazing! I have never tried the original recipe it is based on, but I have to try this version!"

1369042,523306,2017/9/16,5,Very good recipe. Thanks for sharing. It will go great with the St. Louis style pork ribs I am smoking right now. I did make up the cole slaw recipe early this morning to allow for the spices to take their full effect. My only substitution was I used bagged angel-hair cole-slaw (cabbage) instead of a fresh head of cabbage to shred.
1802639358,515167,2014/4/3,5,All I got to say is: YUMMM-O!

1802648410,515167,2014/4/6,5,"My hubby wanted burgers and potato salad for dinner. I decided to prepare a homemade dinner which I don&#039;t get to do often because of my work hours. So I was looking for something easy, but not the ordinary in taste, saw this tropical potato salad and it was really easy to make. The flavor from the peaches really added to the dish. My hubby loved it of course. I&#039;ll be preparing this more in the future. Thanks!"
1802648925,515167,2014/4/6,5,This is an excellent potato salad recipe.

1802649423,515167,2014/4/7,5,I decided to change it up and make my potato salad this way and it was so good (so I am told)
1802649455,515167,2014/4/7,5,"Thought the peaches would be overbearing in flavor, but I was proved wrong... tastes amazing!"
1802649480,515167,2014/4/7,5,This was a very good recipe. I&#039;ll be making it for Easter for all our guests!
1802649498,515167,2014/4/7,5,A perfect addition to our lunches and dinners!
1802649510,515167,2014/4/7,5,"Reminds me of my gramps recipe, but with peaches instead of pineapple. Didn&#039;t think peaches would outdo the pineapple, but it did!"
1802649701,515167,2014/4/7,5,fantastic recipe
1802649712,515167,2014/4/7,5,Easy to follow and tastes good.
1802649758,515167,2014/4/7,5,I?ve been making the boring potato salad for years and just wanted to try something new for a change. Glad I found this recipe!
1802649756,515167,2014/4/7,5,A new favorite at the dinner table!
1802649773,515167,2014/4/7,5,My girlfriend went ga-ga over this!

1802649835,515167,2014/4/7,5,1st time I had tasted a potato salad with fruit in it and what an amazing combo!
1802649846,515167,2014/4/7,5,There is nothing I don&#039;t love about this potato salad!
1802649854,515167,2014/4/7,5,Hands down the best potato salad I have ever had
4439,515167,2014/4/7,0,"I made this for an Empty Nest group and sorry it was not a hit. Everyone thought the concept of a Potato Salad using mashed potatoes and ham and cheese was a good idea, but not one liked the peaches, Maybe I will try it without the peaches which were a deal breaker, sorry."
1802649786,515167,2014/4/7,5,I Just love it thanks
1802650292,515167,2014/4/7,5,This will be my new go to potato salad recipe.
1802650347,515167,2014/4/7,5,This is a great recipe...different from the potato salad I usually make and it was very good.
1802650776,515167,2014/4/7,5,"Between work, family and my volunteer services, I have little time for cooking because of my packed schedule. I hate eating fast food, love to prepare my own meals, it is just a matter of finding recipes that require little time to prepare and isn&#039;t lacking in flavor. This is one of those recipes, and is going under my favorites!"
1802650897,515167,2014/4/7,5,Absolutely DE-LISH!
1802650909,515167,2014/4/7,5,This was a grand slam!
1802650948,515167,2014/4/7,5,flavor is on point. 5 stars for sure

1802652156,515167,2014/4/8,5,"Simple, fast and rich in flavor."
1802652179,515167,2014/4/8,5,"From the wise Tina Turner, &quot;It&#039;s simply the best!&quot;"
1802652197,515167,2014/4/8,5,probably the best potato salad I&#039;d ever had.
1802652215,515167,2014/4/8,5,first time I made potato salad &amp; only way I&#039;ll be making it from now on!
1802652222,515167,2014/4/8,5,Amazing flavor!
1802652228,515167,2014/4/8,5,My new go to dish for comfort food
1802652244,515167,2014/4/8,5,best homemade potato salad ever
1802652256,515167,2014/4/8,5,Enjoying it as I type this! It is that good!
1802652278,515167,2014/4/8,5,highly recommend this!
1802656331,515167,2014/4/9,5,We made this earlier this week and it was a hit! Definitely encourages us to explore with different ingredients in the kitchen!
2709535,496805,2013/3/11,5,"Very flavorful steak and potato recipe.  Ingredients so easy to assemble for a delicious, hearty dish."
8629,515371,2014/10/30,3,"I rated this as good because I think there are others that will like this recipe but for me, it tasted too bitter."
2691191,495378,2013/2/12,0,Great for breakfast or brunch.  Easy to make with few ingredients.  Very tasty.
2628133,505198,2014/4/15,5,"I am always looking for whole wheat cookie recipes that are good and easy.. These are both., I made them last night for my husband and they turned out real good! I will make them again and put them in my to keep list! Thank you for sharing."
2000306099,505198,2015/6/30,5,"I replaced the butter with whole fat Greek yogurt, SO GOOD and adds another layer of health to this cookie!"
2000841859,505198,2016/3/28,5,"I more often bake bread so I was very skeptical about all the flour being wheat but this recipe is fantastic, and will replace my usual peanut butter recipe."
233238,505198,2017/2/5,5,These were delicious and will be my go to pb cookie recipe from now on. I'll try reducing the sugar next time to make healthier. Thank you for sharing the recipe.
2001425425,505198,2017/3/9,2,"I made these for my kids because I had wheat flour that I needed to use up. I didn't have the light butter the recipe called for so I just used regular butter. The dough turned out crumbly like there wasn't enough liquid in the recipe. I really couldn't roll them into a ball, I kinda had to smoosh them into ball shapes. Then when I pressed them with a fork they broke apart. Maybe there's more liquid in the light butter that makes the difference. This recipe was ok but I'll probably try a different one next time."
2001999983,505198,2018/2/19,4,"These worked out fine. I didn't have the issues Amanda D did with regular butter. I still need to fine tune the cooking time - there's not much buffer between undercooked and too much. Overall, a good recipe."
2730888,496805,2013/3/10,5,"This dish is delicious! The ingredients blend together perfectly, with none of them overpowering the taste of the others. The simplicity of the dish makes it perfect to fix after working all day. Add a green salad or other vegetable and you have a great meal!"
2708332,496805,2013/3/11,5,"This dish is simply scrumptious. Steak, potatoes, and cheese are 3 of my favorite foods.  This  recipe uses all 3 to make a tasty dish.  Loved it!!"
2694389,496805,2013/3/12,5,I love steak marsala and creamy mashed potatoes! This dish baked like a casserole was addictive. Its hard to stop eating! Very easy weeknight meal but tasty enough anytime. My whole family loved it and wanted more!
2735701,496805,2013/3/13,5,Easy & delicious!!  Plus it's low fat!  Definitely a 5 star recipe!
2748083,496805,2013/3/22,5,This was sooo yummy! It was presented really well and looked so pretty! Tasted great and I can&#039;t wait to make some!
2749062,496805,2013/3/22,5,Very tasty!  My  daughter Lonnie made it tonight and it is all gone.
2707951,496805,2013/3/24,4,spectacular! love it. the steak was cooked perfectly and tender. and everyone loves mashed potatoes. great dish
2710345,496805,2013/3/24,5,"I loved this! So easy to make and very flavorful! Great for a week nite meal. My husband wanted more, next time I may double the recipe!"
853152,496805,2013/3/24,5,What a great dish! With these ingredients how could you go wrong! Yum!
2753760,496805,2013/3/25,5,Had a good flavor to it....easy to make and would definitely make it again!!
2752903,496805,2013/3/25,5,Easy and Delicious!!  Great for a party or potluck!
2074905,504117,2015/7/10,5,The details in the directions make this recipe much easier to make.  And it tastes so good!
2000326132,504117,2016/10/27,5,This looks slammin! Have you ever tried it with different seafood?
126440,516682,2014/6/14,5,Great flavor and so addicting.  Will make these many times again.  They are soft and easy to eat.
1221394,498744,2013/11/26,5,Found this also in Cooking Light but didn&#039;t post it quick enough! Made this just as the recipe as written. I used Butoni&#039;s fresh fettuccine and also used the entire container of Butoni fresh marinara sauce. I made this just for my husband and I so we had leftovers for lunch the next day and it tasted even better! Quick easy and yummy! Great for a weeknight meal.
2855424,499290,2013/6/8,3,"Although this recipe is good but please be careful. My one egg burst in the microwave and made a mess. The other egg burst when I stuck a fork in it and splattered all over my hands, arm, wall and floor. It burnt my arm and hand. If your going to make this, try cooking it on the stove. Less chance of bursting eggs."
2001404862,516682,2017/2/24,5,Great recipe but there's no way this will produce &quot;48 cookies&quot;; I managed 12 4&quot; long biscotti.
8629,510563,2013/12/10,5,"I am not experienced at making pot roasts and have never made one on top of the stove.  This recipe turned out terrific for me.  I used a 3lb. roast and cooked it for about 2 1/2 hours on the stove.  It was so tender. I had some red wine in the fridge so I added just a little bit, about 1/4 c. to the beef broth when I started.  The onions got all melty soft.  Yum!  I&#039;d be proud to serve this to company.  Thanks for posting the recipe."
406513,519029,2017/2/16,5,"So delicious! My kids all ate it and sang its praises. Two of them even asked for seconds. This is not for the health conscious, but if you are looking for a treat or like me or low-carb high-fat... You should definitely try this!"
1800296559,507292,2013/11/22,5,I&#039;m giving this recipe 5 stars with the modifications I made. I cut the brown sugar down from 1.5 cup to 1 cup. They are still on the sweet side but I do enjoy sweet cookies. I also added 1.5 cups of Reese&#039;s Pieces. That was a wonderful addition in my opinion. These are soft in the center and a bit crunchy around the edges. I used 1 cup butter and no margarine and I made sure the butter was softened at room temperature before creaming it in my mixer. A delicious recipe I&#039;ll be making again. Enjoy!
1151959,507292,2013/12/10,3,More just like a peanut butter cookie and way to sweet!
1657060,498292,2014/11/10,0,"This appears much thicker than my grandma&#039;s pagach.  I&#039;m looking for a recipe that yields a thin pagach where the potatoes and cheese are integrated into the dough, and not layered.  Have you seen anything like that?"
2001911375,498292,2018/1/12,1,it was a waste of my time and money!! i will never make this again
2002092253,498292,2018/4/2,5,"Mom used to make it this way, but used to raise it and then flatten it, keep it over night and flatten it again so that it came out thin like unleavened bread. I actually make it using Pita Bread. My Dad came up with the idea and it works great Slice the pita bread in half... warm it in a toaster or toaster oven.... split it and stuff it with either mashed potatoes or cabbage.... toast it.. poke some holes it it... butter it and salt it. YUMMMMMM"
228458,502819,2013/8/23,5,"I am not much of a meat eater myself so I am giving this review based on reports from the troops (and my empty pan!). This was very easy to throw together and even easier to cook, even for a smelly vegetarian LOL. DH said it was very flavorful and delicious, though he and the kids preferred it without the lime dip, which I thought was rather tasty. I am currently devising other ways to use it, in fact :). Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
227978,502819,2013/8/25,4,"This was a great dish, Lavender Lynn.  The lime juice gave it a nice zest.  Made for ZWT #9 - SE Asia."
1052873,494047,2013/2/26,4,Used an Earl Grey teabag and coffee creamers. Made for February Sun and Spice 2013.
266635,505869,2013/10/7,5,"OM Goodness is this ice cream absolutely delish!  Sooo easy to make and sooo wonderful.  I&#039;ll be making this again for sure.  The espresso and cinnamon compliment each other so well and this recipe makes for a luscious dessert.  Made for NA/ME tag, October, 2013."
1146296,505869,2013/11/7,5,"Holy cow! Is this good!  We used regular sweetened condensed milk (the store we were at didn&#039;t carry a fat-free variety) and Stonyfield plain yogurt.  We also used an ice cream maker.  Next time (and there DEFINITELY will be a next time), we&#039;re going to try just mixing the (non-whipped) cream in with the other ingredients to see if we get the same results."
2000291000,525759,2016/5/25,5,"OMG... best.... cupcakes....EVER. The flavor is amazing. I just happened to have lavender flowers as I buy them from a tea company to use in baking. This was my first ever vegan cupcake recipe and I was afraid it wouldn't rise. Nope, these are nice and fluffy and moist. Seriously, I will never make regular cupcakes again. So yummy. My only complaint is that the recipe only made 10 cupcakes instead of 12. I am taking them to a surprise party tomorrow. My vegan friends are going to love them."
884728,494359,2013/1/29,5,Just printed the recipe out to add to my list for dinner next week.  Sounds great!

2667703,494359,2013/1/30,5,Cajun seasonings and blue cheese - how can you go wrong -YUM!  I would try this recipe.
2667778,494359,2013/1/30,5,"This sounds delish, I will be printing this for my football party!"
2665061,494359,2013/1/29,0,Recipe sounds very interesting with a variety of flavor combinations.   Looking forward to making this!
2697964,494359,2013/2/17,5,I made this for the family last night and it was a hit!  Even my picky eater loved it!
2415384,494359,2013/2/21,5,Look and sounds marvelous!
2000092052,518888,2016/10/17,5,Wow!! This is a great recipe. My daughter and I made this for a family get together and everyone LOVED it. I plan to make it again.
2959348,505346,2013/8/25,3,"Pretty good.  A bit more &quot;cakey&quot; than usual, but good.  My daughter said they didn&#039;t taste like peanut butter, but everyone else liked them."
266635,494624,2014/2/18,4,"This is a very tasty dish -- I&#039;ve never eaten ricotta cheese this way before, but it&#039;s really good along with the honey and fruit.  I&#039;m not a big papaya lover so I hope you won&#039;t mind that substituted some organic strawberries instead.  I added a touch more honey to the top of the fruit since the berries were a little on the tart side.  Both DH and I really enjoyed this ricotta swirl as a dessert vs. as a breakfast item.  Made for PRMR, February, 2014."
2859324,498382,2013/6/11,4,"This is pretty tasty!  I made a bunch of substitutions just because I was using what I had.  (In case you&#039;re interested, I subbed the chile powder and dried red chili pepper for 2 chiles in adobo sauce, chickpea flour for brown rice flour, tomato paste for 1/2 cup marinara sauce, and I added 1/4 cup wheat gluten and 2 Tbsp brown rice flour since there was a lot of extra liquid from using the marinara sauce).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will say the nutritional info that shows up when you print out the recipe is all wrong. Per serving, there is actually 160 calories, 14g carbs, 2g fat, 23 g protein, 460mg sodium and 1 g sugar.  (This is using the substitutions I made, noted above, but would be similar)."
480195,503015,2013/7/23,5,We enjoyed this dish for Sunday breakfast. It had very good flavor and texture. I served it with home style potatoes. Thanks for the recipe.
174096,503015,2013/9/7,5,Great dish!  Loved the blend of veggies and the smokiness from the sausage.  There was a nice little zip from the spices.  Thanks for sharing!
227652,536411,2018/11/2,5,"Hi, this recipe was wonderful. I baked mine for 22 min and that seemed just fine."
107583,508461,2014/4/30,5,"WOW!  This is going into the regular rotation.  The sauce is delicious.  I did cut the roasting time to 20 minutes, which was plenty.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
47559,503681,2013/8/19,5,This simple little recipe was so delicious!  It was refreshing and cool especially after a spicy meal.  It&#039;s a keeper and I will surely make this again.
2844172,503681,2013/8/21,0,NICE EASY i LOVE IT.I had made this for zwt9....great find this recipe
67728,503681,2013/8/26,5,"This was a perfect light dessert, and so easy to make. This would even make a nice addition to breakfast, too. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9"
2000431901,530284,2017/2/23,2,Not crazy about this. My kids liked it though.
2001005949,502124,2018/10/15,5,"The sweet of the mango, the heat of the serrano matched with the acid of citrus pairs nicely with the firm opah."
37449,502906,2013/7/17,5,Yum yum! I made but left out the orange segments. What a tasty salad! I halved the recipe and much enjoyed. Thanks! Made by team Hot Stuff!
480195,502906,2013/7/24,5,I doubled the recipe for a Greek buffet dinner party and this one one of two surprise hits of the meal! Everyone absolutely loved this and asked for the recipe. It was easy enough to make and very tasty. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
461834,511623,2014/2/5,4,"I just love vinegar on my french fries and get them with the vinegar at restaurants and fairs/festivals and couldn&#039;t wait to try this recipe.  First time making my own homemade potato chips and they were perfect.  I had problems with the vinegar air and ended up making it twice.  I used &quot;Knox&quot; gelatin powder and in the directions it just said to be combined with 2 cups liquid.  The first time I used 1/4 cup water to soak the powder, then added boiling 100 ml water and then the cool 150 ml of vinegar.  This never developed soft peaks or even soft set in the refrigerator over night, so threw it out and started over.  This time I used 1/4 of cool water to soak the heaping 1/2 tsp of gelatin powder, then adding the remaining water and the 150 ml of vinegar (which were boiling) to the soaked mixture.  I whipped for a long time with my KitchenAid mixer on high and, again, no soft peaks.  I decided to just refrigerate it over night and check it in the morning.  Yeah!!!  It worked and was thickened!!  I then used my mandolin and mini fryer for the chips and re-whipped the vinegar with great results.  The only change I made was to used malt vinegar (personal preference - not so sweet) and used Himalayan sea salt.  I wasn&#039;t a fan of the cold vinegar/gelatin, would probably let it get to room temp. next time but really loved the combination!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
2000516545,498768,2015/10/3,0,Delicious! Everyone who tried it really enjoyed it. Very moist and flavorful. I used honey and molasses for sweetener and used deglet dates because I couldn&#039;t find medjool dates (added extra dates because deglet dates are smaller). Be forwarned - this is a very calorie dense dessert (entire cake has approximately 3800 calories)!
2597942,503055,2013/8/1,5,"Wow! What a great idea turning one of my fav sandwiches into a nice (somewhat light) salad (not so much bread). Brilliant idea! I made this for me and hubbys lunch yesterday,  and it was fabulous. (I will post a picture as soon as I can get in uploaded from hubby&#039;s cellphone). I already had homemade croutons on hand, so it made assembly even quicker. I halved the recipe for just the 2 of us. Next time I will double the dressing to keep on hand in a jar in the fridge! I also used a pre-packged bag of mixed salad greens. We both enjoyed it very much. Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
226863,503055,2013/8/8,5,"Wow! This isn&#039;t a salad, it&#039;s a meal!  Do delicious!  I made exactly as posted, with all romaine and used all the meats and cheeses as posted.  As a previous reviewer stated, I will make sure I double this dressing, because I could just eat it with a spoon!!!  Salty, but soooo delicious.  I had this tonight when the heat index was 115....I&#039;ll try and make it home tomorrow at lunch and throw another salad together so I can post a pic.  This recipe certainly deserves one.  It is delicious! Made for PRMR tag game."
143318,503055,2013/9/22,5,Five star dressing! Easy to make entree salad. Next time I will use half the amount of meat.
486725,503055,2015/6/25,5,What a great salad. For an entree salad for two I halved the croutons and dressing (but kept the olives at the original amount) and quartered the salad ingredients and salt. It was a wonderful combo!
1856536,524873,2015/12/2,5,This dish looks absolutely delicious!  I would love to make it for company this weekend.  Good luck!
1680722,504332,2014/6/2,5,"This sauce is delicious. &lt;br/&gt;I loved it for spring rolls, cooked prawn and a selection of dumplings. It&#039;s very easy, fast and I have always the ingredients on hand so that it will never been necessary to prepare a batch in advance.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for suggesting us this recipe and proposing it here!"
226863,503121,2013/12/18,5,"Made these exactly as posted except I cooked them on the charcoal grill.  We love that smoky taste!  We really enjoyed the cajun seasoning, and I used the ranch on my burgers.  DS tried one with ranch, and then switched to regular mayo and ketchup.  Great quick little meal or appetizer.  Thanks for sharing! Made for your win in Football pool."
305531,503121,2014/12/13,5,Yum! These were fun and good. I used King&#039;s Hawaiian rolls for the buns and regular tomatoes and monterey jack cheese for these. These were easy to make and made a cute presentation. Thanks twissis for sharing this keeper recipe. Congrats on another win in the football pool!
679953,503121,2014/12/16,5,"Made these as written though I omitted the tomatoes.  The Ranch dressing and the cajon seasonings really were the hit with us.  They made a great dinner along with some fries, and some soup.  Made for your win in Football Pool."
237297,506389,2013/9/1,0,Brownies from the panty??!  I think you may need to correct your title!!
1147071,507144,2013/9/30,0,"Coppercloud, this is not a bad review because of you it is just that I cannot comment at ATK so I thought since this is the exact recipe that I used from ATK, I would write it here.  Followed the directions to a tee and after cooking for an hour, it still had almost all of the stock left in and all I had in return is crispy potatoes on top and sloshy, soft potatoes on the bottom.  May try again with half the amount of stock but I feel if would be all burned if I cooked it any longer without reducing the liquid."
2324285,507414,2014/2/17,4,"These taste like juicy little meatloafs, with bruschetta topping.  Tasty, but I thought the amount of Italian seasoning was a too much.  It tasted overly &quot;herby.&quot;  I think maybe one teaspoon would have been more then enough.  I really liked the topping, but there was more of it than could fit on top of the patties, so I just used the leftovers as garnish when they were plated."
369715,500260,2013/5/20,3,This was OK for us. I cooked off a pound of egg noodles but I only added about half of them as the mixture was very dry. I ended up adding three cans of soup and only 12 ounces of vegetables. This also needed some seasoning of us. I used about 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and some onion powder. I also used about 1/2 cup of milk.
2000140354,529506,2017/1/3,0,"Hi Dee! Since the recipe calls for the frozen avocados to be thawed beforehand, I would say you could use regular, fresh avocados in their place without much trouble. Let us know how it turns out!"
2001326325,529506,2017/1/4,0,Is Food.com European? What's with the grams of cream cheese? Am I going to have to have a converter for all of your recipes? All other ingredients are normal! I can't picture metric amounts in my head!
2002254807,536443,2018/8/24,5,I have not made yet. I have a rare stomach disorder. I have big time food exclusions. I CAN eat beats and cooked fruit with no seeds. I think I can adapt this for me. Thanks for sharing.
169430,493699,2016/4/2,5,"I do believe that I have a brand new favorite. I made this yesterday as a lunch dish and it was hard to stop with my allotted portion! I just kept on wanting &quot;just one more bite&quot;.  Fortunately, it&#039;s nicely diabetic friendly and that makes the wonderful flavors, mouth feel and satisfaction  all the more appealing. Thank you, my friend, for this marvelous keeper recipe."

280271,504482,2013/7/28,5,Loved these stuffed eggs...I did cut the recipe down to suit the two of us...I really enjoyed the sweetness the honey mustard gave the egg yolk and the crunch of the bacon...you can barely taste the cheese...what I really liked was that none of the ingredients were dominate...and the mayo was perfect for my taste...just on the dry side...thanks for posting it...=)
383346,504482,2013/8/7,5,These deviled eggs are so good with the bacon and cheese.  Thanks breezermom :)  Made for Rookie tag game
296809,504482,2013/12/4,5,Made for your Football Pool win #3 &amp; these deviled eggs were a big hit w/my DH as I expected them to be since they are very similar to my own &quot;loaded&quot; deviled eggs that he says are 1 of the 3 reasons he married me. I halved the recipe &amp; I made 1 chg. I subbed low-fat sour cream for half of the mayo. We shared them w/my BIL for our wkly Sat morning brunch &amp; he loved them too. Thx for sharing the recipe w/us.
37636,504482,2015/2/3,5,Very good flavor. We never had eggs with honey mustard but liked these just fine. Sprinkled crumbled bacon on the tops for garnish. Thanks for sharing.
157425,504482,2015/10/4,5,"My DH loves deviled eggs and I like trying new recipes for him to taste. These eggs were a big hit with him and I also enjoyed one or two.   :) I used a package of real bacon bits that were chopped into small pieces instead of frying bacon. The honey mustard was a nice touch with the mayo, I used Hellman&#039;s mayo,  and sharp cheddar cheese added a little zing.  Next time might try dijon or a grainy mustard instead of the honey mustard. Congrats for winning the Football Pool breezermom!"
128473,504482,2016/11/23,5,"Awesome deviled eggs breezer. They were perfect, smooth, velvety and full of flavor. We really enjoyed the addition of the bacon and cheese. They were quick and easy to make with excellent textures and an amazing flavor. Thank you for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy often. Made for What's on the Menu? Tag Game."
131126,504482,2016/11/27,5,My family enjoys deviled eggs so I am always trying a new version. This recipe is a keeper and has already been requested again. I did eliminate the salt and used precooked bacon. I garnished the eggs with a little more bacon crumbles and fresh italian parsley. They looked so pretty on the plate and the plate emptied quickly. Thank you for sharing the recipe!
486725,504482,2017/2/15,5,Bacon makes these deviled eggs special. Next time I will omit the salt and double the mayo.
2827307,500361,2013/5/15,5,I tried this recipe and it was really YUMMY!!!. My whole family loved it and i will definatly make it again and again.
5498914,500361,2013/10/6,5,"This was absolutely delicious! I added shredded lettuce and diced tomato and a dollop of sour cream on top of the servings. I did use corn/wheat tortillas for this recipe, however, due to dietary needs in our family. Anyhow, I highly recommend this recipe."
1803018654,500361,2014/8/16,0,These enchiladas were wonderful! I made them exactly as written and we enjoyed them so very much. My husband said they were &quot;quite tasty&quot; and that they were a &quot;keeper&quot;. Thank you for posting them.
1220686,492725,2014/1/21,5,"This is a very tasty casserole.  I was looking for a recipe that didn&#039;t use canned soup, so this was what I needed.  I added 1/4 tsp garlic salt, used half sour cream and half milk for the half-and-half, and used less chicken and added some fully cooked veggies (broccoli or mixed veggies) to round it out.  I didn&#039;t have pecans, so I used some crushed stuffing mix and cheese."
2943612,494562,2013/8/13,5,"I used your recipe! It was delicious.  I didn&#039;t add any corn though, I substituted that with carrots! I also didn&#039;t use one whole onion just a little bit and added garlic to it instead."
11634365,494562,2014/6/10,0,I&#039;m going to try this but add carrots with the potatoes instead of the broccoli and corn at the end. I will come back with a review afterwards.
305531,494562,2015/8/9,5,"This was a really nice curry. I&#039;ve always seen the Japanese curry box in the grocery store but have never tried it until now. I used some pork tenderloin and made as directed. I&#039;ll make this one again. Thanks, Sofie for a nice keeper. Made for Culinary Quest 2015."
107135,494562,2015/8/26,5,i love this stuff cherry bombers
2597942,507241,2014/2/6,4,"Very good recipe, Pat. I was a bit confused by the instructions, but I think I figured it out. I made them by adding the breadcrumbs to the 3/4 c cheese in Step #4.  I think that is correct. Anyway, they turned out quite tasty and I plan to make them again. Served with ham steaks. Thanks for posting. (Made for PRMR)."
1802921187,517082,2014/7/13,5,"I made these biscuits this morning for my family. They were wonderful! This recipe reminded me of the biscuits my great grandmother used to make. This will be my go to buscuit recipe from now on, they looked and tasted fantastic."
1802930953,517082,2014/7/15,5,I made these biscuits and they were the most wonderful biscuits I ever had. The only thing is that it only makes 24 biscuits when I always make 30 Biscuits. I still give this 5 stars.
1802934737,517082,2014/7/16,5,Perfection!
1802934748,517082,2014/7/16,5,These biscuits are really good and have a perfect texture.
400708,517082,2016/5/18,5,"Made these for a Sunday Brunch with family and they were great, towering, light and fluffy and went together easy. Served with a choice of chicken gravy or butter and homemade jam. They made me look like a star, fantastic recipe"
2001196744,517082,2016/10/6,5,These are simply the best. I made them for the office and everyone wanted the recipe. Thank you.
128473,502796,2013/7/21,5,"Wow, was this french toast ever good, I can&#039;t believe the flavor, it was excellent.  The toast was light, fluffy and perfectly cooked, simply wonderful. I garnished the french toast with a little icing sugar, that was all it needed.  Served with recipe #502824 and sliced oranges for a wonderful breakfast, that I will enjoy again and again. Thanks so much for sharing a new favorite.  Made for ZWT9 - Hot Pink Panthers on the Prowl."
526666,502796,2013/7/22,5,"I used a nice italian loaf for this and it turned out wonderful. The orange flavoring was a very welcome addition. DH and DS loved it! Thanks for sharing a simple, stylish breakfast recipe, Lavender Lynn!"
107135,502796,2013/7/22,5,"very orangey loved this. must like orange, sweet enough does not need syrup.zwt9 ds would love this"
157167,502796,2013/7/24,5,"The flavor of this was great!  I used Recipe #114709 for the bread, and found that it really didn&#039;t soak in the egg mixture at all like a store bought bread would have - the egg was only just on the outside and the middle was plain bread, but that was my choice of ingredient&#039;s fault and not the recipe. :)  For ZWT9"
227978,502796,2013/7/27,5,"This was excellent, Lavender Lynn.  The addition of the orange liqueur and orange zest took this recipe to a new height.  I used a dense Italian bread, so each slice would soak up the mixture nicely, and it was great.  I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to serve this to company.  Made for ZWT9 (Cajun/Creole)."
383346,502796,2013/9/4,5,I used a leftover of baguette to do this recipe.  And for the orange liqueur I used Triple Sec.  Great recipe.  We liked it a lot.  Thanks Lynn :)  Made for ZWT9
461834,512721,2015/11/4,5,"OMGosh!!!  So darn good!!  I made 1/4 of the recipe!!  I did use my 1-2 inch cookie scoop and it made about  3+ dozen cookies.  I made the first 1 1/2 batch without pecans and then made the rest with them for myself and my son&#039;s girlfriend.  I loved that you used the food processor to grind the oats, you can&#039;t tell they are in the cookies!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe and congrats on your win in the football pool again!!"
163112,500678,2014/1/21,5,"Delicious!  It does need a good amount of salt.  This makes a lot.  The garnishes were gone after the 4 of us ate (we finished off more than half of the completed dish).  Fried raisins...who knew?  This was nice &amp; quick, too.  The girls enjoyed choosing their own garnishes.  Made for veggie Swap 1/14."
45040906,508331,2014/3/12,5,"These are absolutely incredible cupcakes. The recipe is spot on too, no need to change a thing. They come out perfect every time."
1800292167,508331,2014/5/29,5,These cupcakes are so yummy!
2000060315,508331,2015/3/14,3,"These cupcakes would be yummy, if it weren&#039;t for the horrible ganache recipe. Using bittersweet chocolate made it so bitter you couldn&#039;t even eat it. Ended up adding another cup of powdered sugar to the ganache."
2000104865,508331,2015/3/31,5,"Absolutely fabulous recipe. Came out so perfect, I immediately baked another batch. I made my cupcakes into mini cupcakes and didn&#039;t use liners so you could just pop the whole thing in your mouth. Only thing I changed was to use semi sweet chocolate in the ganache. Great recipe"
43028169,500323,2014/3/5,0,This person is worried about the carbs when there is a ton of fat in this recipe? dump the mayo and use lite sour cream!
5688630,500323,2014/6/18,5,This is delicious!  It was a huge hit with the family.  I did cook the peppers and onions until they were almost caramelized and omitted the jalapenos on half of the casserole for the little ones.  The biscuit base makes a perfect tex-mex dish.  Will use again!
44822988,500323,2014/9/4,0,"There is a B&amp;B in South Dakota that serves this, but they use tater tots, it is fast and easy.  I dice up potatoes and use those instead to save on calories and going to try substituting  cream of mushroom soup for the mayo and see how that works out."
2000152567,500323,2015/4/19,5,Just finished making this and it is DELICIOUS
2001635444,500323,2017/9/10,5,"the first time I made this I followed the recipe. it was fabulous and everyone from my dad to my 2 year old grandson loved it. i just put another one in the oven and this one i did tweak the recipe but only in the respect of using some of the things i wanted to get rid of from the fridge. last night i made tacos and chicken black bean quesadillas. i had some left over black beans so i sprinkled them on top of the tomato layer. i didn't have (nor do i care for) green peppers so i used orange/red/yellow mini peppers. i had half a fresh jalapeno left over from making salsa so i minced just a little and cooked that with the peppers and onions. i used just a bit because of the kids. lastly, i mixed the mayo, sour cream, green onions (about three chopped well) and the cheese altogether and spread that on the top. i did think about putting some black olives on top but decided not this time. the reason i put the last four ingredients together is that my dad mentioned the first time that it was too thick of a layer so i thought mixing it will make it a bit better for him. anything for dad! looking forward to trying it out but i am sure that it will be delish as the basic recipe was not changed with the addition of the black beans."
2702777,497261,2013/3/11,5,"These are SO YUMMY, and pretty simple to make!"

2201870,497261,2013/3/15,5,This looks like a fun salad!
2739289,497261,2013/3/16,5,YUM! Beautiful too!
2696543,497261,2013/3/16,5,"Delicious!  Quick enough for weeknights, but special enough for company.  Definitely a make-again."
2739376,497261,2013/3/16,0,"Fun, tasty and easy to make! This is a fantastic dish!"
2423055,497261,2013/3/16,5,This really IS a quick and easy but yet elegant salad. I think I&#039;m gong to serve it  at an upcoming ladies luncheon. It will be perfect!
2709122,497261,2013/3/16,0,Loved this salad!!!  Easy and delicious!!
2211242,497261,2013/3/16,5,one of the best recipes I have made with simply potatoes
2739595,497261,2013/3/16,0,Quick fun New England salad.  I&#039;ve tried it...delicious:)
2692024,497261,2013/3/16,5,"This is the EASIEST crab cake recipe I&#039;ve ever come across and though I&#039;d never think to use mashed potatoes in a crab cake, it binds it perfectly and the texture is smooth and rich. The Old Bay is something of a must when I make crab cakes but the combination of the potatoes and the Old Bay made the flavor much more balanced than in other recipes I&#039;ve used. And made it a bit more kid-friendly, which is also VERY nice for a mom trying to cook interesting food that everyone will eat.  The salad was creamy, spicy, slightly sweet and crunchy.  So good, so easy. And it makes me think of summer."
2692832,497261,2013/3/16,5,What an amazing blend of flavors!
2739806,497261,2013/3/16,5,These were very easy to assemble &amp; cook .. best part of this was they were super delicious. thank you for sharing these yummy Crabby Casear Salads with us.
2430064,497261,2013/3/16,5,did i tell u how beautiful this is? because it won&#039;t let me rate I&#039;m guessing this was so good I came back twice...back again and was able to rate! WOW I want this!
2667297,497261,2013/3/17,5,"Simple, delicious and a new family favorite! Thanks for the great recipe."
1648510,497261,2013/3/17,5,"I am a huge fan of blue crabs and love a good crab cake!!  This recipe is delicious,so easy to make and very flavorful for a recipe with only a few ingredients.  This is definitely on my recipe rotation for quick and easy summer meals!!!"
510096,497261,2013/3/18,5,This is a simple to prepare salad that is packed with flavor...love!
2701060,497261,2013/3/18,5,Yum!  I&#039;m happy to have you make this dish for me anytime!
2667767,497261,2013/3/19,5,I&#039;d like this for lunch please ;)/&lt;br/&gt;Great idea too.
2201427,497261,2013/3/20,5,What a wonderful recipe!!  I&#039;m a big fan of crabcakes and this is such an innovative recipe .... with only 5 ingredients!!??  Delicious!!!!
914360,497261,2013/3/25,5,Oohh ah...perfect salads !  Love the combinations !  Five stars !
2710087,497261,2013/3/25,5,"It was in a word--delicious. The crab cakes with Caesar salad is one of the finest things I have had. The flavors blend so well together that the second, the third and the fourth bites get better as you continue to eat. This is something you can have at anytime of year and be ultimately satisfied!"
2209000,497261,2013/3/25,5,Looks delish!
2204786,497261,2013/3/26,5,I&#039;m all over this!! xo
285039,500636,2013/7/5,5,"Absolutely delicious, but absolutely not enough sauce!  Double or maybe triple this when serving 4-6 people.  I used a combination of red, brown, and yellow grape and cherry tomatoes and served it over ginormous pasta noodles, grilled zucchini and with grilled Italian turkey sausage.  I tossed in 1/2 cup of fresh basil and smoked, fresh mozzarella.  Divine!  Will be making this again!"
1800154750,506922,2013/10/26,5,"This recipe is easy to follow, the use of the foil makes for easy clean up, the taste is delectable!!! One batch can be shared with a couple of families, great for the holidays! A great choice for a holiday cookie/bar exchange. The possibilities are endless, fruit choices can be substituted, cherries are great too!!! A family favorite!"
288188,506922,2014/10/20,5,"This Mess Is The BOMB!! I&#039;m licking ALL Pans! I had two helpings while it was still warm, BUT could eat the ENTIRE batch when chilled!"
542159,517517,2014/8/5,5,What a truly pleasing flavor the dried mushrooms brought to these yummy potatoes. I made using mixed dried wild mushrooms which brought a slightly chewy texture and delightful flavor. Thanks for the post.
131126,517517,2014/8/8,5,I had a package of asst dried mushrooms so used it.  The mushrooms added a pleasing woody flavor and chewy texture to the potatoes.  I julianned the potatoes on a mandoline so had thin and slightly crispy potatoes.  I would definitely make these again.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014
80353,517517,2014/8/8,5,"Potatoes, mushrooms and onions are a serious trio flavour-wise!  Will definitely make this dish again."
690623,517517,2014/8/13,5,Thoroughly enjoyed these potatoes.  I had dried Chanterelles so used them.  Really tasty and will be made again!  Thanks for posting. Made for Culinary Quest 2014
2002257366,518718,2018/9/6,0,I made this however I added 2cans of peaches to it and it was VERY GOOD!
2000469815,518718,2018/11/22,5,I have made this dessert for the last 2 years and had to come back to find it again. It was great and a hit with my whole family. I used can peaches in it's original juice.
128473,493191,2013/3/5,5,"Loved these potatoes, so yummy.  Quick and easy to make with excellent results. Wonderful light and fluffy texture with lots of flavor.  Made exactly as written but used fresh parsley, cause I had some in the house.  Thanks for sharing a recipe that i will make again and again.  My dh who hates garlic in potatoes loved these tasty taters."
1706426,493191,2013/11/5,5,"Very tasty!  Made for your football win, 2013"
2597942,493191,2013/12/2,5,"I made these lovely potatoes for our Thanksgiving meal this year. I followed the recipe ALMOST to the letter, with only 2 little changes. The few days prior to Thanksgiving, hubby and I got into a potato skin&quot; eating marathon. Each day that I made the potato skins, I saved the &quot;guts&quot; of the potatoes in a tupper-ware bowl in the fridge. I say that I probably had made at least 12 pre-baked potatoes. So on Thanksgiving, I simply made the remainder of this recipe, skipping the boiling of raw potatoes. After everything was mixed, the potatoes seemed a bit thick (maybe because they were a little cold to start or that I had too many potatoes). I placed them in the oven as directed. About 10 minutes into baking, hubby asked if I would put some shredded cheddar cheese over the top of the potatoes. I thought, why not?! They tuned out silky and fantastic. We had young an old guest alike that raved over them and wanted to know what I put in them. I think next time I will go a little heavier on the garlic flavor (and these will be making an encore appearance on our Christmas table). Thanks for posting a keeper. (Made for Football Pool week 10 win)"
266635,493191,2014/11/20,5,Absolutely delicious!  I made a half batch of these wonderful potatoes and wish I had made more.  This dish is certainly Company-worthy and I&#039;ll definitely make them again.  Made for the Football Tag game.
539686,505755,2013/8/16,5,"This is a delicious recipe, made for ZWT #9, but will jump right into my Best Of for the year!!"
2549237,505755,2013/8/21,5,"These were very delicious!  I loved the unique flavor and the ease of this recipe.  I used turkey, simply because it was easier and the burgers came out surprisingly moist for turkey burgers.  We really liked the pita bread option on these as well.  I served them alongside oven baked French fries and Recipe #505772 for a delicious African meal.  Made for the Moroccan and Tunisian round of ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers!"
145352,505755,2013/9/7,5,These had such a great and unique flavor!!! And they were very moist for turkey burgers. The sauce was fantastic. Made for ZWT 9!
482376,505755,2013/9/10,5,"Yummy meal. I didn&#039;t add the olives or apricots, but otherwise kept true to the recipe. The tukery burgers were great. I especially loved the sauce. Yummy. The zucchini was perfect since I still have a ton in my garden. Thanks!"
226867,509843,2014/1/10,5,"I think this would make a great side-dish for pork, chicken or turkey. Mine was more tart than the original recipe b/c I used less than 1/4 cup sugar but I don&#039;t know that I would want it much sweeter anyway. It sure was a lovely color!!"
266635,509843,2014/3/29,5,"Delicious cranberry applesauce!  I will be serving it with your potato latkes, but I think it would be wonderful in oatmeal for breakfast or as the other reviewer mentioned -- with a meat dish.  My apples were very tender, but still chunky and I think I like that better than the regular pureed texture of applesauce.  I also used organic grape juice vs. the wine; otherwise, I stayed with the recipe instructions for 4 servings.  Made for PRMR, March, 2014."
107135,509843,2014/9/5,5,i didnt use the sugar this was sweet /tart enough for me  loved the wine with the fruit good match&lt;br/&gt;cakepops on parade
2000710124,521894,2016/8/1,4,Really easy and tasty Irish breakfast
128473,522870,2015/8/1,5,"I really enjoyed this sweet dish.  The caramel was tasty the apple slices were wonderful, soft, tender and sweet.   I didn&#039;t make the whole recipe, just enough for pancakes because I knew that I would like it too much, and I was right.  I served them as a filling for Swiss Pancakes, it made a wonderful breakfast.  Thank you so much for sharing."
369715,492853,2013/1/8,3,This was OK for us but very bland. It really didn't have much flavor to it. I followed the recipe as written. I cooked a pound of macaroni but only used about a 1/4 of them. If I would have used the full pound I don't think you would have tasted anything but the noodles. I took it the next day for lunch and it still didn't have much flavor (at times things taste a lot better when they sit). Made for an easy quick meal.
2498569,492853,2013/1/8,4,"We did this with a pound of hamburger and half a pound of italian sausage. We also used italian diced tomatos. Very, very tasty!"
2000606582,524301,2015/11/6,5,So delicious!
482933,502540,2014/1/13,5,Could drink this-- it is so good! Wouldn&#039;t change a thing. Had as part of our lunch on a warm day here. Thank you for sharing.
1803644660,502540,2018/3/23,0,Watery what did i do????
2001303066,528125,2016/12/17,5,"I made this recipe for my husband and we both absolutely loved it, It was easy and looked amazing."
340141,504596,2013/8/3,5,"I absolutely loved this soup, but DH hated it.  (If you use sea scallops, be sure to quarter them; I only halved them, and I wonder if he ran into one that wasn&#039;t completely done.   I&#039;m not sure.)   The mixture of seafoods was very tasty, as was the seasoning.   I wish I&#039;d used a slightly drier white wine.  However, this was still delicious!   ZWT9"
2000400832,517418,2015/8/13,5,"I have not eaten an ice Cream Sundae in fifty years or more. I came to this recipe from an article in WSJ about the new Emperor and I am happy to imagine eating this super caloric concoction. Owing to a recent illness, resulting in a loss of 11 pounds, I am within 6 pounds of my goal weight and think it is time for a &#039;cheat meal&#039;, something I occasionally do with relish. 

If, after my first and only trial of this recipe, I change my mind, I&#039;ll be back!"
2796729,499191,2013/4/22,5,These were amazing. I made them on Sunday and we all had them for breakfast and snacks today. They were gone so fast! Thanks for a great recipe.
895132,499191,2014/4/8,5,"Great! Easy to make and very tasty. I omitted the stevia because this amount of honey is already plenty sweet for me. For the bran I used rice bran to be gluten free (no gf oat bran here), and for the oil I used coconut oil. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
2686518,494303,2013/2/10,5,Delicious! A great new idea for pizza!
381180,498398,2014/4/25,3,"I love sauteed mushrooms with garlic, but was very disappointed with the addition of the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce!  Although I reduced the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce by half, that was all I tasted.  The flavor was too intense and sharp for my palate.  I added 1/2 teaspoon sugar trying to cut the sharpness, but that helped only a little.  Maybe on a hamburger the sharpness would be much less noticeable?  Tagged for Spring PAC 2014."
1802697128,498398,2014/4/26,5,Great with steaks. My all time favorite mushrooms! Would be great on a burger too but I just eat them straight. Strong flavor though so not for for a delicate palate
679953,501415,2013/6/13,5,"Wow !!!!  Are these ever good.  A couple of MINOR adjustments.  Used ground sirloin only, and left out the lamb.  Omitted the salt, and used minced white onion in place of the red onion. The mint/thyme combination was fantastic, and the mint was very noticable. Made the argula-cucumber salad with this too, with the yogurt/feta, a very nice quick very tast dinner that was also served with recipe#438317#438317.  Definately recommended to anyone that would like a nice twist to meatloaf, and a complete dinner.  Made for PRMR Tag."
2200666,494303,2013/2/10,0,Oh Yum!!! Love this pizza creation.
427421,509964,2013/12/16,5,This was VERY easy and oh so good!  I used dried cranberries (craisins) in place of the cherries and it was still very good.  Going to have to make another batch!
844554,520336,2015/9/21,4,I needed to use up some turkey meat and coleslaw and this fit the bill. I added some chili powder and cumin because we like it spicy but this will feed us for the next couple of nights. Thanks.
1592049,494303,2013/2/12,5,Delicious!! Love ALL These GREAT FLAVORS !!
145352,493600,2014/9/3,5,So very good!!!! I love the mix of ingredients! Made for CQ 2014.
80353,493600,2014/9/5,5,The kids favourite for dinner last night - loved the pineapple/ham combo.
323186,508450,2015/1/13,5,"Very easy and quick, other than the soaking, which I did do.    My husband loves fish so this was a treat.    He would have liked more sauce ---  but then, he is more used to my making fish with Thai curry sauces or similar.    I liked it, the nuts and lime were divine, and I liked frying it off beforehand.     Overall, enjoyed this recipe!   Thank you for sharing, made for Consideration Tag game."
381180,508450,2013/11/18,5,"Delicious!  Very impressive with the pecan/onion mixture on top ~ just a hint of lime!  I used cod and due to time restraints, I did not do the milk soak.  Tagged for Fall Photo Tag 2013."
482376,508450,2014/8/10,5,"Delicious! I was out all day and didn&#039;t have time to soak the fish for 2 hours. I set them in the milk for about 10 min and still had a great outcome. I loved the flavor due to all the spices, but I especially loved the toasted pecans with green onion. Really yummy recipe. Thank you! Made for the International Agents of QUEST for Culinary Quest U.S. Southern region."
865936,508450,2014/8/15,5,Absolutely delicious!  I will be making this often.  I just love nuts with fish!
1802860104,504838,2014/6/26,5,This is delicious!! Husband loved it as well. Will definitely make it again!
383346,507927,2013/11/4,5,These sloppy joes were so yummy.  Even DH enjoyed.  DS liked these a lot because of the pineapples.  They were great with cheese.  thanks Nancy :)  Made for PRMR tag game
39835,507927,2014/5/26,5,"Very good and a different take on sloppy joes which we enjoyed. Next time i&#039;ll used less chili powder, but they were great as is. Made as directed. Thanks for sharing!"
296809,507927,2014/12/18,5,"Made for your latest Football Pool win &amp; a nice change from the more typical sloppy joes. I have the more adventurous palate at our house, so I took a cue from 1 of the reviewers &amp; reduced the amt of chili powder a bit for DH. I also used crushed pineapple because I had it on-hand. DH picked this recipe to make for your win &amp; was pretty proud of himself that he could pick so well. He suggested I take some lessons in picking winners from him. :-)"
133174,535120,2018/5/10,5,I was very happy to find your recipe. Being gluten free has challenges. This recipe was used to as a base for a gluten free version. Since the gluten free dough is less pliable I simply rolled the dough out and then gently wrapped a turkey hot dog inside. Instead of cheddar cheese a low fat Swiss was used. Thank you for sharing the recipe.
107135,503348,2013/8/5,5,"this is amazing ,the carrots really extend the cheese .check how hot your onion is for kids.try this one is great zwt9"
1925885,503754,2016/8/17,4,"I really liked the bread-soaking technique, which is somewhat similar to how DH makes meatballs, except he squeezes out the liquid. We live in a Greek area and have had these meatballs quite a few times at restaurants and at relative's homes. The recipe was good, but we all noticed too much of a flavor from the white wine - way too strong in the meatballs themselves. Perhaps if the bread had been squeezed out it might have made a difference. We will definitely be making these again, but reducing the wine and using red instead of white. Made for Culinary Quest 2016."
266635,503060,2013/8/1,5,"We really enjoyed these grilled shrimp.  Made the marinade as directed, but added a little brown sugar to offset the tartness of the orange and the slightly bitter taste of the chili paste -- it turned out really good.  Served with a side salad and DH was a happy man.  Made for ZWT9 - Caribbean, August, 2013."
2000898907,493647,2016/3/2,5,Great recipe!  I added fresh sliced carrots!
219942,503146,2013/8/22,5,"What a fabulous mixture of flavors I never would have thought to put together!  These sandwiches went over well at our house tonight. I almost left the mint out, didn&#039;t think we&#039;d like it in there, and wasn&#039;t sure about the whole 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, but ended up saying, &quot;what the heck,&quot; and followed the recipe exactly. Don&#039;t over-think, do it just as she says!  This recipe goes in the keeper file! And I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli for ease and quickness. Thanks, twissis, this is another winner. ZWT9"
131126,503146,2013/8/25,5,Although I left out the mint (personal preference) I otherwise followed the directions.  The combination of flavors is outstanding and what looks like a long list of ingredients fit together perfectly.  I do think this made more than 4 generous servings.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!
2273238,503146,2014/3/5,5,We really like these pita sandwiches. They are good to make and keep in the refrigerator for lunch. My family doesn&#039;t like the olives so I leave them out. Instead of using mayonnaise I buy hummus to spread on the insides of the pita and it gives it that extra something.
107583,499863,2014/5/9,5,Very good and easy to make.  I skipped the powdered sugar.  I also got 36 instead of 24 and I think my Madeleine pan is standard size.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC.
2414876,524715,2015/11/19,5,Marvelous Concept!
2000694654,524715,2015/11/19,5,Love the flavor profile and the combination of textures!
2000696595,524715,2015/11/20,5,Great combo! Easy to do!
2710214,524715,2015/11/21,5,"Great for company or for a potluck,Creamy and yummy"
386585,501548,2013/9/9,5,"This was fantastic, and so easy to put together.  I made this exactly as posted, using beef and fresh chopped tomatoes from the garden.  I used a green curry paste, which had some heat, but was not overwhelming. I also did not have red chilies, but had some hot long green chilies instead. I love all kinds of curries, and this one did not disappoint!  I will definitely make this again.  Made for Holiday Tag Game."
866963,493977,2013/1/24,5,"This was surprisingly good for as easy as it was. Rather than using just plain ground beef I used a veal, beef, pork mixture and about a half a pound of bulk sausage. I resisted my natural inclination to change the meatballs further by adding chopped onions and garlic along with additional spices and was glad I  had because the chicken flavored Stove Top Stuffing Mix gave them all the flavor they needed. I did saute some red onion and garlic in about 1 tablespoon of butter before adding the jar of Heinz beef and mushroom gravy. I also added some sliced mushrooms and left the meatballs simmer in the sauce while waiting for the water to boil and noodles to cook. All in all it only took about an hour from start to finish. This is a welcome addition to my busy night menu list. (1)"
2001170977,517548,2017/5/12,4,"Great recipe! I followed the instructions but did not use the chili powder. The recipe does not say when to add the chopped onion so I just put it in when I added the soup mixture. This was very tender and flavorful however, I would add fresh garlic."
381180,510505,2014/4/26,5,"Fabulous!  I grated my ginger root (that had been suspended in dry sherry) on my microplane into the vinegar in a saucepan, and reduced it by half.  I added the sugar, and the remaining sauce ingredients, EXCEPT the salt, to the hot vinegar mixture, as I was a little concerned about how the raw garlic would taste if added later.  I brought the asparagus to a boil in salted water, submerged the asparagus into the ice bath, then dried the asparagus on paper towels, before placing it onto a platter.  I then poured the ginger sauce over the asparagus and chilled it for about an hour before serving.  I thought the flavor was best at room temperature.  Tagged under the 24-hour rule for Zaar Stars."
171790,493302,2013/8/7,5,Very nice combination of flavors. The orange juice/banana sauce is a nice touch. I served the coconut on the side because some people in my family don&#039;t care for it. Made for Soup-A-Stars ZWT9.
2000382876,497230,2016/3/11,4,"Although I did not have apple cider and substituted water, this turned out great!  I added one chopped apple and some pecans last night, then added honey and cream this morning.  Wonderful having breakfast ready for you!"
2001362355,497230,2018/9/6,5,"This was sooo good! I only used 2 cups apple juice and the rest water for liquid. I also added a shake or two of ground cloves and nutmeg, chopped apples, raisins and a tablespoon of butter."
328933,500349,2013/5/17,4,"Just made this tonight for tea, only thing I didn&#039;t use was sherry didn&#039;t have any. Also didn&#039;t broil it as the youngin was hungry. But it was delishious."
163112,517482,2014/9/25,4,This was good!  No leftovers!  The only thing is it&#039;s too heavy on the sour cream.  Maybe add another egg or cut back on sour cream and add another egg?  Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ.
569171,504684,2013/10/12,0,"This is a very virtually fat-free good recipe. I first saw it on the fat-free vegan site and came over here to enter it so I would have it in my cookbook, but it was already here. Thank you! The flavors are very fresh--the slight bitterness of the brussel sprouts, the sweet squash, the nutty flavor from the chickpeas and just a bit of red pepper hot. Delicious! I used 24 ounces of the brussel sprouts and dried thyme because I had no dried basil and it was great. I will definitely be making this many more times."
280271,509055,2014/2/3,5,This was so yummy...I cut it down to 2 servings and made it in my little crock pot...it came out so tasty and sweet...I made it to use in recipe #464017 and it worked great...thanks for posting it...=)
1803381176,509055,2014/11/21,0,"After hunting for the perfect pulled pork recipe, I stopped here.  It&#039;s just about perfect.  I did add just a few of my own preferences.  I salt, peppered, and browned the meat in a large skillet along with one big chopped onion.  In the sauce I added one big teaspoon of red chili flakes.  That&#039;s it.  Sweet, tangy, and slightly hot is perfect for me."
280271,492959,2013/3/31,4,"This was very tasty...I did serve it with recipe #492956 I was a bit on the messy side...but that made it finger licking good...I decided not to use the foo processor, so I just chopped it up by hand...one less thing to clean...I could see using this as a lettuce wrap also...made for Spring PAC 2013 =)"
323186,513850,2014/8/12,5,"What an interesting recipe,  I really enjoyed this.  I wondered if the potatoes would cook properly, but yes, they do. And the bacon is a very good touch!!!!    I&#039;m glad I made this because it isn&#039;t a method of cooking potatoes that might have ocurred to me, but is truly delicious (and the leftovers are to die for!!!), I will be making this again, thank you lazyme!!!   I made and enjoyed this for International Agents of QUEST, Russian sector."
2000333572,513850,2015/7/12,3,"no one liked it apart from my 2 year old, i put extra bacon in it and had to mix it up in the washing bowl as i didnt have a bowl big enough! it tasted so bland but better when pepper was added after.  im hoping i can freeze it as we have loads left over and maybe mix some mustard and pepper in it before re heating"
1800224896,509029,2013/11/11,4,The dish was excellent. Even my picky child liked it (with a little cheese on top). The high sodium level is a concern so to help a little I used low sodium broth and tomato sauce.
323186,509029,2013/11/25,5,"I love dahl and dont make it that often, I have to say this was a real treat and I shall make a point of serving it up more regularly!!   Smelled fabulous, tasted divine, my lucky husband still has some for lunch today!!!!    Enjoyed trhe addition of egg as garnish!    Overall, fabulous, thank you for another winner, rpgaymer!!  made for PRMR tag game"
2758285,495480,2013/3/30,5,"So glad to find this. My Slovak Nana and my mother always made this for Easter, but I never learned while they were still with us. This is exactly the way they made it, with salt and cracked pepper and not sugar  as I see some recipes call for. Going to make it right now."
286566,509997,2014/4/13,5,"I scaled for one serve and with a slice of wholemeal/wholegrain toast it made a wonderful and delicious and quick breakfast. thank you ElizabethKnicely, made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
386585,509997,2014/4/27,5,"This was really very tasty, and made for a nice satisfying breakfast.  I also scaled this to one serving - and made a few changes.  Rather than oil, I used butter.  Since it said crumbled smoked salmon, I had to find the real wood-smoked thing instead of lox.  I used cream cheese with chives, and decided to forgo the raw green onion sprinkled on top.  I sauteed green onion in the butter for a minute or two before adding the egg mixture, and then scrambled everything together.  Served on some toast, it was delicious!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
488441,495307,2013/3/4,4,"I liked the flavor and the texture inside the cabbage leaf, but would have liked a less crunchy vessel, maybe a lettuce leaf to hold it all together. The cabbage leafs were too crunchy and firm. You could easily use prepared rotisserie chicken to save time, but I realize for this contest, the recipe had to use chicken drumsticks. Good flavors!"
58104,495307,2013/3/4,4,"Excellent! With a little tweaking this would be 5 stars. Like using a different vessel and some ginger and cilantro/mint to the filling would take this over the top! I did use romaine lettuce for the wrap in place of the cabbage. I can see if the cabbage choice was a tender napa but the contest called for straight up green cabbage. Just didn't want to wrestle the head of cabbage to remove leaves. I omitted the 1 teaspoon sesame oil and didn't miss it. Used cellophane noodles in place of the rice It`s what I had and what we enjoy. I did cut the sugar in half. Used the full amount of pepper flakes. Used a hand grater for the carrots and radishes. This is so quick to put together. Thank you for posting this refreshing, light, tasty low carb meal."
2001437701,511919,2017/3/15,0,Recipe says 1/2 sugar free ketchup. Is that 1/2 cup?
40636702,509262,2014/1/29,5,"Good :).  The flavor is right. Didn&#039;t have pork, used turkey sausage. After pouring into crock it was deep and I chickened out and poured into baking dish as it provided a greater surface area for browning.  Happy to have this yummy healthy breakfast to serve to family in the mornings. Thank you."
2001270626,528069,2016/11/26,5,OMG this dish is delicious! Would be good with any type of meat.
2001270627,528069,2016/11/26,0,This was fabulous . It is a little chilly here and this was sooo comforting. You can play with the quantity of each ingredient but the flavor is soooo good!!!!
2824459,533538,2018/4/1,5,This bread was my first attempt at baking in cast iron. It was really delicious. I will be making it again soon. Thanks to those who answered my questions . Great recipe.

157167,506812,2013/9/24,5,"This was great - even my picky eater commented on how good the potatoes were.  I used red potatoes, and 4 weighed just over 1 lb.  The only onion I had on hand was softball sized, so I used 1/4 cup diced to put in the mashed potatoes, and 2 slices to get rings to fry and place on top.  I think much more onion would have been overpowering - I also rinsed the diced onion in cold water to take some of the &quot;bite&quot; out before mixing it into the potatoes.  Thanks for sharing :)"
169430,506812,2014/4/29,5,"Great, and welcome, from the usual mashed spuds. They were well enjoyed with Recipe #504502 this evening. I was out of the pine nuts but otherwise made just as ask.

251917,506812,2014/5/27,5,Recipe Swap #88: These mashed potatoes were out of this world! The pine nuts are such a welcome addition to this side dish! The added crunch and nutty flavor - delicious!

1410862,530095,2018/5/5,5,"Wow! Followed recipe exactly, and let me say...we devoured these! Loved the spicy/sweet flavors, and the texture of the cauliflower was perfect. We will make this again, thank you for sharing!!"
679953,504150,2013/8/15,5,"Truly a gem that made for a nice breakfast.  For the fruit, I used pineapple, and banana, and for the cereal I used some honey oat granola cereal.  So easy, so quick.  The flavors were nice, though using the honey granola cereal bought out the honey flavor.  That&#039;s a good thing. Enjoyed this very much.  Made for PRMR Tag."
171790,504150,2013/9/12,4,I made this using mangoes as my tropical fruit. I cut the recipe in half and had one serving as directed. I mixed the 2nd serving all together and took it to work with me. Delicious. Made for Veggie Swap 62.
1783373,504150,2014/2/19,5,"I really liked the crystallized ginger in this recipe and enjoyed the combination very much.  Definitely reminds me of Spring and Summer with the tropicaliness.  I used kiwi, oranges, mango, canteloupe, pineapple, strawberries, and blackberries.  I thought the fresh pineapple made for the best taste.  Sprinkled some granola and crystallized ginger over the top as well.  Made it for Please Review My Recipe.  Thank you ellie, for a keeper."
198154,494162,2018/3/2,5,"I doubled the garlic for this recipe. But that is the norm for us. Next time I may add even more cause we love our garlic. This made for a quick, yet tasty, week night meal. Served with a side of asparagus."
266635,502519,2013/7/5,5,"Fantastic seasoning!  We really enjoyed our steaks tonight -- the seasoning really gave it a great flavor; especially the cinnamon.  I did not have any caraway seed and I opted to leave out the rosemary and replace it with garlic.  I highly recommend trying this seasoning mix.  Made for PRMR, July, 2013."
593927,493687,2013/5/8,5,"Simple but pretty tasty. DD1 (5 years old) liked it a lot. I used organic quinoa pasta, fresh organic broccoli, organic olive oil, organic garlic cloves, pressed, &amp; sea salt. Made for Aussie Swap."
2001449771,504952,2017/3/22,0,"Is the ginger, garlic, and crushed red chilis added into the pot with the oil, or the stir-fry?"
88099,508197,2014/4/27,5,Where is that 10 star.  this is just excellent and the spice flavoring is perfect although I didn&#039;t have fresh grated nutmeg I used about 1/8 teaspoon of the dried and it was just right.  My crust did burn as most of my pies do (I don&#039;t have one of the crust covers that some use)  I also baked mine about 10 minutes longer because I didn&#039;t think it had set totally.  I covered it with foil that last little bit.  I will be making this a lot.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
1803709601,508197,2015/1/26,3,"This is NOT a Hoosier Pie! Being from Indiana, having this as our state pie, and having grandparents who would make it from scratch I should know. Hoosier Pie (sugar cream pie, desperation pie) does not contain eggs. It&#039;s a mix of sugar and cream and uses flour to thicken the mix.While this might be good, this is not labeled correctly and should be renamed. Personally I think this one is too temperamental because it contains eggs. Sugar cream pie is supposed to be more forgiving than this is. To get the lovely golden brown, marbled texture that a sugar cream pie has we back it high for a little, then drop the temp down for the rest of the time. Try baking at 450 degrees F for 10 minutes, then drop the temperature down to 325 for 35 minutes. Tastes better the next day after being chilled, in my personal opinion."
448342,493476,2013/1/14,5,"The Peach Tree Tearoom Cookbook  (Fredericksburg, Texas) has a similar recipe that I have been using.  The only difference is that their recipe adds onions (which I leave out) and parsley.  This is my favorite rice dish to go with a Mexican supper.  My husband likes the spicier version with veg. in  it, so sometimes I make both versions.  The Arroz Blanco leftovers go to make fried rice the next morning.  Thanks for sharing this recipe."
1925885,533127,2017/8/22,5,"Wowee! I must admit to having doubts while putting this cake together, and thinking &quot;this better be good after all this expense!&quot;. But I shouldn't have worried, cuz you always post good recipes! This made a lot of batter, and I didn't want to spill all over my recently cleaned oven, so I filled the 8x8 as much as I thought was good and made the rest in a small 6&quot; cake pan. I'll try a 9x9 pan next time. This worked out for me. The cake is just full of coconut flavor and that wonderful nuance of the rosewater. So tender and so good! I love semolina flour... This is definitely a company kind of cake, as it is very sweet, very dense and very rich, you only need a small piece! Thanks so much for posting this wonderful recipe! Made for CQ4."
2688819,495638,2013/2/27,5,This was really a quick and delicious supper. A must try.
2585084,504840,2013/8/5,3,"I like sardines, boiled eggs, and rye.  I am sorry, but I did not care for them in this combination."
2001655651,511857,2017/8/3,0,This recipe is not how PF Chang's make their crab wontons.
350921,499879,2013/7/25,3,"Taste is okay, but I was surprised by the texture of the plantain; was like a very firm potato.  First time I have cooked plantain so I may have done something wrong."
107135,504840,2013/8/2,5,love this sandwich  its easy and tasty zwt9
482376,504840,2013/8/10,4,This was good. I served it on homemade rye bread. I actually think I would have like it better if I had used the sardines in mustard. Thanks for an interesting recipe. Made for the Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9
199848,511766,2014/1/14,5,I am not a low-carb fanatic.  I made this simply because I love cauliflower.  This turned out great.  I used the regular onion plus some green onion; it was tasty!  This would make a wonderful breakfast or brunch casserole.  It&#039;s delicious even if you don&#039;t worry about carbs.  Thanx!
212478,511766,2015/7/27,4,"I am doing a low carb &quot;phase&quot; this week, and was looking for something new to try.  This was very easy to make, and quite good. I used frozen chopped cauli and onions, and bought some diced ham, so it was VERY quick to throw together.  However, I personally need more spice in my food than the average person. After tasting it, I added garlic, a bit of sea salt, and some crushed red pepper. Just right! :-)"
2001181247,511766,2016/9/24,5,"This is an excellent recipe. I use the riced cauliflower from Trader Joe's, diced ham, added some seasonings, bell peppers and used half the amount of cheese."
2001419455,511766,2017/3/5,5,I use green bell pepper in place of the onion. It is a family favorite.
2001577881,511766,2017/6/15,5,i loved it for not liking cauliflower.. i am the only one that will eat it.. hubby no way... is this freezable? i cannot eat the whole pan by my self in a few days.. any suggestions? i did add greenpepper and a few mushrooms to it.. AMAZING!!!
2001962200,511766,2018/1/30,2,My husband liked it flavor was good but I thought it was too wet for my liking.
895132,499407,2014/9/7,5,"Delicious! Made this for the Dragon Buffet of CQ 2014, and we hugely enjoyed it! Very good instructions, easy to make. Thanks for posting!"
2001619678,502569,2017/7/9,5,Brilliant! Used it to make sweet chilli chicken ??. Thank you for such a quick and easy sauce recipe. ??
2002130781,502569,2018/4/26,5,Made this and it was so easy and quick. Really pleased
2002162894,502569,2018/5/24,0,Simple and tasty. I added some grated ginger and garlic and it was delicious ??
2598853,495225,2013/8/18,2,"Looks like it has good ideas, but the ingredients and directions are a hot mess.  There is no chicken in the ingredients, is it raw or already cooked?  You marinate the chicken, but when do you put it on the pizza.  Ingredients say Italian seasoning in butter, directions say ranch dressing mix in butter.  Directions say to mix the spinach, ranch dressing (1.5 cups in ingredients), and 1/3 cup dressing (more really??).  I love to try this but can&#039;t make sense of it."
451301,492896,2013/4/17,5,"Made this according to the directions and was very pleased with the flavor,, And the gravy is fabulous.  Simple and easy to do, makes this a big winner, ty"
1703153,502620,2013/8/1,4,Quite good - we had it with spicy black bean burgers and the sweetness of the salsa balanced the spiciness of the burger nicely.  Even my husband liked it.
37449,499087,2014/5/9,5,"I used the kale and some romaine lettuce, broccoli slaw and peas instead of edamame. I made a nice pomagranate red wine vinegar vinaigrette. Thanks for posting! Made for Pick a Chef(PAC) event, spring 2014."
1803520306,498543,2014/12/18,1,"I am incredibly disappointed in this recipe. I should have known, based on the times I have to cook other similar egg/bread casserole dishes, that 30 minutes was not nearly enough time to cook this dish and have it set up. I had it in there for an HOUR before it was done enough to be eaten, and even then it was still way too &quot;wet&quot;. I&#039;m guessing another couple slices of bread would have done the trick. Very irritating when you get up at 5 am to fix this for some very busy holiday workers and have it take over 30 minutes longer than anticipated and still doesn&#039;t set up right."
2000355415,498543,2015/7/22,5,I have made this many times and it comes out perfectly! My family begs me to make it! It is a great dish to take to church breakfasts! When I&#039;ve been in a hurry I have left the potatoes off and it is just as good !
2002254185,498543,2018/8/22,0,My daughter makes this for our family and it turns out great every time! If you can't make it then try peanut butter and jelly you'll do fine. This is one easy recipe and delicious!
2000676599,524613,2015/11/14,5,Amazing dish! It feels somewhat like lasagna but replace the tomato sauce with creamy wonderful goodness. This dish is very popular in my family and this recipie really is the best way to make it!
2001603977,503915,2017/6/28,3,&quot;Brown&quot; the shrimp? I don't think so. It would be chewy and tough.

In Summer I frequently use fresh fruits, but I always have canned peaches, apricots, and pineapple on hand when fresh fruit is not at peak flavor ~ this morning I used canned pineapple chunks, and tossed in some fresh blueberries to boot!  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag (due August 14th)."
133174,493087,2013/8/20,4,Fruit and cottage cheese have been a tradition for me for many years.  I used a fresh peach and made 2 smaller parfaits.  DH and I enjoyed these this morning with a muffin for a breakfast.  Made for Aussie Swap.

Using a high quality dark chocolate cocoa powder makes a remarkable difference in the flavor &amp; filtering the brew thru a coffee filter or paper towel makes a remarkable difference in how it is savored. As you can see from the pic, there is a collection of residue around the rim of the cup that would not be there if it was filtered. I've tried dry mixes like this before &amp; had the same issue, but this mixture is better than most. I'm very glad I found your recipe.

67728,502986,2014/1/5,5,"I have made a quick version of these in the past, but I wanted to try a more authentic version this time. I&#039;m leaving no stars right now because they won&#039;t be officially ready to use for another couple of weeks, but they were really simple to toss together. I used Meyer lemons, so I didn&#039;t feel that the 3 day soaking part was needed, because the Meyer lemon skin is already pretty soft. I added all the optional spices, and I added an extra two lemons to the jar to fill it. The wait is killing me, LOL! I will come back and put stars once they are ready to be used. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9&lt;br/&gt;Original review 8/26/13, EDITED 1/4/14: I&#039;ve been working my way through my jar of lemons, tossing them into all sorts of things to give them some Moroccan flair (soups, chicken dishes, etc). These are definitely worth the wait if you are a fan of preserved lemons, as I am. I was too chicken to keep these at room temp once I dipped into them, so I&#039;ve been keeping the jar in the fridge. I think I might finish off the rest of the jar by making some lemony crockpot lamb (I can&#039;t remember the actual recipe number right now, but I&#039;ve made and reviewed it once before and it was fabulous). Thanks for posting, Sharon (and being so patient waiting for my actual review, too). I definitely recommend this recipe!"
1800295106,503261,2013/11/22,5,"This recipe is amazing!! It is as good or better than skipper&#039;s. I halved the amount of clams because I wanted to test the recipe and originally was only going to make a half batch. But as I was cooking, the flavors were so good, I decided to make a full batch and I did use pre-sliced package Bacon, so there were six slices to fill in anywhere there might have been a clam or two missing. But I really didn&#039;t notice anything missing at all because it was just so good!! I did sub heavy cream for half half because that&#039;s what I had on hand. Just for fun, I added a little corn. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever need to look for another clam chowder recipe. I will make this again and again. I&#039;m thinking of taking some over to my parents for lunch but I will certainly be making a double batch so there&#039;s some left for me!!"
1803167512,503261,2014/9/24,3,"This seems promising but there are a few holes in the instructions, like how much bottled clan juice and pepper sauce? Neither are in the ingredients so I didn&#039;t buy them. If you update that I&#039;ll retry and change my rating"
1803446867,503261,2014/12/1,5,"Tastes great! Hard to say if it&#039;s just like Skipper&#039;s, because it&#039;s been so many years since I&#039;ve had it, but I think it&#039;s pretty close! I also added some thyme during the cooking of veggies and bacon. I didn&#039;t have hot sauce so I sprinkled in some cayenne pepper instead. Worked just fine!

Served it with a banana chocolate chip muffin and fruit for a great lunch!!  Made for your win in the football pool, congrats!!"

I was really glad to stumble upon this yummy recipe.  I made the recipe as written, with a few minor changes.  I added 3/4 tsp. baking powder to the egg/ cream mixture. I always do this when I make scrambled eggs or omelets as I think it makes for fluffier eggs.  Also, I used 4-cheese Mexican blend instead of the cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. I used the optional bacon and cooked it all in my 12&quot; cast iron skillet. I served the scramble topped with salsa and creme fraiche for a delicious, filling breakfast.

2736762,497099,2013/3/14,5,"A tasty simple dish! Perfect for servings as a main dish, complement to the main dish or an appetizer."
2001749662,504971,2017/10/12,0,"This recipe is really, I mean really good! Using the variety of beans and the pretty colors from the corn and peppers was a feast to the eyes as well. I did add 1 full cup of rice and finished off with a dallop of sour cream and chopped green onions. Thanks for sharing this recipe"
131126,499457,2013/4/30,5,I enjoyed the combination of citrus and cilantro  flavors in this salad.  It&#039;s pretty too! I thought the cumin added a surprise element and it could even be served with fish or shrimp tacos.  I thin sliced the radishes on a mandoline and liked the result.  Made for Spring Safari PAC.
226863,499457,2013/12/8,4,"I loved the beautiful color combination in this recipe....just beautiful.  I found the cumin flavor a bit strong, but really enjoyed the radishes and the cilantro.  Beautiful dish!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Photo Tag game."
280271,499457,2014/1/19,4,I loved all the flavors except the cumin...it really is over powering...maybe just a dash would work...the citrus adds a nice tartness and the sugar make it sweet...the cilantro gives it a nice kick...I&#039;m always happy finding a new dish for radishes...next time I think I will just omit the cumin...may try a touch of cayenne to add a little heat...=)
1803347961,511933,2014/11/15,4,"This was  Yummy but very strong, I will definitely reduce the amount of alcohol next time, and we used vanilla extract instead of vanilla beans."
1802995102,516669,2014/8/4,0,Swap out the veggie broth and used chicken broth- sprinkle with parmesean!  Great quick meal for busy lifestyle
210473,500763,2018/4/12,5,PERFECT recipe - just what I was looking for. Very flavorful and a great use for leftover ham (and just right for some afternoon tea sandwiches). I didn't blend until smooth - wanted to leave a little texture. Love that it wasn't too creamy or greasy or too spicey. Thanks for posting.
2030233,511611,2014/1/16,5,"Yummmmm.... thanks for the recipe. Time saving and delicious. This will become a staple in my household. My husband is a pasta fiend and he loved it. ALL my kids, especially my picky 3 yr old, said mmmm... all through dinner."
37449,516018,2014/5/23,5,"I halved the recipe, used veggie bacon bits and dried cranberries instead of cherries. Just delicious! Thanks for posting! :)"
305531,493600,2014/9/6,5,"Nice side dish for an Asian meal. Simple and tasty. Thanks, Jackie, for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
542159,513395,2014/9/28,5,"I love sweet potatoes (I used the dark red yams) mixed with spicy and this salad did not disappoint, it was so tasty that it became my whole lunch today. I loved the mix of texture and flavors and found the crispy bits of chorizo to be a fantastic complement to the yam/ sweet potato. Thanks for the post."
296809,500575,2013/7/20,5,"Made for the Goddesses &amp; the ZWT-9 Bread N&#039;awlins Style Challenge, this bread pudding is a lovely indulgence, but something I would only make to WOW guests. At nearly 1,000 cals per serving (based on a 10-12 serving yield) &amp; altho not my orig intent, my 1st thought as I prepped the pudding was to take your intro to heart, serve it w/o the bourbon cream sauce &amp; save making the bourbon cream sauce for a wow-factor worthy occasion. I halved the recipe &amp; got 8 generous servings vs the 10-12 stated for the whole recipe, so the nutritional data may well be better than stated. We decided to sample this special dessert 3 ways: Plain, lightly dusted w/powd sugar &amp; w/a sml amt of light caramel sauce (primarily for the pics). This is so good &amp; will be made again for guests. I will include the bourbon cream sauce on that occasion &amp; post a new pic. Thx for sharing this yummy recipe w/us. :)"
865936,500575,2013/7/20,5,"This bread pudding is to-die-for!  I think the sauce really elevates the dessert.  I also agree that it is more like 16 to 20 servings, depending on how you cut it.  I tried to cut into 32 little squares like brownies, but I NEEDED just a little bit more!  Made for the ZWT #9 Bread N&#039;awlins&#039; Style Challenge."
80353,500575,2013/7/24,5,"Why did we love this dessert?  Homey, indulgent goodness.  Another thing I loved was how it used up the 2 cans of evaporated milk I had in my pantry from a previous contest, and a can of crushed pineapple that has just been waiting to be used for a couple of years.  Served this to family when they came over, and they all agreed it was delicious.  Thanks for a great variation on a favourite."
242766,500575,2013/7/24,5,"Wow...this bread pudding is so delicious!!  It&#039;s sweet and rich, just like a bread pudding should be.  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8&quot;x 8&quot; dish for 45 minutes, although now I wish I&#039;d made a full recipe...it&#039;s that yummy.  The bourbon sauce definitely puts it over the top!  I was a little leery of the 5 Tablespoons vanilla extract because I thought it sounded like a lot, but I went ahead and added it as written and it turned out perfect. Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe. It is definitely a keeper!!  Made for ZWT9 &quot;Bread N&#039;awlins Style&quot; challenge for The Apron String Travelers"
280271,514172,2014/3/25,5,Excellent! This has to be the first dish I ever made where the hubby didn&#039;t add salt or soy sauce to it...he found it perfect as is...I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and made the asparagus version...along with using the shiitake mushrooms...I omitted the extra sugar and glad that I did because it was sweet enough...the sauce is the star...loved the flavor combo...the water chestnuts (which I don&#039;t think add any flavor) worked great..they added a nice pop of freshness with a crunchiness to the overall dish...this is a keeper and going in my best of 2014 cookbook...thanks for posting it...=)
381180,514172,2014/4/12,5,"Quick, easy, pretty, and a delicious blend of flavors!  I made this with asparagus and baby bella mushrooms; always love the crunch of the water chestnuts.  For PRMR, tagged 03/29, due 04/12/14."
895132,494576,2014/4/13,5,"This is indeed different from the sauerbraten which I&#039;m used to, but it is SOO good!!! You&#039;re right, the sauce is incredibly delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter - perfect directions, easy to follow, and the result is awesome. Oh, and I used both, apple butter and molasses :)&lt;br/&gt;Thanks so much for sharing this winner! DH is no big fan of sauerbraten, but he raved about this one.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
305531,503296,2013/7/20,5,Yum! These were really good. I loved how the brown sugar offset the spices for a wonderfully tasty dish. Thanks Sharon for such a good and easy side. Made for ZWT9.
653438,509006,2014/4/17,5,"Made this today for DH and I and it was definately a keeper.   I did cut the recipe in half, used two small cloves of garlic, sauteed fresh onion and peppers (didn&#039;t have any frozen) and used dried basil.  Delicious!  Next time I think I will add a few more fresh vegetables like slivered carrots, celery and maybe corn because I do love vegetable soups.  DH suggested some meat like sausage but that is because he loves meat.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
169430,507329,2014/1/7,4,Yummy. I made a half amount last night and used frozen corn (not going to get fresh around her at this time of year) and plain flake salt. In my case I needed a little more water and I thought that it wouldn&#039;t hurt to use half water and half milk. It made a welcome change from the usual sides and went very nicely with the chicken.
2001423119,530626,2017/3/8,0,I haven't tried cooking this yet but once a week I cook something new so next week this will be that and I'm actually thinking of adding jalapenos with the green chiles because my family loves spicy food. When I do cook this and find out how everyone feels about it then I will rate it.
2399085,500956,2013/7/5,5,It was really good and tender. I would suggest to go light on the lime mayo. I was not a big fan of it in heavy doses. But it was perfect with a thin/small amount. Great recipe!!! Thanks
296809,504593,2013/8/13,5,"Made for ZWT-9 &amp; a fellow Goddess - I had always wanted to make a Braudterta &amp; then came face-to-face w/your recipe in the AP Cookbook. There are actually 2 types of bread used for Braudterta - Loaf-type slices that are filled &amp; layered .. or .. Larger jelly-roll-type slices that are filled &amp; rolled. The jelly-roll-type slice is used more often &amp; all we could find. I made the filling a dy early using Icelandic baby shrimp, chilled it overnight &amp; assembled the terta today about 2 hrs prior to serving at an afternoon coffee for 9 (This prevents the bread from becoming soggy as the terta sits). 1 of the pitfalls of a specialty recipe like this when made by a cook familiar w/the &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; is they are on &quot;auto-pilot&quot; &amp; do what they know to be best. I admit to revising your recipe w/the use of cream cheese. For the filling, I used 1 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream &amp; 1/2 cup cream cheese (same total volume as recipe, but reduces the mayo &amp; sour cream). For the &quot;frosting&quot;, I used a combo of mayo &amp; cream cheese w/only a sml amt of sour cream. When chilled, both chgs make the terta less fragile to decorate, slice &amp; serve. Using the curved jelly-roll-type bread limits how you can garnish, so I kept it simple w/a layer of cucumber &amp; egg slices on top &amp; tomato slices served to-the-side. Lastly it was sprinkled w/dry parsley flakes plus Old Bay Seasoning as a matter of pers pref. Bottom Line: We loved it &amp; our guests loved it too. Thx for inspiring me w/your recipe. :-)"
1802993024,504544,2014/8/3,0,"Sorry, didn&#039;t finish reading before I asked about baking. Anyway, at what temperature should they be baked?"
128473,514211,2014/6/2,5,"Thank you for sharing your lovely recipe Kate.  These pancakes were quick and easy to make with excellent results.  The pancakes were big, light, tender and fluffy, with a lovely baileys flavor.   I drizzled maple syrup over the pancakes then garnished them with raspberries and icing sugar.  So so good.  I can&#039;t wait to make these tasty treats again."
2001182097,528367,2016/9/25,5,"Made this and literally put it on everything, pasta included. Holds up in refrigerator for a month or more covered, got better with age on it."
1925885,522939,2015/8/5,5,"Very nice - a keeper!  I thought the ginger and mint would overpower the gin, but that wasn&#039;t the case. I did add a bit more yuzu to cut the sweetness, and it was tart and refreshing!  Even DH begrudgingly said he liked this &quot;chick drink&quot;. LOL.  Made for Culinary Quest 2015 by a Toasted Tourist."
560491,495667,2013/4/28,5,"This is my new go-to fried rice recipe!  Healthy and flavorful and the big bonus, DH loved it too (edamame and all)!  There is nothing I would change about it!  Going into my Best OF cookbook!!  Made for Spring Photo Tag."
37449,495667,2013/8/16,5,I really enjoyed this. It was filling and flavorful. I scaled the recipe back for one person and wished I&#039;d made more. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by one of the Hot Stuff.
131126,495667,2013/8/16,5,"This was nicely flavored, yet mild. It was a nice side for a baked Asian fish.  I used long grain rice and substituted peas for the edamame. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
266635,495667,2013/8/24,5,This is a delicious fried rice dish -- flavorful and it makes a really nice presentation.  Made as directed using organic edamame and one small addition -- I served a little sesame oil on top.  Served this with Asian lettuce wraps and what a wonderful meal it made.  Made for ZWT9.
174096,495667,2013/8/26,5,Great rice - we loved the addition of the edamame; very nice touch.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9
226867,504610,2013/9/24,5,"This was a delicious, different soup! I used craisins, apricots, dried apples from our tree, prunes and unsweetened grape juice. I&#039;m not sure what purpose was served by the addition of 1 Tb. of tapioca - it wasn&#039;t enough to thicken the soup, but I did enjoy eating the little &quot;dots&quot;! Couldn&#039;t find my star anise, so added a couple drops of anise extract. Probably wouldn&#039;t bother with that next time. I&#039;m looking forward to a bowl of oatmeal mixed with this lovely fruit soup!  Thanks, Mikekey - good luck to your Seahawks!"
37449,497751,2013/10/8,5,Very nice! I&#039;ve been meaning to try this drink. I used unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar. I felt like I was back in Little House on the Prairie days. Thanks!
128473,497751,2013/11/17,5,"Thank you for sharing this wonderful remedy Pammyowl.  It worked beautifully for me.  Quick and easy to make, with  great results.  You were right, you can feel when the allergy symptons come back.  I will be making this drink for years to come.  Each time I make it I will smile and think of you my friend. Rest in Peace Pammyowl, you will be missed."
135470,497751,2013/12/6,5,This was warm and soothing on a little bit scratchy throat. The honey and vinegar balance each other out nicely. I look forward to trying it when my allergies are acting up. Made in memory of pammyowl.
482933,497751,2014/2/2,5,What a relief to find an easy home remedy for on going sinus issues! Wonderful post that I will repeat.
2000579050,501506,2015/10/19,5,Thank you so much for posting this recipe! My mom used to make this for me when I was a little girl. I forgot how to make it and I&#039;m so glad I stumbled upon your recipe.  This is delicious!
2001090064,506978,2016/7/18,5,"I LOVE the Crispy Rice at Silk Thai, also! It was wonderful to find this recipe and attempt to replicate the experience. The recipe is very close. I added some Thai chilies, because we like spicy food, also, made the mistake of not allowing the rice/chicken breast mixture to cool before adding the remaining ingredients. Overall the flavor was wonderful, the rice was no longer crispy (my mistake). I will be making this again, with the change I mentioned previously. Great job on duplicating the recipe! Thank you."
1052873,498778,2014/4/22,5,"Very tasty. I used Christopher Ranch chopped jalepenos which are packed in oil, so I used a little less oil. I don&#039;t own a food processor, just a blender (I know, join the 21st century, right?), so I couldn&#039;t get it as smooth as store-bought but it was very yummy. Made for PAC 14."
1677099,492917,2013/1/7,4,"Delicate yet flavorful.  Had no vodka, used rum and think tequilla or gin would work.  No fresh dill, used dry.  Was way too thick so I used equal parts cream cheese and plain yogurt and lots more lemon juice.  Many changes, really tasty.  Everyone at 1st Friday dinner liked.  <br/><br/>8 oz cream cheese, 8 oz plain yogurt, 2 tbs rum, 4  tbs lemon juice-fresh, 2  tsp dill, 1/2 tsp salt."
2000819670,533951,2017/11/3,0,What is cookie butter?
2001659582,533951,2017/11/3,0,Where can one find mini Bundt pans?
2001390204,533951,2017/11/17,0,What is cookie butter?????
482933,505242,2014/2/25,5,Delicious! Hard to believe this is a weight watcher recipe. All the flavors come through. Like that the garlic is not roasting in oven with cauliflower as I find that is when you get burnt garlic. Used apple smoked gruyere and subbed in apple juice for wine. Cauliflower done in 20 minutes but it really depends upon size of florets. Served with ham. Next I would stir cauliflower half way through. Thank you Northwest Gal for sharing.
798181,505242,2014/9/25,5,"I really loved this dish! DH really dislikes cauliflower so I made it while he is out of town. I am pretty sure he will love it with all the flavors, cheese, garlic &amp; wine. Thank you!"
588188,512618,2015/11/30,5,"Delicious and wonderful. I made it just as described, and it was a hit! 
The next batch I added a small pinch of Kosher salt to counter the sweetness.
Both batches were great. 
I can see adding chocolate chips or coconut to boost the flavor.
All around a great recipe Corn Flake Candy!"
1803598119,520793,2015/1/27,5,"Super easy, tasty and if I can do it so can you!"
457316,529732,2017/1/20,0,This was lovely! A very nice flavor and consistency. I like the addition of cheese and bacon. Thanks!
37449,504644,2013/8/5,5,A delightful salad! Scrumtious flavors and loved the coconut milk with nutmeg and cinnamon. Made for the Caribbean dessert challenge for ZWT 2013.
480195,504644,2013/8/8,5,This is a delicious salad. DH absolutely loved it and asked me to make it again soon. I served it for dessert.
169430,498156,2013/7/2,5,"My single change here was to use crumbled veggie sausage patties because I love them and they sure save on the fat content. Really loved the fennel and artichoke and those flavors made this morning&#039;s breakfast sing with flavor. This is one classy, upgraded frattata, thats not hard to make and so easy to enjoy. Thanks Jen."
2002053137,534957,2018/3/15,2,This Cake was a hit with family and friends!
2001253391,534957,2018/3/23,4,I tweaked this recipe a bit by adding a chocolate mousse filling in between layers; however used the two buttercream flavors as a boarder. I also am not a real fan of regular graham cracker so I used the chocolate graham cracker and crushed it up. I'm a &quot;bake from scratch kind of gal&quot; so used my favorite chocolate cake recipe w/ 3 - 9&quot; round pans.... The cake was a Hit!!! I made it for my Birthday Cake and everyone wanted seconds!! Simply Fabulous. I will make this again some time and will rock it for sure 2nd time around!
1052873,503109,2013/7/27,5,"This was great!. I made half a recipe because the ice cream maker I have only makes one cup at a time, then you have to put it back in the freezer for several hours. I used sweet potato baby food for the puree."
340141,505677,2013/8/18,5,"Really delicious burger.  Moist, full of flavor.  If you have people in the family who can&#039;t eat spicy food, don&#039;t worry:  the siracha-mayo mixture isn&#039;t too hot, and you can always omit the jalapeno (or use a deseeded one).  I don&#039;t have a food processor, so I just minced everything.   It still worked great.  ZWT9"
1072593,505677,2017/1/12,5,yummp...yoood...eahhhh....I was just reminded that only at the dentist one may speak with one's mouth full. Gotta make this again!
315565,504246,2013/7/30,4,This is easy to do and very versatile. It cuts well when cools down too. I added two diced up pears and fold them through the batter. It was thoroughly enjoyable and I would certainly make again. I always have disasters flipping pancakes in a pan so I way prefer this baking method - way less mess !!!
383346,504246,2013/8/5,5,This baked pancake is so yummy.  I liked the texture and the taste.  I ate it with Blueberry and Mint salad on top.  So good :)  Thanks Miss Fannie :)  Made for ZWT9
498271,504246,2013/8/7,5,"This is a wonderful breakfast treat!  Mine puffed up nicely and had the texture of an egg custard with a nice slightly crispy crust.  I muddled some blueberries with some warmed maple syrup and served that on top.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
1925885,504246,2013/8/10,5,"Oh, baby!  Can I give this 50 stars???  This is the BEST Scandinavian style pancake I&#039;ve ever made or eaten.  Maybe it was the combination of the light and tasty pancake with the luscious Blueberry and Mint Salad I topped it with (thanks, Boomette, for the suggestion!).  Absolute heaven.  The pancake is just the right texture, and is perfectly sweet - in other words, not so sweet that you&#039;ll make yourself ill by putting on a sweet topping. Hubby is in the background right now, finishing off the last bites in the pan and the blueberry topping. All I hear are &quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;Om Nom Nom&quot;.  LOL!  Thanks Miss Fannie, for a fantastic recipe that&#039;s going in my Favorite of Favorites right now!  Made for team Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
128473,504246,2014/1/29,5,"Wow, wow, wow.  Thank you so much for sharing this lovely recipe Miss Fannie.  I love pancakes and these certainly do not disappoint. Quick and easy to make, this baked pancake  was wonderful; light, tender, custard like, with great texture and flavor.  Simply perfect served with blackberry maple syrup and a few fresh berries.  Easily one of the best pancakes I have tried on this site and believe me, I have tried many in the last 10 years. Kudos to you, I will be adding this recipe to my Favorites Cookbook for Best of 2014.  So thrilled that I tried these, made for Best of 2013."
1179225,504246,2014/2/2,5,"Delicious! This was a great breakfast for a busy Sunday morning when you want you something tasty, but need to get out the door and don&#039;t want to babysit pancakes. We&#039;ll be making this again. Thanks for sharing"
2001139370,504246,2016/10/3,1,This is the same recipe I found on Allrecipes.com and the biggest issue I'm finding with it is neither mentions the size baking dish to use. Wee bit frustrating
2697111,495221,2013/2/17,5,Great tasting and easy recipe! Taking it next time I need to bring a party dish!
486725,506039,2014/5/20,4,I used smoked paprika in this and it was the real star. Good to try a different kind of dipping sauce.
1802636110,514965,2014/4/1,5,LOVE THIS! Sweet potato plus New Orleans style = YUM! I did it with crawdads too!
1802636976,514965,2014/4/2,5,Awesome!
1802625199,514965,2014/4/3,5,"I&#039;ve got to say as a fellow chef this was pretty darn delicious!  Had to try it out last night.  Fixed some collard greens on the side and I must say it was easy, sauteed each item after one another to stack all those good flavors, and was impressed!"
1802639878,514965,2014/4/3,5,I&#039;m a guy and needless to say I don&#039;t always succeed in the kitchen.  I often look at recipes that are simple but packed with flavor...this was one that I was really happy with!  Made these for my girlfriend and I and we both loved it.  Now she&#039;s making smaller versions for appetizers for a party this Saturday!
1802641343,514965,2014/4/4,3,"LOVE southern food but hate the prep that goes with it.  This was easy, simple and flavors were incredible!!  Would make a great summertime lunch appetizer with a mint julep in hand!  Can&#039;t wait to make again for the 4th!!!"
1802641357,514965,2014/4/4,5,"The recipe was very easy to follow, as a 25 year old, that is necessary. &lt;br/&gt;It is a perfect dish. The shrimp combined with the tomato blew my mind, an amazing taste. &lt;br/&gt;An awesome combination, Am definitely recommending this to my friends back home in Wisconsin!!!!"
1802641380,514965,2014/4/4,0,Adult married male and have done a lot of cooking over the years. this was a very easy recipe to follow and turned out very well. Would recommend this recipe to anyone as to the ease of preparation and the outstanding outcome. I have used your site and others in the past in meal preparations and have been extremely pleased with outcomes.
8901114,514965,2014/4/4,5,Absolutely incredible! I love southern food and this recipe packs a flavorful punch that tickled all of my tastebuds. I can&#039;t wait to make this again over the weekend for all of my friends!
1802643348,514965,2014/4/5,5,I would&#039;ve never thought to put these things together... What a great surprise. It&#039;s a simple recipe but you can
1802646004,514965,2014/4/6,0,"Yum!!  Haven&#039;t seen green tomatoes in a recipe in a while!  Used tomatillos in this recipe a few days ago and they were a tangy, delicious addition to this southern surf and turf. Plan on making again when green tomatoes start popping up in a month or so. Very thoughtful recipe and blend of flavors were all out yummy!"
1802647699,514965,2014/4/6,5,Wasn&#039;t sure how these would fit but very pleasantly surprised!!!  Out of the box thinking or just  one of those &#039;putting stuff together in the kitchen&#039; days produces a real winner!!!!!!!   Kudos!!!
1802647620,514965,2014/4/6,5,Forgot the 5 stars on my review and this receipe definitely deserves them!!!

1802649497,514965,2014/4/7,5,Delish!!!!!
1802649569,514965,2014/4/7,5,Easy and delicious!!!
1802649573,514965,2014/4/7,5,Great recipe!! Super yummy! I would recommend to anyone I know :)
1802649653,514965,2014/4/7,5,It was really good.
1802649676,514965,2014/4/7,5,"Wow! I was able to make this one easily tonight at dinner. The boys and I really enjoyed it, we usually have sweet potatoes once a week or so, and this was a new tasty way to have them. And using the Simply mashed sweet potatoes made it really easy."
1802649705,514965,2014/4/7,5,"My dad and I made this with our dinner tonight. I like sweet potatoes, and really loved this dinner. I hope we make this again!"
1802649708,514965,2014/4/7,5,Unbelievable!! The combo of the sweet potato and the sausage was delish but the shrimp took it over the top!!! Soooo tasty!! Definitely going to make this one again!!
1802649713,514965,2014/4/7,5,A must make!! I love sweet potatoes and this recipe is awesome.
1802649716,514965,2014/4/7,5,"At first I wasn&#039;t thinking I was going to like this dish but the combination of the green tomato, sausage and shrimp was super delicious. It was the hit of my party! Great recipe!!"
1802649720,514965,2014/4/7,5,Wow! There are a lot of flavors going on with this one and they all work very well together. I made this as an appetizer before dinner. Dinner was anticlimactic. The appetizer stole the show.
1802649741,514965,2014/4/7,5,This was my first time cooking with green tomatoes and loved them! You can&#039;t go wrong with this recipe- easy and yummy!
1802649734,514965,2014/4/7,5,"Can i add an extra star to the ratings? Was a bit nervous with the choices off ingredients at first, but so delighted the way they all taste together. Will be cooking this for my in-laws this weekend! Amazing!"
1802649746,514965,2014/4/7,5,Awesome recipe! It&#039;s a must try. Love it.
1802650202,514965,2014/4/7,5,Great recipe. So yummy!
1802646216,514965,2014/4/7,5,Love The Combination Of Flavors. Gives Me The New Orleans Fix. Even My Picky Son Ate it. NowThats Something!
1802650237,514965,2014/4/7,5,Great combination and simple to make!
1802650340,514965,2014/4/7,5,Great recipe! Easy to follow and delicious!!!
1802650342,514965,2014/4/7,5,"Worth it just for the tomatoes. Seriously, I just want to eat these things all day. I&#039;ve made plenty of them in my time having grown up southern but the spicy element from the andouille along with that good fatty flavor hit the spot. Once I got done eating my tomatoes and had fried up another couple to actually make the sandwich I realized what love truly is. Great bit of caramelization on the cakes and crispiness from the tomato then that spicy sausage. I now know what Rick Astley was singing about"
1802650403,514965,2014/4/7,5,Love that it can be made small for appetizers or larger for meal portions.  And what&#039;s not to love about all those wonderful flavors!  Great job!
1802650762,514965,2014/4/7,5,"I&#039;ll have to admit, I generally avoid shrimp, as it doesn&#039;t do much for me. This one may change that for me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green tomatoes = simply amazeballz."
2156544,514965,2014/4/7,5,Made this as a recommendation from a friend and loved it! Great recipe!!!
636973,514965,2014/4/7,5,"I never would have thought to put all these ingredients together, but it just works! It&#039;s a southern spin on eggs benedict (on of my faves).  I love the mashed sweet potato cakes because they are yummy and gluten free! Best of all it is EASY to make."
1802650852,514965,2014/4/7,5,"This recipe provided an interesting blend of flavors that i never would have thought of myself, but it turned out really well.  Love the use of the mashed sweet potatoes as we keep hearing how healthy sweet potatoes are these days, not to mention they are incredibly tasty.  But combined with the shrimp, tomatoes and sausage this recipe is a real winner!!!"
1802652474,514965,2014/4/8,5,It&#039;s not everyday that my family will eat sweet potatoes; but this recipe definitely changed their mind.  It was delicious and very easy to make.  I think this makes for a delicous and healthy hearty snack or side dish.  Loved it!
1802652479,514965,2014/4/8,5,"I was a bit of a skeptic - not a big fan of sweet potatoes.  But no joke, this is truly one of the best recipes we have tried yet.  I was sold when I saw both shrimp and sausage included.  It was amazing - yum!"
2000127526,517991,2015/4/9,5,"This was absolutely delicious. I added the garlic salt before seeing the note about substituting fresh garlic, so I did that too. Next time I would add a couple cloves of garlic instead of one and keep the garlic salt. I also used a mix of brown and white rice, which was delicious, and added about 1/3 more rice than the recipe called for. I used about 1.5 cups of cheese, but next time I would make it more like 3/4 cup. Will definitely make this again."
1803067659,518055,2014/8/24,1,"I did not like this peach crisp at all.  I used fine cornmeal, as a reviewer advised, but I just did not care for the cornmeal-pine nut flavors with the delicious fresh peaches I was using, and it was too sweet even though I did reduce the sugar. I am tossing out this recipe and reverting to my traditional peach crisp!"
2001382137,534356,2017/11/20,1,"I am also too confused by the ingredients list. Currently as written, this recipe is not do-able. You list sugar in 2 separate portions AND one of the portions is a unit of measure of 'cup tbsp'??? What is &quot;1/2 cup tbsps sugar, 2 tablespoons sugar&quot;? Then in the directions, you only reference using sugar once by saying &quot;combine egg whites, sugar, and salt...&quot;, so which sugar measurement are you referring to or are you combining both?"
107583,494067,2013/3/25,5,A very hearty and tasty muffin.  Just the right amount of sweetness for us.  Wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Made for Spring 2013 PAC game.
128473,517416,2014/8/5,5,"What a terrific snack Anna, perfect for breakfast or lunch.  We enjoyed this tasty, on a piece of naan bread for a unique open faced sandwich.  The eggs are rich and creamy.  Thank you for sharing this quick and easy to make dish.  The dh loved it.  We will be enjoying this again and again.  Made for Culinary Quest - Russia."
47892,517416,2014/8/7,5,"The first question I asked myself was if I would miss the mayo. (No.) I browned the onions in the butter for approximately 10 minutes or until the onions were just starting to caramelize. That subtle taste of sweetness really enhanced the end product. I had some fresh dill on hand from our CSA box and added some to the mixture, too. Made sandwiches with salad greens for an easy dinner which included fresh fruit and cut up vegetables. Prepared for Culinary Quest 2014."
542159,517416,2014/8/8,5,"The thing that makes this egg so tasty is the same thing that makes the photo look funny, yes I am talking about that yummy browned onion. This was great atop nice whole grain bread, while I fallowed the recipe I did cut the butter just a little as we are trying to watch the cholesterol. Thanks for the post."
1802892051,517416,2014/8/8,5,"Delicious, A!  My first review for the Tour.  :)  This was a wonderful lunch.  Using butter instead of may brought back the memory that my Grammy used butter in her egg salad.  I mooshed my egg laden bread together for a yummy sammie.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!  xo Bethie&lt;br/&gt;Made for Cruisin&#039; Culinary Queens :)"
174096,517416,2014/8/14,5,Easy and filling! Also nice for supper with a light salad. Thanks for sharing! Culinary Quest &#039;14
724631,517416,2014/8/14,5,"Delicious!  I followed the recipe as written, but scaled down to 1 egg.  Because the recipe didn&#039;t specify butter for sauteeing, I used a small nonstick pan, and saut&eacute;ed until my chopped onion browned a little.  Then with the pan off heat, I added the salt, pepper, and (unsalted) butter, so that the butter would melt before adding in the chopped egg.  With that method, the butter did not burn and remained sweet.  We&#039;re not big fans of mayonnaise in this house, but we do use butter.  Since I often have a hard boiled egg and some toast in the morning, I think I have found a delightful treat that fits within my diet!  Prepared for Culinary Quest 2014 for Russia."
2000431901,527005,2016/7/18,2,This made WAY more cinnamon sugar for the top than I needed. Also the flavor was just &quot;meh&quot; to me. Might have been good with some strawberry jam in it or something.
2001131174,527005,2016/11/20,1,"Pillsbury has NOTHING to do with churros YUK! I do like like the mash up idea, if you want quick at least buy real churros and then make this adjusting cinnamon and sugar."
2794162,499088,2013/4/21,4,"I thought that this was a great recipe! Better perhaps as a brunch dessert, however. I had to use a few substitutions, such as plain sliced white bread, but it was fine. There wasn&#039;t really a need for the cream or vanilla essence, and I had a lot of trouble getting the cornflakes to stick, which was a problem. All in all, though, a lovely treat!"
2001788601,533192,2017/11/11,0,This recipe looks very good However is the onion - a 1/2c thinly sliced or a whole half of a red onion??
2302863,513545,2014/10/13,5,"I&#039;m on a diet so I left out the mozzarella, but I pumped up the low fat parmesan cheese. Holy cow! So good and filling with practically no calories! Making the zucchini like spaghetti is really a major key to fooling your brain into thinking you&#039;re gorging on pasta! This is SO my new go-to diet food/comfort food! Just in time for winter!! Thanks so much for posting!"
437598,513545,2015/11/22,5,"This is delicious. Didn&#039;t have any seafood magic so I used old bay. I also added an onion, green pepper, and topped it with pepperoni just like a pizza. My daughter and I just loved it, and it is low carb. Thanks for the recipe."
379033,508926,2014/2/17,5,"Thank you Lige68 for this recipe. I had on hand McCormick&#039;s Barbeque rub. I mixed that with the brown sugar. I loved the butter in this. I rubbed the ribs with the butter, then sprinkled on the spice mixture, then I sprinkled on a small amount of red pepper flakes. I let it sit on the ribs for about 6 hours, then baked per directions. I added the Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s BBQ sauce, because that is the only sauce I use. DH and I were very happy with this recipe."
666681,513635,2014/5/5,3,"I liked the concept of this recipe, it&#039;s the best of both worlds, cookie and cheesecake. I did modify this recipe by excluding both the caramel and toffee chips. After measuring out all the chips it was 1 1/3 cups to 2 cups of binding ingredients like flour. For fear of this being a gooey mess I just used 2/3 of a cup of the mini chocolate chips. I would suggest only using 2/3 of a cup of either the mini chocolate chips, or toffee chips, or Carmel bits. Everyone who tried this liked it. Nice, moist, however rich. I wasable to get 16 servings out of this recipe. Thank you for the recipe. Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
2324285,499890,2013/5/28,5,"A very nice dish, although the recipe was a bit difficult to follow.  I figured it out though.  The quiche itself almost tastes like an exotic sweet potato pie, and you really need the lime juice and chili peppers on top- they add so much to the flavor.  Loved it."
2324285,507052,2013/9/22,5,"Really Good!  This tastes like a burger, but in meatloaf form.  I was skeptical about the evaporated milk, but it makes the meat very moist and juicy.  A winning recipe."
1800199313,507052,2014/1/12,5,"This was really good and my kids loved it! No leftovers! I had to cook it longer than 20 minutes though, about 45 minutes. I recommend using a spatula to hold the pie in place while draining the grease."
128473,494568,2017/12/23,5,A new family favorite. Awesome cookies FEM...
2000721616,524868,2015/11/30,5,Can&#039;t wait to try this out - looks so yummy and relatively easy too!
2000739824,524868,2015/12/11,5,Delicious! Great addition to my list of easy go to recipes!
2000740004,524868,2015/12/11,0,I tried this last night and it was VERY easy to make and my family loved it!
2000742312,524868,2015/12/12,5,This was very easy to make and very tasty!!!
137854,525929,2018/3/19,5,"The family was not disappointed! Thank you! (I added walnuts, but would def not do so again. Tempered the mild sweetness too much.)"
1269180,512463,2014/2/12,5,Amazing! Sweet and caramelised from the sweet potato meets the peppery taste of the chorizo and it&#039;s perfect! We diced our chorizo finely because the skins wouldn&#039;t come off but it was still great!
50509,512463,2015/3/12,4,"We really enjoyed this. I used all the ingredients except only 10 ounces of chorizo and half the tortillas. I omitted the salt and it is still a bit salty for our taste (chorizo tends to be salty). I would add another sweet potato to this, as I think even with my reduced amount, there would have been a better balance of sweet potato and chorizo that way. UPDATE: I have been making this with more sweet potato, and that really works out well for us - I think that the balance between sweet potato and chorizo is better with more chorizo. I love how easy this is- the chorizo provides all the seasoning you need, so it&#039;s so simple to make for weeknight dinners."
486725,512463,2016/11/28,5,"Boy, are these yummy! I used leftover plain sweet potatoes that had been roasted in the oven, omitted the salt, and added about half the chorizo, since ours is really spicy. These tacos are such a perfect combination of sweet, spicy, creamy, tart and crunchy. Definitely a new favorite!"
498271,512447,2014/4/23,5,This is a wonderful soup!  The toasting of the pasta is what made this great; I used orzo pasta and the results were terrific.  I did add some corn as you suggested and a generous dose of Tabasco.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2014
653438,512447,2014/4/28,5,Made for Spring PAC 2014 and this is a tasty soup.  Like &quot;loof&quot; I used orzo pasta and added corn which we had some left over from another dinner.  So light and easy.  The only thing I did differently was that I had two large roma tomatoes that I used  and added some jalapeno to the mixture in the blender.  Next time I think I will add some shrimp towards the end.  Served this with recipe#245601#245601 and we had a great lunch.  Thank you for posting.
236262,494235,2013/10/11,5,Delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written. Used hot pork sausage which gave it the perfect zing to bring out the sweetness of the squash. One note... my acorn squash was BIG so it took twice as long to cook as the recipe called for. That shouldn&#039;t be a problem most of the time.
938339,499360,2014/4/21,5,I&#039;ve made these twice now they are so good. Slice your potatoes real thin so they get done.
47559,503828,2013/7/21,5,"This is a great gumbo!  I hadn&#039;t had one with tomatoes before, and really liked it.  DH is not a fan of okra but he loved it.  The okra was cooked so well, both before adding to the gumbo and then simmering for a long time afterwards, that it mostly dissolved right into the gumbo adding great flavor and losing any off-putting texture.  I&#039;ll make this one again.  Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers for ZWT9."
42459674,503828,2013/9/20,5,The Gumbo I Make is real real close &amp; real real Good Good Job
2727323,497162,2013/3/11,5,Fantastic. I have a terrible time getting my son to eat veggies. He gobbles these up and has no clue it contains potatoes.
2734801,497162,2013/3/13,0,Looking forward to trying these this weekend.
1706426,504819,2013/8/3,5,"Absolutely delicious! I have never made deviled eggs with butter before, but they were perfect. I also loved the dill on top. I did add celery salt, force of habit! Made for ZWT9"
80353,504819,2013/8/4,5,All-out delicious.  I should have made a double batch.
440735,504819,2013/8/5,5,"These were super yummy! I have never tasted Jarlsberg cheese so I was excited to make this! I had to use dry dill because DH forgot to get the fresh at the store.  IMO, fresh dill needs to be used in this dish. Made for ZWT9 for the Gourmet Goddesses July 2013"
174096,504819,2013/8/6,5,"What a nice change for deviled eggs!  The Jarlsberg and ham were tasty, and the butter provided a nice mild flavor and a slightly different texture than the mayo-based ones to which we are accustomed.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
1925885,504819,2013/8/7,5,"I&#039;m not a deviled-eggs fan, but these were excellent!  It must have been the butter...  I made these for a neighborhood brunch and everyone loved them.  My camera battery died, but I&#039;ll post a pic next time (and there WILL be a next time!).  Made for team Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
610488,504819,2013/8/7,5,I mixed the dill in the stuffing mixture and it made the cheese flavor really perk up and shout out loud! Will recommend to everyone I know!
895132,504819,2013/8/11,5,"Simple and utterly delicious! I also mixed the dill in the stuffing (only because I didn&#039;t realize that it wasn&#039;t meant that way), and it was awesome. Thanks for posting!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Scandinavia for The Apron String Travelers"
296809,504819,2013/9/1,5,"Made for a fellow Goddess of ZWT-9 &amp; Family Picks, DH &amp; I are big fans of devilled eggs &amp; I have made new fans of our Icelandic friends &amp; family in my time here. Like other reviewers, I added dill to the egg yolk mixture &amp; to the surface as directed. They were otherwise made as written &amp; they are special for the genre. The use of butter vs mayo produces a rich flavor &amp; texture when combined w/the cheese &amp; ham. I served them to dinner guests as part of a multi-recipe starter tasting-plate &amp; was a proud hostess. These eggs are at least a tie w/another recipe for our favorite of the genre. Thx for sharing this sure-to-be-repeated recipe w/us."
169430,506680,2014/4/14,5,"I made the small version of this smoothie this afternoon and it was a real treat. It&#039;s everything you would expect from the ingredients and is purely delicious. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
461834,502920,2013/7/15,5,"Wonderful biscuits!!!  I really think that returning the biscuits to the refrigerator to chill really makes a difference in the flakiness of the biscuits.  I made 1/2 of the recipe (used the other 1/2 of egg for a eggs benedict lunch) and it made 11 biscuits.  While these were baking, I could just smell a wonderful buttery smell and couldn&#039;t wait to eat them, very fluffy and tender!!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
400708,502920,2013/10/16,5,"twissis you&#039;ve done it again; a great recipe!  It&#039;s a little more work than the ones I usually make but the end result is a high rising, light and fluffy biscuit that was enjoyed by all in this house.  I made only half the recipe, but used the whole egg and it was no trouble at all.  Loved even the looks of this recipe."
219653,520088,2014/12/22,0,"This recipe calls for walnuts and the instructions say Pecans..I gess you can use any ol nut you want to, hey?"
8629,513127,2014/2/20,5,"These are very comparable to the Ruby Tuesday biscuits.  Actually, better because the ones I had at Ruby Tuesday were about the size of a quarter!  Not mine, however, I divided the dough into 12 equal parts and got a nice size biscuit.  At that size, I did need to bake them about 7 additional minutes in order to get them golden brown.  I think next time I&#039;ll divide the dough to make 15 smaller biscuits.  I thought the garlic flavor was very well balanced.  Not too much, not too little."
1379390,513127,2016/4/19,5,"I&#039;ve never had Ruby Tuesday&#039;s biscuits so I can&#039;t comment on the similarity to those...but as a cheddar cheese biscuit these are fantastic.  They are flaky and full of flavour, and are easy to whip up.  I like that they don&#039;t call for Bisquick, an ingredient that isn&#039;t available where I live.  I made about 10 large biscuits and cooked them a bit longer than suggested because they were so thick.  These were great fresh from the oven and also cold the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
461834,505600,2013/8/19,4,"After trying the Beignets in New Orleans a couple of years ago, had to give this one a try!!!  I made 1/4 of the recipe, which was 1/2 cup + 2 TBSP flour to 2 TBSP water, which didn&#039;t turn out to be a thin batter at all, was still crumbly and not all of the flour would incorporate, so I ended up doubling the amount of water, plus a little bit more to get a thinner batter as described in the directions.  Then the recipe worked out as stated in the directions.  The batter doesn&#039;t have any sugar, so it is more like the taste of bread, and then dusted with powdered sugar, so next time I would add some sugar to sweetened the batter for our tastes.  Thanks for sharing a fun treat from N. Africa!!  Made for ZWT 9."
2001841852,512762,2017/12/7,4,"A good recipe, which I will make again. I used tinned chopped tomatoes to save prep time. I would add more red pepper flakes next time, only to suit my taste. I served with whole wheat spaghetti."
107135,493594,2013/1/20,5,"this is a very nice banana bread , i did have to bake 15 more minutes  but i used a 9x9 which i felt did very well for the amount, the dough was thick and it rose very well. i did use a tablespoon of lemon juice which i always do when using baking soda  make this its good"
1677099,509459,2014/2/15,5,"I like this.  I used a combination of Sambal and Recipe #451867 for the chili sauce.  Then I used 20% less sugar.  This is nice, smooth and has just the right bite."
1706426,497606,2013/8/6,5,"I used dried apricots, I thought I had prunes, but sadly, no. I served it over brown rice, possibly my favorite food in the world! Also, I cut the vinegar back to 1 Tbsp. I am not a huge fan of savory dishes with sweet spices, so I skipped the cinnamon and cloves, but did use the nutmeg. Loved it, thanks for sharing! Made for Ramadan 2013"
169430,500442,2013/10/3,4,"I really liked this but DH wasn&#039;t thrilled with having veggies in his mac and cheese (remember, this is a man who still loves KD and wish&#039;s I&#039;d quit &quot;messing around&quot; with his Kraft standard of excellence so take his opinion for what it worth when it comes to mac and cheese). Even though I think he&#039;s nuts there may be others like him out there so I split my rating and his for 4 stars. So, moving ahead, I&#039;m quite happy to get extra veggies in pretty much anything and I really enjoyed this. A new take on something is always welcome to me. I really liked that the veg weren&#039;t over cooked and squishy. I would make this again for myself. :D"
37449,500442,2014/3/12,5,"I used whole wheat macaroni and almond milk, also cheddar cheese. I enjoyed all the veggies! I halved the recipe and now have lunch for tomorrow. Thanks!"
163112,508779,2014/4/24,5,"A winner of a salad!  So easy, so simple, so delicious!  I did use dried cherries.  I used a small shallot for the onion &amp; I sprinkled Romano on top for the cheese.  This will show up regularly.  I can&#039;t wait to try it with fresh cherries.  Thanks, CG!  Made for NA/ME Tag Spring 2014."
1802892051,508779,2014/7/6,5,"This is really good with dried cherries.  But fresh cherries it&#039;s ridiculously sublime!!!  The sweet cherries at the market were Northwest cherries from Washington.  Rem.Brandt is the company.  I&#039;m in heaven. Thank you, CG!!"

895132,517329,2017/10/8,5,"Wonderful Borsch! I grew up eating this soup, and I have made a lot of different versions now, but so far none which had the raw unpeeled beets boiled in the soup. It turned out very aromatic, very flavourful, maybe a little &quot;earthy&quot; compared to other versions. Very good! Thanks for posting! Made for Think Pink 2017"
47892,502123,2013/9/9,0,This *was* tasty and I really liked the flavor of the bay with the freekeh. What I didn&#039;t like and wasn&#039;t really expecting it to bother me as much was the color of the cooked freekeh. It was a drab green and it took a good amount of enhancement with colorful vegetables and herbs to make it more visually appealing and ultimately more palatable. It was an interesting detour and my first time testing freekeh and I know it won&#039;t be my last. Made for Summer NA*ME tag/2013.
926999,536610,2018/8/7,0,"Guess this is great if you have a food processor. Why not put that in the title so I don't have to waste my time on this recipe and could have searched another. EG: Miricle puff pastry if you have a food processor. You can leave out 'homemade', that's redundant. Obviously we are going to 'make' it. That's why we are on the site in the first place....duh."
1803581295,519965,2014/12/29,1,Calls for way too much yeast!!!!
93417,519965,2015/1/4,2,"Disappointing -- didn&#039;t rise, won&#039;t get done through, added a bit more milk after a couple of batches, which removed the yeastly taste, but still didn&#039;t cook through even with longer cooking.  Have been making waffles with another recipe without yeast, so was looking forward to seeing what this would do ....  Had the same recipe out of a magazine.  Think the recipe needs work, but might be good if someone revised it who has more ability to do that me!"
45944420,515539,2014/4/23,5,"I just made a batch of these biscuits and they are great! Used fresh mint, parsley, and Mexican tarragon from our garden but had to use a freeze-dried dill weed (Liteman&#039;s). Try &#039;em, you&#039;ll like the recipe."
169430,503675,2013/7/17,4,"Basically, I love the recipe. The single reason that I&#039;m giving 4 star&#039;s instead of 5 is that, for my taste, the spicing needs to be at the very least doubled it not tripled. It&#039;s very mild and I really loved it after a drizzle of Frank&#039;s Red Hot sauce. Having said that I have never tried Dirty Rice before and this could be the quintessential recipe and I&#039;m way off base. I will make it again with the spice elevated. It&#039;s filling, really tasty and I loved the shrimp addition.  Thanks so much Jan :D. Made for ZWT 9."
323186,503675,2013/9/2,5,"Mixed reviews,   my cousin and I loved this (we had seconds and finished it off), husband didnt particularly like it, but wasnt specific on why.   All I can say, well, WE liked it, made as per recipe, for me this would be a make again.   Oh, one thing, I did add crushed tomatoes .. hope you&#039;ll forgive me, I just felt I would enjoy tomatoes in this ....   really good, Jan, thank you, made for ZWT9, Family Picks, Pink Panthers"
560491,506864,2013/10/1,5,"Very nice marinade!  I used b/s chicken breasts since that is what was in the freezer, but this would be so much better on the thighs!  Gave it a nice teriyaki-like flavor that was not too salty or sweet. Made for My Three Chefs Tag."
350812,494737,2016/10/9,3,"This is a very nice, average kugel. I used goat cheese, and upped the za'atar to 3/4t. The tastes all blend together nicely, but I was looking for something where I could taste, or at least detect, the za'atar and I got none of that in this recipe. I'll likely make it again, but will increase the za'atar to at least 1t, if not 1 1/2. Issues with the recipe as written though....no cooking temp is specified!! I cooked mine at 350 and that worked just fine. Also, if I know I want to double the recipe, this doesn't specify the size bag of noodles I'd need...12oz or 16 oz."
736607,504013,2013/12/27,5,"Thanks so much for all of your sous vide recipes - I do not use my sous vide cooker often enough, because I always love the outcome. Your instructions for use are spot on."

1803701766,507923,2015/1/24,5,"This was delicious (especially the sauce) and easy to put together.  I did have to braise the chicken much longer than the recipe stipulates (about 45 mins.).  I served it with rice pilaf and asparagus lightly sprinkled with goat cheese.  It met with rave reveiws from my husband--I intend to make it again, and would confidently serve it to company."

560491,511941,2014/5/4,5,Great technique for making plain rice!  It came out nice and fluffy and perfectly cooked.  It dried up but didn&#039;t stick to the bottom or burn.  Will be using this method when I need white rice.  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
684911,511941,2014/9/9,1,"Total, gloppy fail. Chinese white rice is not complicated but this recipe is way too free-form. It&#039;s downright reckless. I&#039;ll use the epicurious recipe next time or just my old fashioned &quot;American&quot; White rice recipe. Sorry AZPARZYC and allypal but skip this one!"
1803131704,511941,2014/9/13,1,Worst way to make rice . horrible.
2001069033,511941,2016/6/30,5,"If done right, it is a wonderful side dish"
2001799006,511941,2017/11/16,5,"Towards rose198705 and gcherrits, the problem you both seem to have concerning goopy gluey rice lies in the starches. Removing most of the free starch when washing the rice is insanely important. Likewise, lowering the heat part way through the cooking process helps. While it isnt mentioned here, allowing the rice to rest off of the heat before fluffing acts like insurance. That rest period sets the remaining starches in the rice grains, giving you the desired end product. &lt;3"
461834,537241,2018/11/12,5,What a wonderful flavorful and moist bread!!! I made 1/2 of the recipe and kept the frosting on the side. I tried it the day I made it for breakfast and then froze slices to have in the future for breakfast or a snack. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!!

220348,495343,2013/3/1,5,"I really do love this recipe! I love the blend of herbs and vegetables, especially the mushrooms. This was a great way to enjoy all the ingredients, and because my family loves cabbage rolls this became a big hit in the house."
160977,495343,2013/3/1,5,"This was delicious! A little bit of work but as the rolls also freeze well it was worth the effort. We quite often eat cabbage rolls and this will certainly be added to the different filling for these rolls.<br/>I baked the rolls a little longer, nearly 30 minutes as we like the cabbage to get really soft. Will make again and then also try with honey and/or brown sugar.<br/>Thanks for creating, posting and good luck in the competition.<br/>Made for Dining on a Dollar, Spring 2013."
1037138,495343,2013/3/2,5,Sorry!  I meant to rate this a 5 star recipe and forgot to mark the stars!
963934,495343,2017/1/19,5,"These are terrific. As I didn't have the vegetables listed on hand, I used another combination of chopped vegetables totalling 4 cups (extra bits of cabbage, broccoli, peppers, carrot). The sauce really makes them special and the bulgur gives them a &quot;meatiness.&quot; Thanks so much Sharon."
1803223445,510941,2014/10/13,4,"Followed the recipe except I used Cup4cup gluten free flour blend. Also, I reduced the amount of sugar added by 1/4. Finally, I dumped in some semi-sweet chocolate chips in the final batch. These came out very cake-like, but that is how I remember pumpkin cookies being in the gluten-filled world.  I like how simple this recipe was and how they tasted a lot like the cookies from before."
2000677292,510941,2015/11/26,5,"These cookies are amazing!! I used Bob&#039;s Red Mill 1:1 Gluten Free Flour, added 1 package of vegan (+GF) chocolate chips, and made sure to cream all the wet ingredients together as you would any cookie recipe. The cookies were moist and fluffy! The family loved them!

I also made these with margarine instead of butter on the 2nd time around and they were just as good!

Now that I have a fantastic cookie that I can make GF and Kosher Parve (no dairy), I plan on making these often!"
242766,516849,2015/12/1,5,"It doesn&#039;t get any easier than this!  I loved spiced nuts, but most methods can be a little time consuming having to stand over the stove while constantly stirring to prevent scorching the entire batch.  This recipe makes quick work of the whole process and produces delicious results. These nuts didn&#039;t last long in my house.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  It is a keeper!  **Made for 2015 Football Pool**"
1328098,504685,2014/12/7,5,Love this homemade veggie bouillon. I was looking for an MSG free bouillon at the store and had no luck. Found this recipe and won&#039;t go back to store bought again. I store mine in the freezer in a small mason jar. Easily scoop out what I need for each recipe. You definitely need an 8 cup food processor. I only had a 6 cup and pushed it to the limit.
2001331851,524458,2017/1/1,5,"It is a Southern tradition to eat Collard Greens and Black Eye Peas on New Year's Day for good luck in the new year. On this New Year's Day 2017 I was looking for a vegan version of traditional Southern collard greens and this recipe really came through. Being a Carpetbagger from New York (37 years in the South) with a mother raised in Eastern Europe, I do not have any traditional family recipe for collard. So when I read Cherise saying that this was &quot;pretty close to the way my mom makes hers,&quot; I was sold on trying it out. Instead of using a pan and a crock pot, I did the whole thing in a cast iron Dutch Oven on a gas stove, turning the burner down as low as it goes for the three hour cook. I also used raw apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar to add some extra flavor. The taste is really good and I will be making these again before the next New Year's day. They are too good to eat just once a year."

My guests enjoyed in particular the cheesecakes that were garnished with maple-caramelized bacon; the sweet and savory combination provides a very nice complement."
2000515090,523675,2015/10/2,5,"Great and simple recipe! Easy to follow. Baking the crust twice does wonders. 
Cheesecakes turned out great, both in presentation and taste!"

227978,502716,2015/1/2,4,"These tasted great, twissis!  The only thing we didn&#039;t care for was the texture.  The first step calls for boiling the potatoes first, then it&#039;s followed up with pan frying them, which I think the boiling made them a little too mushy for us. We did like the taste created from the combination of spices used in this recipe though, so I&#039;d definitely make this recipe again and skip boiling the potatoes first and just jump to the step of frying cubed potatoes (unpeeled).  Thanks for a great recipe, twissis."
92006,502716,2017/8/18,4,I boiled these potatoes until they were still crisp so that try wouldn't be mushy. We liked them but next time I might reduce the cumin. Served with a sprinkle of paprika for garnish. Thanks! Made for CQ '17
2324285,502269,2013/7/9,5,"I love this drink because it&#039;s so different!  It&#039;s spicy and fizzy, so it&#039;s great for a hot summer day.  The limeade tastes great with some tequila as well.  The sliced peppers were my favorite part, and would not leave them out EVER. They even are good to eat after soaking in the limeade for a few days- YUM, like jalapeno candy! [Made &amp; Reviewed for PRMR]"
128473,502269,2014/3/4,5,"Wow, Anna, is this good.  I am sitting here enjoying it as I type your review.  So much flavor, it is light, refreshing, spicy, hot and slightly sweet.  So very yummy.  I just realized that I forgot to rim the glass in brown sugar, no worries I have lots left, can&#039;t wait to try it with the sugar added. Did I mention that it was quick and easy to make also.  I made it and let it sit in the fridge for two days, that was the hard part.  Was it ever worth the wait.  I love limeade and this one gets 10*&#039;s from me. Thanks so much for sharing gf.  Made for Best of 2013."
37449,502269,2014/3/10,5,I love ginger and limeade so I knew I would enjoy this sweet tart drink.  I did leave out the jalapeno. Much appreciated! Made for the Best of 2013 game.
400708,502269,2014/3/18,5,"The hardest part of this recipe was waiting on it in the fridge, loved the fizzy, sweet, tart, spicy kick that came with it.  I did reduce the calories a bit by using only 1 tablespoon of honey (I didn&#039;t want it to sweet) and used reduced calorie brown sugar.  It still came out great.  This is a drink jumping right into my Best of 2014 book.  Made for March - Limes Community"
1783373,502269,2014/3/23,5,"This drink is definitely a creative tasty drink.  It&#039;s pretty different than any others I&#039;ve tried and the funny thing is that I didn&#039;t add alcohol, but there&#039;s something in the background that tastes like there&#039;s slight alcohol tones (maybe it&#039;s wishful thinking).  Very enjoyable for this Saturday night and I&#039;m enjoying myself.  Thanks Annacia for a nice experience!"
1706426,501493,2013/8/4,5,"Mmmm, oh so good! I am a coffee freak, so this was a perfect fit for me! Thanks for sharing, made for ZWT9"

37449,501493,2013/8/5,5,"I used decaf and really enjoyed the flavors. I wasn&#039;t sure how I would like this, but it&#039;s good and like Annacia said, makes me think of the tropics! Made for ZWT 2013."
169430,509615,2013/11/22,5,"I must say that the intro is correct. Myself being a mere woman I was actually able to make this hearty soup all alone! LOL. I chose a mix of red, black and white beans and used veggie stock in place of chicken, it made a great lunch with fresh hot whole wheat biscuits. DH really enjoyed it."
285039,494403,2013/5/19,5,"Enjoyed this full flavored Certified Angus Beef flank steak, even though it didn&#039;t marinade as long as suggested.  It got gobbled up so quickly, I almost missed snapping a photo of it!"
679953,494403,2014/11/11,5,"So I made an hour drive to Chicago last week, to get my months worth of meat, at a wholesale place including 5 pounds of these steaks.  The only thing I did was used 1 tablespoon pepper, and 3 cloves.  Cooked these medium, and very enjoyable.  The marinade is above great, very good, as I marinated them for about 6 hours.  Made for your win in Football Pool."
461834,494403,2015/10/4,5,"WOW!!!  This is so good!!  I really wasn&#039;t expecting to think this would be a favorite recipe for this year, but it is!!  I made this as written, although scaled back for 3/4 lb, and skipped the rosemary (not a fan what so ever of it).  I made the marinade, added the steak and then put it all in the freezer until the next afternoon.  I then brought it to room temp prior to grilling.  The combination of the vinegar, green onion, thyme, pepper and mustard is so good and flavorful.   This is a recipe that will definitely be used in the future.  I served it with some grilled onions, salad and garlic bread.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.  Congrats on your win in the football pool!!"
107135,506175,2013/10/1,5,"very nice recipe , i love sour doughs and this is a good one lol"
2000000998,506175,2015/5/31,0,I will  make this later when I have a couple of days with nothing pending. I love this bread and I love the way it makes the house smell. This bread &quot;lets&quot; you know you are eating bread and not something that looks like bread.
1678694,506175,2017/2/21,5,"Thank you for detailed instructions regarding making, using and storing the starter! Also nice to find a recipe that uses natural yeast from the environment, no store-bought yeast necessary. So far I've got my starter done.. 10 days fermented and looks great. Can't bake bread yet, so I'll store it in the fridge as you suggest, and come back with more comments after baking."

736607,518914,2016/2/8,4,"This was a great way to use leftover pulled pork.  I didn&#039;t have the cheese soup, but the sauce was cheesy and smooth.   I left the jalapenos on the side, given the kids don&#039;t like spicy foods.  A hit at the Super Bowl! Thanks for sharing!"
208230,505296,2013/8/7,0,Just a comment - commercial marshmallows are not vegetarian.
169430,508640,2013/11/6,5,"Simple and yummy. I used 4 good sized Yukon Golds and the celery soup option. I would use smaller spuds next time, not especially the tiny ones but something under nice baking size lol. Set on high for the full 6 hrs and I was getting a bit concerned when they were still as hard as when they went in at 4.5 hr mark. I just turned them over and put the lid back on. At 6 hrs they were cooked and I was able to smash them with a fork. The sauce is very good and there is a lot of it to go around. I used low fat soup so I feel pretty good about health factor here too. :D"
199848,508640,2013/11/8,5,"What a clever recipe!   These potatoes came out so soft, moist and creamy!  It&#039;s hard to describe.  They&#039;re much moister than a baked potato; more like fluffy moist mashed potatoes in the skins.  But not too soupy.  I used medium-sized russets, cream of celery soup and as per the recipe&#039;s suggestions, I added some chopped onions and a small can of sliced mushrooms (drained).  I&#039;ll be making potatoes this way often.  Thanx for posting this!"
628076,508640,2014/1/4,4,We liked these. I used a homemade soup mix and red potatoes we grew in the garden. I think these would be great with fresh potatoes that the skins just peel off. The kids didn&#039;t care for the skins but they were easy enough to slip off for them.
1783373,508640,2014/3/31,5,"I think these are pretty yummy!  I used cream of celery soup and also added about 2-3 teaspoons of onion powder.  Though I enjoyed this dish very much, I think next time I&#039;m going to add some finely grated parmesan cheese for an extra level of flavor.  It was a great accompaniment to a slow cooker ham.  The ease was fabulous, especially when I had to be out the whole day and my family and I came home to a pretty terrific meal that was enjoyed on a cold and rainy day.  You can&#039;t go wrong with these!  Thank you Sharon123 for sharing."
599450,503932,2013/7/22,5,"Wonderful! Made as directed! I forgot to peel the shrimp before cooking, though, causing quite a stir with picky DH. Will be sure to shell them the next time. Thanks, twissis! Made for fellow Gourmet Goddess teammate for ZWT9."
169430,506386,2013/9/21,5,"This is so good I think I could drink the whole batch at once. Well, maybe not at once, but I could make a pretty good dent in the overall amount :D. I didn&#039;t have any strawberries and used frozen mixed berries and that berry flavor comes through beautifully. Thank you for another excellent tea Sharon. I don&#039;t think that I could choose a single favorite out of your collection!"
280271,505931,2013/8/19,4,I always love the non mayo coleslaws...this one was yummy but I didn&#039;t taste the chili-garlic sauce which was a disappointment...next time I will double or even triple the amount to get that heat that was missing...over all an easy and tasty dish...thanks for posting it...=)
2701382,495706,2013/2/19,5,My picky family loved it.  Who doesnt love cheeseburgers.

266635,509914,2014/1/23,5,"This honey-sriracha chicken is really delicious -- made it for lunch today.  Great flavor with the honey and hot sauce drizzled over it along with the chopped cilantro.  The only change I made was to use whole grain toast and I reduced the sriracha sauce quite a bit as it is really very spicy to me.  This recipe is so easy to make and it&#039;s really filling for lunch or a light dinner.  Will definitely make this again!  Made for PRMR, January, 2014."

169430,505499,2013/8/17,4,"I only made 4 eggs and let them chill before adding the seasoning. They were part of a cold dinner this evening along with cold Recipe #505591 and purchased flat bread. These are tasty and while I love the concept of no mayo =less fat I find that in reality I prefer a little creaminess in the yolks. Thanks CG, I really enjoyed trying the recipe for ZWT 9. :D"

1801929064,507086,2014/1/5,5,"This recipe is clear, easy to follow and so successful!  What a lovely cake.  I decorated the top with some candied orange slices.  It looks great, and tastes  --delectable, de lovely, delicious!  &lt;br/&gt;An altogether yummy cake.   Thank you, Julie!"
2000703628,507086,2015/11/23,0,Absolutely gorgeous! A go to cake every time!
2001074845,507086,2017/5/26,5,Absolutely divine. Super moist. I served my cake with sour cream.
126440,500134,2013/5/13,4,"I made half a recipe but put everything in the AMB.  Very easy to do and dough was easy to work with, I just have to do better at rolling thinner.  I baked for 10 min and just had one hot from the oven.  It was still doughy even though they were nice and brown.  I did four with salt and two cinnamon sugar.  Anxious to try the others."
128473,495676,2013/5/9,5,"What a lucky cooking class Tink....you are a special lady indeed...this is a wonderful recipe.  Quick, easy to make, and so easy to vary with terrific results.  Made the dough exactly as written, but used toppings that my picky dh would eat.  I baked the pizza for 15 minutes in a 448 degree convection oven, turned out perfectly.  The pie was topped with a garlic and basil pizza sauce, Italian mozzarella, parmesan reggiano, italian herb mix, coarse sea salt, spicy pepperoni, thinly sliced tomato, sweet white onion and red and yellow sweet peppers.  What a treat.  Thank you for sharing a recipe, that I will make again and again.  The pie was delish, beautiful ingredients on a thin, crunchy crust, that was still tender on the inside....so yummy. Made for 2013 Variety Is The Spice Of Life Event."
1706426,495676,2013/5/9,5,"Very good!  I made the mistake of letting the dough rise too long on the pan, so I didn&#039;t get a thin crispy crust, but it was still good Also, I skipped the brown sugar I made mine half pepperoni and half Italian sausage, and we love extra cheese so I upped the amount Thanks for sharing! Made for Variety is the Spice of Life tag game"
804550,495676,2013/5/10,5,"EXCELLENT! My DH and I have lived in New Jersey most of our lives except for two-three years when we were first born. In New Jersey there is at least one pizza shop in every town and some towns have multiples. So we have been hunting over the many pizza dough recipes looking for one we like and this is the one. The only problem I had is I am inept when it comes to rolling out the dough into a pizza. After seeing everyone elses&#039; photos I had great expectations, but for me this dough was no different than any others I have tried to manipulate. My end result with the help of DH was less than perfect. However, thank you for posting such a great tasting pizza dough! Tink you are the best! My toppings consisted of marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese and sweet Italian sausage. Made for Variety is the Spice of Life 2013 Event."
865936,495676,2013/5/16,5,"WOW!  This was so quick and easy, at least once I remembered that the yeast is in the refrigerator!  Did I say that the recipe was easy?  Its quicker than ordering delivery and costs nothing to make."
695933,495676,2013/5/18,5,"5/12/13 This is a great lunch time or a light dinner pizza option, so fresh tasting and different! The grandkids and grant grandchildren enjoy the pizza as will and like to have some more for lunch no.2 is on for today!! I followed the recipe exactly except just a little less onion and I used dried basil and oregano and sprinkled generously! I add a combination of red and yellow tomatoes and sprinkled some Italian mixed seasoning on the top. Absolutely delicious! This clearly proves that you can teach an old dogs some new tricks!! The grandkids are asking for the recipe. THANK YOU !! for posting.  Made for the 2013 Variety is the Spice of Life event. Update 5/18/13 Spread onion and garlic on top of pizza crust and cover with mozzarella cheese. Top with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Cool a few minutes then cut and serve. 2 cups sliced onions - 2 minced garlic cloves - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes - 1/3 cup parmesan cheese - 3/4 cup grated mozzarella cheese. I DO like this Pizza a lot, Thank You - For the 2013 Variety is the Spice of Life event"
107583,495676,2013/5/23,5,"Great crust.  We like our crusts thin and this one worked great for that.  Dough was very easy to work with.  I divided the dough into three parts and made them &quot;rustic&quot; shaped.  I made the Margherita (with fresh mozarella) and made one with just olive oil, portabello slices, red onion slices (sauteed first) and chevre (goat cheese) and the third I topped with tomato sauce, herbs, salami, mushrooms, mozarella and grated Romano.  All three were delicious.  This will be my go to crust for thin crust pizzas."
2702088,495267,2013/2/24,5,Delicious!   My son loved this dish.
2723978,495267,2013/3/6,5,It's one of my favorite recipes.  It highlights the ranch and eliminates any fishy taste.  Definitely worth printing out and keeping on the fridge.
1706426,500146,2013/5/16,5,"I apologize for the horrible photo! This recipe is great and I will make them again, without a doubt."
226863,500146,2013/6/18,5,"Delicious!  I love burgers topped with sauteed mushrooms and swiss, so this was a recipe made for me.  I tried to stuff them too full, and next time I&#039;ll use more meat so the patties will be able to hold all that yumminess!  Thanks for sharing."
2002298335,535020,2018/10/31,0,"Made these paleo style. I subbed cassava flour for all purpose flour, arrowroot starch for cornstarch, avocado oil for canola oil, maple syrup for agave and used a blend of blanched almond flour+tapioca flour for panko. It turned out fantastic!! So rich, delicious and meaty. Next time I’m gonna try a combination of baking and air frying instead of frying in oil for an even healthier recipe."
2206320,494303,2013/2/10,5,That's my kinda pizza!!  YUM

140132,494303,2013/9/18,5,So yummy!  This is was easy to prepare and tastes like a specialty pizza you would pay big bucks for in the restaurant.  Thank you for sharing with us.  Delicious
841835,494303,2013/12/10,5,Yummy. I will make this again. I used a mix of fat free ricotta and ranch for the sauce with sliced garlic. I had a kale salad on the side. MMmmm Will make this again.
187738,494303,2014/9/12,5,Made this for a group lunch at worked and everyone LOVED it!  I used bacon bits because that was easy and what I had.  I also had guacamole as a side!
131126,495320,2013/3/2,5,"When cut there is a vanilla layer on bottom and a chocolate fudgy layer on top. This is a heavier sytle cake~ it reminded texture wise of pound cake. I would like to try it in a bundt pan. I can see where the recommended dark cocoa would be better.  I used regular and the layer could have used a tiny bit more ""oomph"", but it still tasted good.  Neither the ketchup or pepsi pop and overpower the other ingredients. Made for a birthday dinner and served with whipped cream. I thought the creativity on this recipe was stellar and each ingredient well placed.  The cake ended up in my top three of the contest recipes I tried. Good luck!"
679953,494166,2014/2/5,5,"WOW ! ! These had a nice zip.  Made this as written, though I halved it.  Baking / cooking time right on the mark, and made for a great treat with some pork ribs.  Great side dish, or appetizer.  Made for PRMR Tag."
107135,504435,2014/8/2,5,"ok bad picture , i know , but holy moly this is good  i LOVE the pairing of oyster sauce and shrimp and all the flavors of garlic and onion and pepper are awesome  make this one if you like stronger flavors"
128473,522732,2015/8/20,5,Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe JackieOhNo.  We really enjoyed the vegetables prepared this way.  Love the caramelizing of all the vegetables.  I did over cook them a little but they tasted great.  Made for CQ2 - Ireland
157425,522732,2015/9/10,5,Cant believe how good this was! I did omit the caraway seeds and couldnt find the small red potatoes so quartered the larger ones then cut into thirds. Served with an eye of round roast with mushroom gravy. Was a great lunch warmed up the next day! Made and reviewed for CQ 2015.
169430,506837,2017/4/2,5,Simply lovely. I used ancho powder and made it a main dinner salad simply by sauteing the kale and adding some sliced chicken breast. Thanks my friend for another excellent meal.
305531,494566,2014/4/11,5,These are wonderful! I made a couple of small changes by using mozzarella rather than Gruyere and green onions rather than chives because I had them on hand. Very simple and delicious. Thanks for sharing this great keeper. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
2000304082,506193,2015/6/29,5,This was great and really tasted like the Starbucks version. Only thing I did different was that I bought the syrup from Starbucks instead of Torani. My whole family loved it!
2000409813,506193,2015/8/17,0,"Is &quot;Lemonaid&quot; a brand name for a specific product?  Or do you mean regular old lemonade, any brand?"
333017,506193,2016/7/30,5,Lovely! I added about 2 T grated ginger to the tea bags and a bit more peach syrup! I also got my syrup from Starbucks. Very refreshing!
2000779570,522551,2015/12/27,5,so good! this recipe is better than the cook books
822358,511468,2014/1/2,3,"This was a good basic bean soup but I felt it would be helped a bit with a larger range of flavors.  I added one finely diced carrot, 1 tbsp sesame oil and 1 tsp soy sauce to the mixture.  I feel lucky already and it&#039;s only the 2nd of January!"
323186,505210,2013/8/13,5,"Indeed, a very easy and delicious muffin.   I whipped these up after work,  popped them in the oven before starting dinner.   I used regular flour,  not needing to worry about dietary allowances,  so I can attest that they work very well using plain wheat flour.  I have passed them around to colleagues and they have been judged excellent!   Thank you, Jubes, a quickly prepared sweet and healthy treat with a wonderful melding of apple, nut and coffee flavours!    Made for ZWT9, Express Round 2, Panthers On The Prowl"
133174,505210,2013/9/3,5,Made these yesterday for breakfast.  The recipe was reduced by half and I got 7 muffins and could probably have actually gotten 8 as some slightly overflowed the tins.  I did not have sorghum flour so I substituted teff.  I used a gluten free baking mix made by King Arthur Flour.  My milk choice was almond.  The grated apple makes them nice and moist.  Great flavor and leftovers freeze well.  Made for Family Picks during ZWT9.
679953,509897,2013/12/23,5,"First I did not know how large to make the balls, but I ended up with 20, fairly large pecan pies, and used chopped pecans.  Well, I used these today, at church, for a Sunday Brunch, I did manage to grab one, and the rest were gone in no time.  A real winner here, nice and filling.  They had great flavor, and just as good as the store bought, that are fresh made in the bakery section at one of our locally owned stores.  Made  for a great treat.  Made for PRMR Tag."
2000045537,509897,2015/3/6,5,"I all-way like to made the recipe once as written, the way the chef did it. Absolutely Delicious.. Couldn&#039;t have been happier with the way it turned out..and I&#039;ll be making this a lot more. YOU HAVE SUCCESS!! with me. 10 STARS!!! from me"
2767670,496998,2013/4/3,0,Sounds good - I&#039;d like to try these!
305531,493034,2014/4/15,5,TDF! This cake is so simple and absolutely delish! My grand daughter and I made it together this weekend. Our only problem was that we weren&#039;t sure whether it was supposed to be a layered cake or not. So we did layer it. Thanks for sharing this great keeper. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
47559,514620,2016/8/6,5,I selected this recipe for Culinary Quest 3. I'm so glad I did. It made a light but delicious lunch. The flavor of the sauce was great and I enjoyed all the stir-fried vegetables with the noodles. I plan to make this again.
2200921,518154,2014/8/27,5,Love this recipe
1803076717,518154,2014/8/27,5,Very creative! Yumm....
42262819,518154,2014/8/27,0,"Brilliant.....the pairing of goat cheese and walnuts...yum, the perfect amount of pasta with a wonderful sauce that won&#039;t leave you with that pasta coma feeling!"
2001731079,528565,2017/11/17,0,it says add nutmeg....not called for in recipe!! it does call for cocoa powder but does not add it in recipe anywhere!! plz help. they do look lovely and i wish to bake them. lindia
1800137914,497922,2013/10/20,3,"The ingredients are a perfect match for Old Chicago&#039;s pizza rolls, but I found the amounts to be slightly off. In the first batch I made there was too much ranch dressing. It made the rolls too hard to cut without them falling apart. In the second batch, I cut the dressing by half and the rolls held together well and still tasted great. I also found placing the rolls in greased muffin tins worked better than the sheet pan."
870705,497922,2013/10/27,4,"These tasted great......I was worried they might be too spicy but that wasn&#039;t the case.  I agree with the other reviewer that there was too much ranch dressing, that could be cut in half.  I had a little trouble in getting them to stay together when I cut them, they really spread on the sheet when baking.  We served ours with some marinara sauce for dipping.  Thanks for posting!  Made for My 3 Chefs 2013."
393721,497942,2014/2/23,5,"I&#039;ve made this twice now, once with beef bones and once with chicken bones.  For the beef bones, I did roast and add vinegar and made it in my crockpot on low for 48 hours.  It had a nice rich flavor and made my husband and kids drank it when we started to feel the onset of flu symptoms. Amazingly, none of us were sick more than a day and I partially attribute it to the broth.  When I made with chicken bones, I was feeling lazy so I didn&#039;t roast them first and I thought it still came out pretty good.  Very easy when you use the crockpot."
329753,497942,2015/1/6,4,Fantastic and very clear directions.  Thanks for posting!
1926335,497942,2016/8/1,5,I made this using short ribs because I didn't know what else to do with them. The first day I was skeptical but by the time 72 hours were up it was delicious. I used this for a cabbage ground beef soup and it was so good. I am now making a second batch using soup bones I am sure it will be equally delicious. I could drink this that is how good I think it is.
2001494710,497942,2017/4/20,5,"It was great! I didn't read far enough down to see where I could reuse the bones up to 6x though. :( I put my broth in pint jars in the refrigerator and scooped the excess fat off before using it. It kept up to 10 days this way. I used 2 cups a day and noticed, within a couple of days, relief in my joints. My broth is all gone. I can't wait to make more when I get back from vacation. I'm using store bought bone broth, in the meantime. I loved mine as it was much more flavorful. Thank you for the great recipe. I made one batch in a crockpot and one on the stovetop. I preferred the one made on the stovetop, but I also switched up some ingredients. I'll keep experimenting because of the health benefits. :) And it is so delicious!!! p.s. I also lost a little weight. Can't wait to see what happens in a few months. ;D"
1803434027,499302,2014/12/10,3,"I think this recipe would be better with big thick slices of toasted bread. I used regular bread and by the time I removed a hole big enough for the egg to sit in there, there wasn&#039;t much toast left."
1663024,493782,2014/11/15,5,"This is my first time baking graham crackers but will not be my last. This recipe is the one that I will always make! I was thrilled to find a recipe with whole grain flour and pure honey for the sweetener. I often use half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour for cookies because using all whole wheat flour usually makes them too dense. However, using 100% whole wheat flour for this recipe makes a wonderful graham cracker texture. For extra flavor, I stirred in one teaspoon of vanilla extract into the butter and honey mixture. Instead of greasing the baking sheet, I cut a piece of parchment paper a couple inches larger than my 17 by 11 inch baking sheet. On the ungreased parchment paper, I rolled the dough into an 1/8 inch thick, 16 x 10-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter, I cut twenty 4&quot; by 2&quot; rectangles by first slicing the dough into four 16-inch-long-strips; then, slicing across the strips to make four 4-inch-long-rectangles. Leaving the precut dough intact on the parchment paper, I placed the whole thing on my baking sheet and baked for ten minutes. Next, I transferred the parchment paper with baked dough to a wire rack. After cooling for two minutes, I gently pulled the rectangular crackers apart along the precut lines. They perfectly tore along the precut lines like a perforated stamp. Since the dough was still soft and pliable after being cooked, I thought it may need to be baked for longer. However, once the individual Whole Wheat Graham Cracker Cookies were fully cooled on the wire racks, they became crisp. My favorite way of eating graham crackers is dipping them in a tall glass of cold milk until they become almost soggy and then nibbling on them. Plus, they make the milk taste sweet like cinnamon and honey. Thank you, mommymakeit4u, for a healthy yet delicious cookie recipe!"
1277527,506799,2013/9/15,5,So easy to make and OMG good
400708,519887,2015/10/10,5,"I&#039;ve made this a few times before, but finally remembered to come by and right a review.  Great recipe for when unexpected company arrive.  Looks impressive and tastes better, I&#039;ve also filled it with taco meat and seasonings for something different -the possibilities are endless.  For this one I followed the directions and the only extra thing I did was brush it with an egg wash before baking to give it that shine.  I&#039;m always going to keep those crescent rolls on hand just for this great idea."
169430,513609,2014/5/4,5,"What great flavors here. I made this just by the recipe and wouldn&#039;t change anything (and I rarely say that!). I used a big Costco chicken breast so mine took a bit longer to cook but came out beautifully done, moist and delicious. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
2000406319,513609,2015/8/16,5,"This was a quick, easy and tasty recipe (surprisingly tasty, actually). I used two big cloves of garlic and although I loooove garlic the flavour was still very strong. I also didn&#039;t have shallots so I used a small brown onion instead and it was still very nice. My chicken didn&#039;t crisp up quite as nicely as the original recipe photo (in fact, lit looked like a bit of a brown oniony mess) but that didn&#039;t detract from the taste ;)"
1802711620,498022,2014/5/1,4,"This is a very tasty soup. I put the broccoli in at the beginning with the rest of the beginning ingredients-yum. Also, I would use 3 potatoes not two. Overall, a very tasty recipe."
383346,494378,2013/4/9,4,"DH said it was a little bland.  So next time I&#039;ll add cinnamon.  I baked it the time that you wrote and it seemed perfect.  It was golden and puffed.  I let it rest the 5 minutes.  When I inverted it and sliced it, it was too moist.  It was not perfectly baked.  So I had to cook the pieces separately in the microwave for 1 minute.  Next time I&#039;ll bake it 30 minutes or check with a knife inside.  Me and my son liked it so much with maple syrup.  Thanks Laura :)  Made for PAC Spring 2013"
1329848,494910,2013/2/7,5,What a great idea. Can't wait to make!
126440,500089,2013/5/23,5,This is so good but so beautiful.  Loved the cinnamon topping.  I will lower the heat for my oven as parts of the top were overdone but it is sooooo good. Be sure to roll it tightly because it opens up when you cut in half.
1802753534,515700,2014/5/19,0,Comfort food. Simple and delicious. Served it with crusty bread and crisp salad. Definitely a go-to recipe after a holiday ham dinner.
6651,500848,2015/2/25,5,Wow is this good.  I loved the flavors of tamari and almond butter.
323186,505110,2013/8/16,5,"Lovely way to prepare one of our favourite grains,  thank you Mikekey,  enjoyed for ZWT9, Hot Pink Panthers On The Prowl"
1925885,505110,2013/8/15,5,"Loved this!  I cut the recipe in half, since there&#039;s only two of us, but wish I&#039;d made the whole thing!  The color of the couscous is wonderful, due to the turmeric - and the lemon flavor is subtle and delicious.  Thank you for posting a great recipe!  Made for ZWT9."
329769,505110,2013/8/17,5,"Made and reviewed for ZWT9. Loved it - plain and simple to go with any Middle Eastern style meal. Served alongside recipe#290839 for a delicious meal. I used corn couscous as regular couscous is not gluten-free, but otherwise made as written. Photo to be posted - as soon as I charge my camera battery and can get it loaded."
452355,505110,2013/8/21,5,"Delicious couscous, and bright and colorful to boot!  I found it a little on the lemony side, DH liked it as is.  We served Recipe #582993 over it, which worked out great.  Thanks!  Made for ZWT 9."
67728,505110,2013/8/26,4,"I used this as the side to Recipe#427734 tonight. Very lemony (which we liked), but a little bit bland in comparison to the steak tips. I would definitely make this again, but I think I would serve it with a more mildly flavored main. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9"
539686,505110,2013/8/31,5,I love the simplicity of this couscous and anything with lemon gets my vote. Made for ZWT #9.
1675225,505110,2015/8/18,3,This was rather bland  for me.  I added chopped tomatoes to add a little more flavor.  Maybe chicken broth instead of water would add more flavor.
163112,500358,2013/6/21,4,We liked this very much!  Great flavor; very different.  The couscous is a cool idea &amp; works well.  Using the 8x8 pan was different as well but worked really well!  The chutney was ok.  I think it woukd have been better cooked in a wide pan of some sort OR stir almost constantly.  The tomatoes on the bottom got really soft while the ones on top were still intact &amp; hard.  :(  I also think it would work to saute the onions for a couple minutes before adding the rest.  I used shallots instead of red onions.  I will definitely make this again!  Made for NA/ME Tag June 2013.
47892,500358,2013/10/6,4,"I used currants in place of raisins and my own homemade ras el hanout. ~Tasty~ wasn&#039;t too thrilled with the &quot;stuff&quot; in the meatloaf however. ;) Served over whole wheat couscous and accompanied by lightly steamed broccoli, carrots and cauliflower. I used half ground lamb and half ground beef. Made for NA*ME tag/October."
1925885,501854,2013/10/10,5,"When I asked DH what he thought of this, he said &quot;quite tasty, think I&#039;ll have another!&quot;  And he did. Twice. His third helping was just for research purposes, to see what it would be like with a drizzle of bourbon over the top. He says five stars - and I agree!  This is an excellent crisp, and the bourbon cream is delicious.  I personally think the small portion was perfect, but DH insists it needs to be a larger serving. Either way, you can&#039;t go wrong. Thanks for posting!  Made for My 3 Chefs 2013."
462861,501854,2014/11/16,1,"I tried making this last night and it came out very runny. I am not sure what I did wrong, but it looked ok until I added the bourbon and that seemed to make it very soupy and it didnt thicken up or evaporate much in the oven. It tasted ok, but the consistancy just kinda ruined it for me."
2197802,500226,2013/10/6,5,"I added a teaspoon of Parsley to my mix. I also used non-stick butter spray instead of parchment paper- which turned out to be a great choice. I used mozzerella cheese which also worked well. My crust was browning at 35 minutes. In really appreciated the tip to use a processor to dice the raw cauliflower ( I used a Ninja) - and also to wring the water out with a towel. I&#039;m sure this made a crisper crust. When I made the pizza, the crust was browned, but not crispy. Still- it tasted great! I will make this again!"
1794330,500226,2014/5/6,5,"This was pretty good. I added a dash of italian seasoning and some garlic salt. I also used a shredded pizza blend of cheeses. It should be noted that the idea of wringing out the excess water is a great idea, but do realize you are handling boiling hot product! I actually laid the towel in the strainer then after the cauliflower drained I wrapped it up and used a cup to press the water out."
1802863127,500226,2014/6/27,5,"This is fabulous crust. However, the original recipe by Detoxinista calls for only 1/3 cup goat or other soft cheese.  Making it with a full cup of cheese would likely not produce the correct consistency for a firmer crust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://detoxinista.com/2012/01/the-secret-to-perfect-cauliflower-pizza-crust/"
1268121,500226,2015/1/12,5,Yummy! I used all the tips above with straining and non stick spray worked fine. I used ground oregano a little granulated garlic for spice. Also just used Mozzarella b/c it&#039;s what I had. Worked fine. Thanks for the great recipe! :)
1800243352,500226,2016/10/12,5,"Thank you for the recipe, this is excellent pizza crust and actually tastes great -- no &quot;veggie&quot; taste! I used shredded mozzarella cheese as it was the only &quot;soft&quot; cheese I had on hand. I also used way more spices than the recipe called for, but that was just to my own personal taste and doesn't reflect on the recipe. Thanks so much for the suggestion of wringing the cauliflower out, it worked perfectly! I will double the recipe in the future as I think I made the crust too thin... My other half is diabetic was so excited to actually be able to have pizza and put so many toppings on I think he over did it; the crust wasn't thick enough to hold up on his half of the pizza, but it did great on mine (he liked it so much though that he wants to make every Friday &quot;Pizza Night&quot; :) Thanks again!"
2001979462,500226,2018/2/7,1,"I'm confused, your previous recipe which I made last week Called for a third of a cup of goat cheese, now you're saying to use one cup. That's a big difference, now I'm not sure what to make. old recipe said two pounds of Cauliflower now you're saying 4 cups which is one medium head. Your old recipe said 2 pounds of Cauliflower which I had to weigh and realized it's going to be two heads as each one weighed just about a pound . And it still wasn't much in the end. Now your new recipe says four cups, which is the equivalent to one head as your recipe says. So it seems like it's less Cauliflower and a lot more cheese. I'm confused about your amount of ingredients on Cauliflower and cheese how can I change so much from one recipe to the other? This is why I'm giving it one because it's very confusing ."
318262,504547,2014/6/16,5,These were wonderful and so easy for enchiladas! I mashed my beans lightly and used a homemade enchilada sauce but these were my only changes. Topped with avocado and fajita veggies as suggested. The filling was just slightly creamy and very hearty. Thank you!

2002091119,534956,2018/4/1,5,Perfect. I let the mousse cake set over night and the glaze in the fridge for the same time. I heated to the recommended temp and poured over. So please with how it worked out.
2875144,512106,2014/5/10,5,Really delicious and easy!  Had to make it without the wine since I did not have any.  Added fresh rosemary.
47892,501722,2013/6/23,5,"You&#039;re right-this was quick and easy. First I drained a can of organic garbanzo beans. I used rice bran oil instead of olive oil (I never use olive oil any higher than medium heat). Subbed fresh ginger for dried and cumin seeds for ground cumin. A mix of black and yellow mustard seeds as well. Served over homemade corn tortillas with a scoop of leftover basmati rice, the beans, a dollop of plain yogurt and the fresh cilantro! Yum! Made for Veg Tag/June."
474367,501722,2015/8/31,5,Easy to prepare and very flavorful.
865936,501156,2013/6/21,4,This is really sweet and delicious.  Just be sure your chicken is not too thick. Mine was and the coconut started to burn. I popped it into the microwave for a minute which cooked the chicken through. Aaaaarrrr!  Who wouldn&#039;t want Pirate Chicken!
2001065990,527352,2016/6/27,5,What a delicious snack replacement! Definitely replaces that urge to eat a whole block of chocolate...

1226388,503059,2013/8/4,5,"Oh wow!  This was really good!  It is kind of like a spicy Banana Foster, but different.  Lime is one of my favorite flavors and it was a great addition here.  I had it with ice cream and a sprinkle of coconut.  Made for ZWT9"
204024,496553,2013/4/13,4,"Good classic meatloaf accented with a layer of bacon on top.  Very simple and straightforward to make.  We couldn&#039;t get more than about two-thirds of the sauce aboard and would suggest making less, and the seasonings inside could be more adventurous, but many who like their meatloaf on the conservative side will like it that way.  Made for PAC spring 2013."
171790,503059,2013/8/7,5,Oh yeah! Very good and so easy. I served this with ice cream. Made for ZWT9 Caribbean Dessert  Challenge for the Soup-A-Stars
2000956541,531223,2017/5/22,0,"Didn't try yet. Mushrooms ?? piqued my interest and will try, but object to calling this sushi because recipe calls for &quot;smoked&quot; salmon, cooked shrimp ad artificial crab which I have rarely seen in good restaurants. Perhaps my definition of sushi ?? as raw seafood is incorrect. Also since seafood is not placed on patties of rice, wouldn't it technically be called sashimi?"
1900559,531223,2017/6/13,4,"Never saw salmon on the menu when in Japan, but. . . Sushi is rice rolled in nori seaweed with a filling of veggies, raw or cooked fish. Sashimi is usually raw fish or it can be cooked on a pressed portion of fresh sushi rice. I actually see noodles in the bowl and not rice. I guess it would work. Veggies can be burdock root, carrots, cucumber, avocado, or sometimes people use cream cheese. I recommend mixing the cream cheese with a little wasabi if you decide to use it. I serve my Japanese food with tamari sauce which has no or less wheat than soy sauce."
498271,508443,2013/11/12,5,"Wow this is a great martini!  I used candied ginger, otherwise made just as specified.  Great combination of flavors, smooth and easy to drink - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
400708,508443,2014/2/4,5,"This is so good, I love martini&#039;s of any kind and this one is just that much special.  Since I&#039;m out of the country didn&#039;t have my martini glasses so had to use a regular one &amp; stir when I usually prefer shaken.  But was able to get all the ingredients here in Peru to make it but no photo.  That bit of orange juice really made this drink.  No photo as not so pretty in my drinking glass but when I get home will be making it many more times and will get a pretty photo. &lt;br/&gt;Made for &quot;Best of 2013 Game"
136997,492967,2013/1/15,5,"I made this for myself, for dinner. I used white rice, as that is what I had in the fridge along with some leftover chicken. I added a touch more salsa (also mild) and soya sauce. Made for Everyday Holiday Tag game. :)"
895132,492967,2013/2/4,5,"This has become one of my favourite breakfasts! I make it with brown mochi rice which has a particularly nutty, slightly sweet flavour and goes so well with cheese and salsa.

865936,492967,2013/11/10,4,Simple to a fault.  I added sliced peppers and onions and roasted cauliflower and it made a great dinner!
364211,492967,2013/11/23,5,"Now that I have tried this recipe, I do understand the &quot;distraction&quot; that pammyowl referred to in describing this recipe.  I used white minute rice due to time constriction, and am out of brown rice.  I am actually eating this while reviewing, the more I eat, the more I am becoming addicted!  I will never forget this wonderful comforting recipe.  I had to search to find the Braggs Amino Acid, and am glad that I did because I don&#039;t think soy sauce would have made such an impression.  Now can&#039;t wait to make it with the brown rice!  Made to remember and celebrate Pammyowl!"
163112,506884,2013/9/30,5,"Fabulous!  I skipped the blanching &amp; just peeled the shallots.  I added extra tamarind, too.  Made for A Taste of Syria in the NA/ME Forum 9/13."
865936,503497,2013/7/14,5,The sauce really is to die for.  I served it to myself as written.  DH wanted it over pasta as a main dish with some clams added.  Great both ways.
169430,509068,2014/2/25,5,"I made this using dried coriander (what I had on hand), veg broth and chickpeas. It made a very tasty meal along with a greens and tomato salad. It&#039;s quite simple to make and is a hearty dish that you could vary in so many ways. :D"
227978,507169,2014/5/8,5,"This was so good, chef 1800069055.  It&#039;s smooth, tastes great and was enjoyed as a treat after a hectic day.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for the Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef event."
2000294240,499470,2015/6/25,5,"Very good!  I was nervous about making it, since no one had rated it, but I jumped in.  The crock pot was completely full.  It feeds a lot.  This is a basic recipe that you can add anything that you like!  I added jalapeno cheese, along with mozzarella.  Next time I am adding green chilies, instead of green onions, and cheddar cheese.  Don&#039;t be afraid to add anything you like... meat, cheese, veggies, whatever!"
2000431901,499470,2016/12/7,4,"Great recipe, really simple. Love that I can adapt this with whatever I want."

4439,512488,2014/1/23,5,"I got this recipe from Epicurious and we actually had it for dinner last night. It is easy to make and delicious to eat. Because of DH&#039;s bariatric surgery I did take off the skin from the chicken thighs, but that was the only change I made.  Annacia Thanks for posting the recipe and saving me the trouble. It is really a great meal."
2001117773,492778,2016/8/6,5,It was amazing i made it for my parents for their 70th b-day
280271,502619,2015/7/28,5,This was delicious...we really enjoyed the fresh taste...the avocado gives a nice smoothness to the overall texture...love the lime flavor...dang...all the ingredients work well together...not sure if this is a salad or a dip...but did serve it with the tortilla chips...so dip it is...made for FYC tag game...
266635,507876,2014/5/4,5,"This is a delicious eggplant parmesan.  It does take time, but it is well worth the results.  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of oil for frying (considerably). Served this dish with a side salad.  Made for Spring PAC, May, 2014."
542159,495284,2013/3/1,5,"So glad I fallowed your suggestion and served over brown rice because the makes an excellent rice bowl.  I made using the corn starch option and am glad I did or the sauce which we really liked would have been too thin. The only issue I had was the meat did not brown but that was neither the recipe or me it was the poor quality meat I bought (which had been injected with water Errrrr), but this recipe made even poor quality meat good. Thanks for the post and good luck in the contest."
1195537,495284,2013/3/1,5,"I love the ease CrockPot stews and this one was delicious! Browning the meat first deepened the flavor and make a terrific gravy. I followed the recipe, it was just great the way it was written; and enjoyed it with Parmesan Polenta! Made and reviewed for the ""Dining on a Dollar"" event, March 2013."
99254,495284,2013/3/1,5,"This was just FABULOUS! The meat was very tender and the flavors melded very well. This just may replace my current recipe for Pepper Steak. I used red, green and yellow peppers, so it made lovely presentation as well. Just outstanding!"
131126,495284,2013/3/2,5,"I thought this turned out well. It smelled wonderful cooking and the times were spot on.  I appreciated that the meat was tender without being crockpot mush and the veggies retained some crispness. The finished dish was colorful too which is always a plus. The sweet was an under note, but there was room for a tiny more tart."
128473,495284,2013/3/2,5,"Thank you for sharing this quick and easy to make recipe, it was wonderful served ontop of steamed jasmin rice.  It had good instructions and was a great use of contest ingredients. The flavors were excellent, bold, robust with a hint of heat.  The meat was tender, the vegetables were perfectly cooked.  We especially enjoyed the addition of the tomatoe in this dish. Good luck in the contest."

789516,493413,2013/1/13,5,I halved this recipe and it was fantastic.  Tons of flavour and not too hard to put together.  Love that you don't need to cook the chicken separate!
537179,493413,2013/3/20,5,"Super easy to make, with great flavor. Could of  used a little more heat but that&#039;s my personal tastes. Will be making again! Thanks for posting."
2746582,493413,2013/3/21,5,"5 STARS!!!!  This recipe was amazing!!!  Even the kids loved it and went back for more!  Def adding this one to the rotation!! Also, I omitted the green onions, my family is not much on onions....was still amazing!!"
1807391,493413,2013/3/21,5,This dish was awesome!  Will deffinately make again.  Next time I will reduce the hot sauce maybe by half.  My little kids found it to be too hot.  Thanks for a great recipe!
2493332,493413,2013/3/25,0,I made this for dinner the other night and my whole family loved it there was no leftovers.  Great recipe. Thanks for sharing
2802526,493413,2013/4/27,5,I used left over rotisery chicken also used some of the bacon grease to grease the glass casserole dish~  OMG sooooo Good!!  the family loved it  I added it w/scrambled eggs the next morning :)  AWESOME RECIPE :)
2808334,493413,2013/4/30,5,I put this recipe in the crock pot ! It was fabulous and the entire family loves it. Just put the potatoes in first for two hours on high then add the chicken for two hours and top when potatoes are tender and chicken is fully cooked! YUMMY!
2808380,493413,2013/5/1,5,"My husband and I love this recipe, my kids did not. So I make this for the both of us when they are away. The only thing I did different was half the hot sauce because it was a little spicy. Otherwise, I love this!"
934184,493413,2013/5/19,5,Delish! Make sure to stir potatoes at 10-15 min intervals as stated to ensure even cooking.
2876999,493413,2013/6/25,5,I increased the oil and reduced the hot sauce and this is everyone in my houses favorite. even my 3 year old!!!
2886949,493413,2013/7/2,0,"One of the best things about this recipe is that you can add your own variation to the recipe, in my case, I used melted margarine instead of oil ( didn&#039;t have any) and omitted the salt, omitted the onion as I didn&#039;t have any, but I used mozzarella cheese and old cheddar, it turned out wonderful :)"
2905581,493413,2013/7/17,5,"Made with BBQ marinated chicken instead of Buffalo sauce (serving kids, wanted to make sure everyone ate it)! LOVED IT!"
2925478,493413,2013/7/31,5,I made this for dinner and it was a total hit!! I went on the lighter side with hot sauce not knowing how it would taste. Next time I am going full strength!! I rate this 6 stars whoo hoo no more boring 1 dish meals :D
11717288,493413,2013/10/1,0,"This was pretty good! I will change a few things next time! Ill cook the chicken first, because I am a freak about this...and I could not tell when it was done!!! I let the chicken cook for about 10 min before adding the cheese, and it was still too much for the cheese...I wouldnt add the cheese until the last 5 minutes! We topped this with sour cream and maters!!!!"
41218,493413,2013/10/28,0,"I&#039;m rating as I changed the recipe in order to meet my family&#039;s tastes by using less spice and hot sauce.  Since it&#039;s rated 5 stars, there are people out there who like to sweat and tear up (kidding).  We enjoyed ours.  My only concern for what looked like a one dish meal is it is labor intensive -  frying the bacon, chopping the potatoes into small pieces &amp; chicken as well, and stirring the potatoes every 15 minutes with a super hot oven.  I think the recipe could be rewritten using less time and still have the same good flavor - I&#039;m not sure what that would be."
1800241449,493413,2013/11/13,5,"Like prior reviewers said, it is a bit time intensive for prep, but this is SOOOOOooooo good! I made it exactly as described, but I used a fajita cut of chicken I purchased at Sprouts and only cut those strips into cubes. Some ways to cut down on prep time: use a rotisserie chicken, use canned diced potatoes, use real bacon bits (I&#039;ve seen them at Costco).  Personally, I would still use real potatoes and bacon, but I may substitute rotisserie chicken. I&#039;ll be trying it with scrambled eggs in the morning as a prior reviewer suggested, too!"
1801642324,493413,2013/12/31,0,"I think this would be better with less hot sauce.  I read reviews to half it, which I did, but it was still too hot... Even for my husband. Had to make kids something else because of the heat.  I used two tbsp of hot sauce.  I&#039;m thinking Louisiana hot sauce must be different from regular somehow? Because we were both sniffling all supper.  Good flavour aside from the heat, though."
1802379542,493413,2014/1/19,5,"I made this last night and it&#039;s DELICIOUS! Because my honey has a sensitive tummy, I cut back on the hot sauce by about 2 Tbsp. Other than that I made no changes. Makes lots &amp; lots, but we&#039;re having leftovers for the championship football games today. Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe!"
1802399163,493413,2014/1/23,5,"This recipe was very, very good. I used Frank&#039;s brand wing sauce, and I actually thought it wasn&#039;t spicy enough, but the flavor was great. I might add some regular hot sauce to up the heat next time. Served with ranch dressing and it was wonderful. I&#039;m the only woman in a house full of men and the guys in my house ate this up."
1802438803,493413,2014/2/1,0,I found that it only took 20 minutes to cook the potatoes and 45 to cook the chicken all the way through.
725939,493413,2014/2/2,5,"Prep time was lengthy...BUT I broil my bacon in the oven on HI then crumble. I did use 2 TBSP of the bacon grease in the potato mixture and I added more oilive oil. I cut the hot sauce back to only 4TBSP. I would rather use fresh garlic than powdered next time. The rest I followed the recipe, and it was a HUGE HIT. They guys have already asked for it again. I diced the chicken in small chunks and placed on 400 for 25mins and it was so tender and juicy. &lt;br/&gt;We will be having this again!&lt;br/&gt;To turn up the heat you could add jalapeno&#039;s."
2000171342,493413,2015/4/28,1,"Crap directions says wait until potatoes fully cooked 2 times then raw chicken only cooks for 15 mins... Pink, waste of food!"
1802451051,493413,2014/2/3,4,"This is a really great dish! The only thing is that it calls for a tbsp of pepper, 2 tbsp garlic powder and a tbsp of paparika. To me all if the seasonings are too strong and drowned out the flavor of the hot sauce. (I use franks because I love it and it&#039;s not too hot for my liking) however the pepper is so strong and brings a lot of heat! Otherwise, fabulous dish! And I also cooked it longer with the chicken because it made me nervous putting it on raw. I overcooked the cheese and bacon :-( still tasty! Now, I know better! I might saut"
866963,493413,2014/2/14,5,This was amazing! For once I did not feel the need to make any modifications to a recipe. It was perfect just the way it was. It has just the right amount of kick without being too hot. My son and I even enjoyed the leftovers for lunch. This will be made again and again. (23)
1802486073,493413,2014/2/22,0,Im making this for dinner tonight - I am very excited it looks delicious!
1697311,493413,2014/2/23,5,"This was an amazing dish, everyone loved it! The only thing is, my kids found it a tad bit spicy, so I&#039;ll be putting only half the hot sauce next time, and once I added the chicken and baked it for 15 minutes, the chicken was still raw, so I had to put it in for another 15 minutes. Not sure if it is the oven though. But, I will be making this again!! Yummy!!!"
1802699146,493413,2014/4/26,5,We loved this.  My kids however did detect a hint of spicy.  But they ate it anyway!  Offered Ranch to offset the &quot;spicy&quot;.  Husband enjoyed it.  I did however use a shortcut.  I used Boar&#039;s Head pre cooked Bacon and just chopped it up and added it to the top of the cheese at the end of the cooking time.  ( Not having to cook the bacon saves time and is less caloric).  I also used raw chicken strips (from the fresh meat section)  which makes cutting up the chicken faster as well.
10648071,493413,2014/5/6,1,"Sorry everyone- this was NOT good! Fatty, greasy. I cut 1/2 the cheese and bacon and it was still too much. Have found a few great recipes on this site, unfortunately this was not one of them"
2009584,493413,2014/6/15,5,Loved it!  Just know thy oven at 500!  (I stirred every 12 min so it  cut down on the potato cook time a bit)
1802874507,493413,2014/7/1,5,My family and I loved it! I didn&#039;t add the diced onions because we don&#039;t really have a taste for those! I did one side buffalo and the other regular and it was soooo good!
1802950186,493413,2014/7/20,5,I absolutely love this recipe!!! The only thing I did different was cook the bacon with white onion and put it over the cheese and let the bacon crisp up in the oven. Other than that the dish was awesome!!!!
1802965316,493413,2014/7/26,5,"This was SO yummy!!! Once I added the chicken, I cooked for 30 minutes instead of 15. Then I added the cheese and bacon and let cook for 10 more minutes. I also halfed the hot sauce and added buffalo sauce. Absolutely delicious!"
1802998197,493413,2014/8/5,5,"Made this last night for dinner because I had several left over baked potatoes from the night before.   I cut each potato into eight wedges with skin still on and lined the bottom of the dish with them. For the chicken, I used deep fried chicken nuggets tossed in &quot;Hooters&quot; wing sauce that you can buy in the grocery store; that sauce is amazing.  I added the remaining ingredients and it was ready in no time because everything in the pan was cooked. I just needed to warm it all through.  My daughter likes it with sour cream on the side.  I like it with chunky blue cheese or ranch dressing.  A favorite in my house."
1802495938,493413,2014/8/13,5,"This turned out good! I only made a couple slight substitutions for some things I didn&#039;t have on hand. (Used garlic salt instead of powder, vegetable instead of olive oil, and mixed hot and buffalo sauce). Regardless, this was delicious and definitely something I will make again. Has a nice kick and ranch dressing complements this perfectly. It reminds me of something indulgent you would get a restaurant as an appetizer, but I have no problem eating this as a meal."
1803104729,493413,2014/9/4,5,"I only put about half the hot sauce and added some BBQ sauce(little mouths too feed ;). I also added 1/2 cup corn, 3 rolls of frozen chopped spinach, 1/4 each red,yellow and orange peppers :) delicious!"
12759586,493413,2014/10/10,5,Loved it !!  used Louisiana hot sauce Great recipe.My friends loved it to
1391069,493413,2014/10/22,3,good flavor but way to greasy.
1803275142,493413,2014/10/28,5,This was a fantastic dish! My family loved it. I would recommend to cook the chicken for 30 minutes and add toppings the last 10 minutes of baking time. I would definitely make this dish again.
360437,493413,2014/11/8,5,So good. Made exactly as written and it&#039;s absolutely delicious!
2067140,493413,2014/11/9,5,This was a hit!  All I did was cut down the hot sauce by half as my family do not like things too spicy.  I definitely will make this again.
1803336850,493413,2014/11/13,5,"We made this without the hot sauce (we aren&#039;t into super-spicy foods), and it was amazing! It was still a bit hot for our tastes, but I won&#039;t downgrade a recipe that is supposed to be hot for being hot. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will definitely make this again. Next time, we will try it with half the black pepper."
1803407574,493413,2014/11/25,5,I served this with Ranch dressing and couldn&#039;t get enough of it.  Best recipe I have tried in years.
1803483582,493413,2014/12/10,5,We have made this several times now. Always a party in the mouth. Wow. Awesome casserole.
1803522956,493413,2014/12/19,0,A big hit in my house! Only recommendation is to cook the chicken slightly in a skillet before adding to potatoes. Each time I make it the chicken is still fairly rawbafter the 15 minutes. I always have to cook it another 15-20 minutes! The potatoes then get a bit overcooked. So either out in earlier or are cook chicken a little bit. So yummy though!!
126440,493413,2015/3/8,4,Potatoes were over cooked almost burned at 40 min.  added chicken and toppings and baked for 12 min. Flavor was good but would do it differently next time.
2000129513,493413,2015/4/9,5,I add a pack of ranch dip mix and use buffalo sauce instead of hot sauce. This is a huge hit at our house!
1064524,493413,2015/5/22,3,I just made this for dinner.  I think the consensus is that it is a good food for teenagers.   I don&#039;t think I will make it again.
1802849661,493413,2015/7/15,5,"Yummy!! I love how crispy the potatoes went and with the seasoning, chicken and topping this was a winner in my house!"
2000353718,493413,2015/7/21,5,So so yummy and had my picky eater BF dying for leftovers the next day. I increased the oil and served with Franks buffalo sauce and ranch dressing over top.
2000369324,493413,2015/7/28,5,I made a minor (but surprising) change. It became accidentally awesome. Instead of standard potatoes I used sweet potatoes. Holy cow this was such a solid change in the right direction.
2000426197,493413,2015/8/24,5,Great meal for a Sunday. Just one thing I noticed was it didn&#039;t state to add buffalo sauce. Luckily I had some to add before sliding the dish into the oven.
1802320406,493413,2015/9/3,5,"Tangy buffalo sauce, salty bacon, buttery potatoes and cheese - what could be bad? This is hands down one of my favorite recipes of all time."
97893,493413,2015/10/27,5,Good ... and hot ... but I felt this was more football food than dinner. I&#039;ll definitely be making this again but will reserve it for the next football get together.
2000588457,493413,2016/2/26,3,"The directions regarding the potatoes were somewhat mixed up. As far as the raw chicken is concerned, unless you want to risk any form of food poisoning, I suggest cooking the chicken first. Overall a very tasty recipe."
2000297034,493413,2016/2/27,5,"I didn&#039;t change the ingredients, but I did change up the cooking directions by pre-cooking the chicken. I just couldn&#039;t place it in the oven on top of the potatoes. (That&#039;s just my preference)

Anyway, It&#039;s a great recipe; tasty and spicy."
2000895286,493413,2016/2/28,5,"Only complaint is 45 minutes for potatos is too long...and I was stirring.    I put the chicken in at 25 minutes after the potato&#039;s, cooked @ 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then put the toppings on for 10 minutes.    A bit greasy at the bottom, BUT, really good.   We put sour cream on."
141277,493413,2016/3/9,5,"This turned out fantastic.  I did saute the chicken on the stove top while the potatoes were baking.  Then mixed it all together and baked it until the cheese was bubbly.  I think the next time I make it, I will add a couple of diced up tomatoes.  Husband asked for it again--success.  Tastes great right now as I eat my lunch at work the next day."
2000952193,493413,2016/4/1,4,"great  recipe tasty with a little bite 
wasnt as hard as some thought to figure out how to do the potatoes"
2000725800,493413,2016/4/29,4,"This was pretty good. If I make this again I&#039;ll use the idea another poster had to half the hot sauce and add BBQ sauce for the other half.  It was way too hot for 4 of the 5 of us. I did add a sweet potato because I didn&#039;t have enough potatoes. That did help to head off the heat. Also served it with sour cream. That helped, too."
2001006157,493413,2016/5/9,4,Tasty....but I would cut the salt in half. I used Franks Buffalo.
2000865641,493413,2016/5/26,5,"Wow! This casserole is amazing. My two teenagers absolutely loved it. The sauce is incredible and I'm using it in other recipes. If you have a history of heart disease in your family, you may want to pass on this one. Cooked chicken 30 minutes and added toppings last 10 minutes."
2001102949,493413,2016/7/26,5,I used already cooked rotisserry chicken as i onew the raw chicken would take way longer than 15 minutes and i used a whole bottle of hot sauce otherwise it is fairly dry and my fanily loves spicy :) came out great served eith some bleu cheese crumbles on top as well
1803322077,493413,2016/9/29,5,My somewhat picky teenage son went back for seconds that makes it 5 stars for me. I was scared of the heat but I made it exactly as written and we all liked it. I cooked potatoes at 500 for 20 minutes; lowered oven to 400 &amp; added chicken for 20 to 25 minutes; added toppings for last 10 minutes. Thank you for posting.
2001249276,493413,2016/11/16,0,The taste was good but it was very dry. How can I get it to be more moist and more sauce without making it too hot?
2001331004,493413,2016/12/31,0,"We love this. Always good for game day! I cook it just like it says only I add a packet of ranch dressing mix and a little extra olive oil, and serve with ranch dressing or sour cream. It takes the heat down just a little. Always a hit in our house!"
2001414893,493413,2017/3/3,5,"This is unbelievably good. It's not often I find a recipe the whole family loves. This recipe is it. The only changes I made was the oven temp. Instead of 500, I did 450, cooking for 45 min before adding chicken. I also cook the chicken for 30 minutes. (I did these changes due to people complaining about over cooked potatoes and undercooked chicken. These changes make it come out perfect.) Oh, and I used way less pepper. 1 tablespoon is a bit much for me. I use freshly ground and that would be a lot of grinding! Plus, I like pepper, but not that much! ;) I used Frank's hot sauce and it must be more mild then what some reviewers are using. The heat wasn't too much and I was asked by one of my kids to put in more. Everything else remained the same. I served it with blue cheese dressing for the adults, ranch for the kids. One of the best things about this is the leftovers. Everyone fights for the leftovers! (A miracle!) The last time I made it, one of my kids was angry that she didn't get more leftovers! I had to assure her that the next time I make it, I will double the recipe. The leftovers are that good. I could make this every week and my kids would be fine with it. It's that good! :) Now I'm always asked to make it. Always! I tell my kid, I have to get potatoes to make it again. Her response, get potatoes!"
1803420150,493413,2017/5/10,5,I have made this several times for family and friends and it's always a hit. We are a bit wimpy with spicy heat so I do reduce the hot sauce and put it on the table for those who want to fire it up. Left overs are great for breakfast with a fried egg on top too!!
2001533872,493413,2017/5/12,5,A household favorite for my family. They practically beg me to cook this
2001563793,493413,2017/6/1,5,"We make this at least once a month with one change. We double the sauce into two bowls, one for the potatoes and one for the chicken."
2001616509,493413,2017/9/1,0,This casserole is so good!
2001748837,493413,2017/10/11,5,"I took the suggestion of putting the coated potatoes in the crockpot for 2 hours and then then adding canned chicken breasts for another hour. I added the topping of cheese, bacon, and onions a few minutes before serving. The people at my home group potluck loved it! It's easy and tastes wonderful! I'm saving this for the future!"
2001664969,493413,2017/11/17,5,"I found this recipe here a few years ago and everyone loves it. I had to give the recipe to my brother, my sister-in-law and my mother-in-law. I omit the onions bc my husband is picky and I don't like cooked onions. I heap the oil and the hot sauce and then scoop out a couple spoonfuls to reserve for the chicken. I use a whole pack of bacon and a bag of the shredded cheese from the store. I am not sure if it is just my oven or not but after I put the chicken, cheese and bacon on top of the potatoes I have to continue to cook it for about 25 minutes but that could be my oven is a little older. This recipe takes awhile to cook bc of all of the bacon but me and my husband really like it and so does everyone I make it for."
2001841310,493413,2017/12/6,0,I. end up making 2 things of the seasoning/sauce &amp; use the tomatoes sauce-ElPato. It is a huge hit.
2951596,493413,2018/1/8,0,"Made it for a poker party using the ingredients but totally different process. I baked the potatoes and sauteed blackened chicken thighs cut everything into bitesize pieces, mixed with hot sauce with hot smoked paprika and ghee. Layered in Ninja cooking system with bacon, scallions and cheese. Everyone loved it!"
222564,493413,2018/1/23,4,"Tasty dish! I parboiled the potatoes first, to reduce the baking time by about half."
2002063909,493413,2018/3/20,5,My favorite winter comfort dish! Cold day and with a 500 degree oven makes this the perfect winter casserole. Yummm!!!!
2001932308,493413,2018/3/28,5,I make this as directed and it’s perfect every time. This is what’s for dinner tonight. Yummy served with crescent rolls and maybe a small spinach salad. This dish is awesome with scrambled eggs in a breakfast quesadilla.
2002172409,493413,2018/6/2,0,Good recipe with some alterations. Have made this several times and the chicken always needs more time to cook. What I do now is during the last 15 minutes when the potatoes are roasting I put the chicken on a cookie sheet and pre cook the chicken. This gives the chicken a beautiful golden brown color and ensures that it will be fully cooked when it comes out of the oven.
2002204214,493413,2018/7/1,1,This recipe is confusing to me. The potato part doesn't make sense.
2002190476,493413,2018/10/4,0,I agree with Mrs. Brenda. The directions are very confusing. The chicken part doesn't make sense
2233392,494995,2013/2/10,5,This recipe sounds really good and something we would like.  I plan on making it soon.
305531,504144,2014/5/10,4,"Quick and simple pizza recipe. Mine did not get as crisp as I had hoped, but the taste was good. Next time, I&#039;ll add some meats and/or veggies. Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014."
1925885,503791,2013/7/17,5,"Wow!  I made this recipe for a ZWT9 challenge to adapt a recipe to vegan, and chose this one because it seemed fairly simple to adapt.  I made it vegan by using vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth, and replaced the sour cream with a greek garlic and potato sauce called skordalia which was leftover from Recipe#503872 (awesome, BTW!). I only used 1/2 tsp cumin, and only 1 tsp of the oil to saute. The result was amazing. The soup is rich and creamy in spite of having virtually no fat other than a tiny bit of oil used to saut&eacute; the leek and garlic. When paired with the skordalia, it was a sensual delight.  The soup is sweet and creamy, and the skordalia is tangy and garlicky.  I kept taking bites with and without skordalia, not able to decide which was better.  I came away knowing that this was the best of all worlds - I really CAN have my cake and eat it too!  I will make this recipe again, both in it&#039;s original form and in it&#039;s new vegan adaptation.  Thanks for posting!"
329769,503791,2013/9/1,5,Reviewed for ZWT9 Family Picks- an easy and delicious pumpkin soup. I used butternut pumpkin for this recipe- I think this is known as butternut squash in US.
2898808,507748,2013/10/22,5,"Being from New England, this time of year I was looking for a pumpkin cheesecake recipe.&lt;br/&gt;Made for a dinner party and it was absolutley delicious. Am still making copies of the recipe for my friends who tried it. I made my own graham cracker crust, not store bought. Recipe did not say to cook crust before, so I followed a recipe that said to chill for an hour. Worked well. Topped off with whipped cream.&lt;br/&gt;Will make this again and again this fall. &lt;br/&gt;Mary&lt;br/&gt;Litfhfield, NH"
266635,507748,2013/11/5,5,"Sooo delicious and sooo easy to make -- a great holiday dessert for sure.  But, since canned pumpkin is available all year round, don&#039;t wait for the holidays.  This cheesecake turned out perfectly and the whipped cream is a big bonus -- made mine from scratch.  Will definitely make this dessert again for Thanksgiving as I know it will be a hit.  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
2000045537,507748,2015/3/7,5,"This was fantastic and So easy to do! I will definitely make this again.
Thank you!!"
2003851,496703,2013/8/24,1,"This sounds really good, but I used my Weight Watchers Points Plus calculator to calculate the points plus value from the nutritional info provided and the total points if this is one serving is 7 not 2."
567892,496703,2014/1/15,5,Meant to give it a 5 star
1057114,512019,2015/6/30,5,This was delicious.  I used fruit I had on hand; 1/2 cup pureed strawberries for the yogurt and three bananas in place of applesauce.  I&#039;ll be making this often.  I love that it doesn&#039;t have white flour and it almost tasted like a mousse.  Problem is I can&#039;t stop eating it.  Thanks for sharing.
2001462362,514664,2017/3/29,0,I used this recipe for my Spanish banquet and it worked out wonderful! I love the tenderness of the chicken and the optional lime gave it some acidity.
2001935456,529787,2018/1/16,4,it is a good recipe
911978,511465,2015/11/17,5,"It was soooooo gooood! I had to make some changes, using different type of dried mushroom, dried sage instead of fresh, and red wine instead of white. White wine would be way better for the color of the dish but I had to do with what I had. And I had no cheese. Still the flavor was great. Thanks for a rather simple, yet delicious recipe, which helped me to utilize roasted duck leftovers in a wonderful way."
1540216,520337,2017/3/31,0,Where's the beef? or in this case turkey. lol
724631,507154,2013/10/23,4,"Tasty turkey, even though I wasn&#039;t expecting the 14.23-lb. turkey to be ready in under 2 hours.  I couldn&#039;t find any time reference points for roasting turkey at this temperature, so the turkey&#039;s internal temperature was past 200F when I checked on it.  The turkey drumstick bones literally fell out during carving.  Apparently this is the downside of cooking at high temperature: if you don&#039;t catch the target temperature just when reached, the dish can overcook substantially by the time you check.  Miraculously, the meat was still moist -- both dark and white meat.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2414876,524960,2015/12/1,5,Such a fun idea for the dipping :)
1592049,524960,2015/12/2,5,So Delicious and Flavorful :)
2672297,524960,2015/12/2,5,"I love this recipe, clever and creative and super delicious!"
914360,524960,2015/12/2,5,Five stars
2517637,524960,2015/12/2,5,Definite party recipe for the holidays!
2200921,524960,2015/12/2,5,What a great idea for Ragu
2708802,524960,2015/12/3,5,Loved this recipe - just about licked the pot!
2189849,524960,2015/12/3,5,Let&#039;s eat ~ invite me over ~ I love this dish!
2657133,524960,2015/12/3,5,Sounds De-Lish!

2708825,524960,2015/12/10,5,What a great recipe and idea - loved it!
117501,529600,2018/12/17,5,This is our go-to recipe for soft chocolate chip cookies. They turn out perfect every time. Thanks for posting.
2000190754,521597,2015/5/7,5,"This salad was delicious! I used a bag of powergreens instead of Arugula and a 8*oz container of the pico, also I used soy nuts that were seasoned and toasted so I cut back on salt! Very good and fresh tasting!"
2000751165,519533,2015/12/17,5,Tried this recipe and loved it!! Best recipe by far! And the nutmeg gave them that extra flavor that brought it up a notch! Yummmmmm!!
2002251978,537076,2018/12/3,0,"I thought this came out pretty good, nice fresh tastes"
2002189539,537076,2018/12/4,4,"Was tasty, hubby and daughter loved it, will probably use 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes and slightly less olives or chop them up finer - Thnk u for sharing"
1052873,505637,2013/8/30,4,"The meat was nice and tender, but the spices didn&#039;t transfer to the meat so it was really bland. Maybe next time soak in milk for few hours then put in a baggie with the spice paste, then cook. Made for ZWT9."
131126,509193,2014/4/24,3,"I was timid after seeing the amount of spices listed in this recipe.  The amounts seemed excessive for 1 1/2 cup of dip.  I added 1 pkt of Lipton&#039;s onion soup mix. 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder.  It had plenty of flavor for us.  Served with french dips for Spring 2014 Pick A Chef."
2000431901,503915,2017/5/1,3,"Pretty good, SUPER messy! Not as spicy as we were expecting. I'd definitely kick the spice up next time."
135470,503915,2013/7/20,5,"I wasn&#039;t sure about this but gave it a go and we really enjoyed it. I reduced the amount of seasoning because we&#039;re not big Cajun spice fans and added some garlic and cilantro to the mayo.  I only had small shrimp and I think larger ones would have even better flavor (and would be less likely to fall out of the bun). We were out of tomato and used a red pepper instead of yellow but all that did was change the color. I served them on toasted potato buns which complimented the shrimp really well. This was a delightful lunch, thanks for sharing! Made for ZWT 9 - US - Cajun/Creole by one of the Appliance Killers."
128473,503915,2013/7/26,5,"Wow, was this recipe awesome Cadillacgirl.  My dh &amp; I loved it.  Sooo good, great textures and the flavor, yummy.  It was delicious, I doubled the spices and used extra large shrimp, it worked beautifully.  Served the shrimp on a toasted hamburger bun, which I added remoulade sauce too, then the lettuce and tomato, shrimp and then the hot and spicy mayonnaise sauce.  This was perfection, a lovely zing of flavor, thanks so much for sharing.  Made for ZWT9."
169430,503915,2013/9/3,5,"Oh My Goodness. Why did I not try this sooner? It&#039;s marvelous, also quick and simple to make. It all adds up to a 5 star hit for me. :D"
452355,503915,2013/10/3,4,"DH and I made this shrimp burger for dinner last night.  It is a good weeknight meal because it is fast and easy to prepare.  The only modification that we made was to use regular Tabasco sauce in place of the jalapeno Tabasco because that was what we had on hand.  We expected this to be a little spicier, and we ended up adding extra Tabasco to taste over our individual servings.  Served with Recipe #501143."
266635,536212,2018/11/9,5,This was a great way to make this loaded potato dish. The only change I made was to omit the onions and just use the green onions only. I covered the potatoes with parchment paper vs. foil and they turned out perfectly. Definitely a repeat at our house.
169430,512739,2014/2/7,4,"This is a tasty dish that comes together easily. I chose and made it as directed it because I knew that my DH would love it. He did love it, went back for seconds and gave it 5 stars. The recipe has 4 stars because because, for me, it was under seasoned. Nancy said to feel free to spice it up but if I had then DH wouldn&#039;t even have tried it. I made the full recipe for the 2 of us and I&#039;ll add Cajun seasoning to my next serving (and DH will still be happy!). I used a small roaster out of the freezer and would recommend less time in the first bake if you are using a fryer. If you have a spiceaphobe in the family like I do just put a shaker of something with some heat in it on the table for those who wish to have it and everyone will be happy quite happy. :D"
37449,510209,2014/1/19,5,So wishing I could upload a photo for this! So easy to make and I had fun painting and smearing paint on a white plate.  Thanks for posting!
1803472963,516910,2014/12/9,5,So easy to make and my family is loving them!
315565,505632,2013/8/15,5,I made this tonight [halving the recipe] and while it did not rise a great deal it tasted fabulous and also looked pretty good. In my opinion you cannot go wrong with the combo of chocolate and dates !! Made for ZWT9.
1802565096,506511,2014/3/9,1,"What a disaster.  When I opened the foil from the casserole dish, I discovered my chicken swimming in brown liquid among hard kernels of rice.  After cutting and chopping the garlic and  ginger, and adding the always great ingredient (who hasn&#039;t had a wonderful recipe once you&#039;ve included balsamic vinegar?), I expected....well, not a brown soup of uncooked rice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank goodness for Trader Joe&#039;s frozen microwavable rice and for soy sauce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surely you didn&#039;t mean minute rice?  Ewwww.  But at least after baking at 400 for 45 minutes it might have been cooked???"
2000635500,523938,2015/11/3,5,"Delicious - best crab cake I&#039;ve ever had! Easy to make, lots of crab meat and just the right amount of flavour and creaminess.  Makes for an easy, healthy meal paired with a salad!"
1369655,493817,2014/6/14,4,I have made this and it&#039;s very tasty. No comparison to the stuff ready made at the store.
2001405256,493817,2017/2/25,5,The flavor was spot on. The method worked wonderfully. The consistency was looser than I prefer (it was pourable) so next time I'll cut back on the milk by a half cup ave heavy cream by a quarter cup.
2001174612,493817,2018/4/2,3,"I'm a pretty good cook, but I was disappointed in this recipe. It never thickened. I had to freeze it to serve it and that was not very successful as it melted quickly. The texture was grainy. Probably something I did wrong. I grew up on homemade butterscotch puddings. This was no match to my memory."
865936,502695,2013/9/16,5,"I decided to make these into wings because I had them on hand.  These were truly really, really scrumptious!  The recipe made a lot of marinade. I grilled half and froze the other half.  Yay me!  Because of the sugar, the marinade did try to burn, so I just browned the outsides and stuck them in the microwave for 2 minutes.  That is not cheating."
1567897,494425,2013/5/6,5,"Instead of chipotle powder, I saut&eacute; the shrimp in adobo sauce and a couple of minced chipotle chilies from the can.  I also sprinkle with crispy bacon bits.  Add a splash of fresh lime juice at the end.  Fabulous!"
198154,521084,2017/12/8,4,"I made a few slight alterations to use up what we hand on hand. I used two ham bones that my mother in law sent home from Thanksgiving to make the broth. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of regular canned tomatoes cut up and dried parsley instead of fresh. I didn't have any, but my family really enjoyed it. Served with a loaf of fresh bread. A very comforting meal on a cold day."
1072593,493659,2013/9/25,5,"Ahhhhhh, the Naw Awlans way and said like a true dat.  So goooood!"
169430,505623,2013/8/18,5,A new and welcome dimension to mayo. It takes just moments to stir up and will a tremendous flavor boost to anything you used it with. I was making a carrot salad while this was on the counter and it took no time at all to make one of the carrots vanish by dipping it into this condiment. Way to go Bethie! :D
47892,505623,2013/8/22,5,"Yummy five times over! Used homemade mayo and used this as a dip for veggies and homemade French fries, too! Made for ZWT9. Many more uses I&#039;m sure of that!"
383346,505623,2013/8/22,5,I made a small batch and ate it with a steak.  It was yummy and spicy.  Thanks Elmotoo :)  Made for ZWT9
2002320536,493858,2018/11/3,5,Great soup. I used 2 percent milk instead on the condensed - but it was still delicious!
895132,497280,2013/3/14,5,"Couldn't resist to try it the moment it was posted ;-) My honey is creamy honey from a friend who's a beekeeper, and the cocoa was raw cocoa powder. Utterly yummy - DH and I enjoyed this very much. Thanks for sharing!<br/>Made for Healthy Choices Tag Game / Superfood Special March 2013"
804870,500502,2013/9/22,4,"Stuck in a bachelor cabin with all the ingredients for pancakes EXCEPT baking powder.  ...was very happy to find this recipe.  The pancakes turned out pretty tasty - they&#039;re a little heavier/denser than regular pancakes, but still good.  Only recommendation would be to pay attention to the amount (2C milk + 2C flour + 2 eggs makes a lot of pancake batter for just 2 people).  Thanks for posting!"
1802610577,500502,2014/3/23,0,"I never have baking powder so was happy to find recipe with baking soda instead. I added a tablespoon of vanilla and a smashed banana too.  Like previous review, this is a lot for two people &quot;)"
1802887380,500502,2014/7/4,3,It was OK. 2 eggs was a little much. Tasted more like an omelet.
10538150,500502,2014/9/6,4,"I think these pancakes were alright. Without the vanilla I added I don&#039;t think they would be too great. I cut the recipe in half and added about 1/4 tsp vanilla this was able to make 5-5&quot; pancakes, enough for two. After my changes totally 5 stars :) They aren&#039;t TOO rich so if you&#039;re expecting that then look for another recipe. Personally, I prefer a pancake that isn&#039;t too rich so this was perfect! Have fun with your pancakes!"
1803260780,500502,2014/10/24,2,This recipe needs improvement in terms of taste. Quite frankly these pancakes turned out nasty. Tasted ok with more salt and lots of real maple syrup.
1803464466,500502,2014/12/6,3,"I promised my kids pancakes this Saturday morning only to discover I had no trace of baking powder in my home.  After a quick internet search, I decided to give this recipe a whirl.  It did the job, however I had to make a few adjustments.  1.) 2 cups of milk is just too much for the amount of dry ingredients in this recipe, I would recommend cutting down to 1.5 cups. 2.) I added a bit more sugar to get the taste of the batter &quot;right,&quot; just a half teaspoon more.  Other than that, this is a solid classic pancake recipe for when you&#039;re in a pinch (or without a pinch of baking powder)."
2000116149,500502,2015/4/4,5,Didn&#039;t have baking powder so this worked great. Reduced amounts in half and used spelt flour and maple syrup rather than sugar.
2000168609,500502,2015/4/26,5,amazing i usually use a kellogg pancake mix thing and i just ran out. So i wanted to make pancakes but had no baking powder. And it turns out i like it better then the kelloggs thing
2000206608,500502,2015/5/16,1,These were terrible
2000274945,500502,2015/6/16,5,"Pancake Tuesday and had no baking powder, so I found this recipe. I added some fresh blueberries and lemon zest, other than that followed the recipe exact, My three kids aged 15 yrs to 3 yrs, just loved them. Said they where the best pancakes I have ever made. I didn&#039;t have pancakes tonight but did try a bite and they where good (I have never been a pancake fan) 5 stars cause the kids ate them all up."
2000395504,500502,2015/8/10,3,This was pretty good but I also did 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of two with an extra tbsp of sugar and threw in some chocolate chips
2000824002,500502,2016/1/17,5,I also used less milk and a little more sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  They turned out great!
2001071736,500502,2016/7/2,4,"spur of moment idea, my hosts had no b powder so i treid this. i added blueberies and we did not have vanilla so.... they were great! not as fluffy but really good."
2001133892,500502,2016/8/19,5,"Great recipe! Makes a lot of pancakes, so make sure you've got some way to store the remaining batter until you use it up! This recipe results in dense but fluffy at the same time pancakes. Delicious!!"
2001288919,500502,2016/12/9,1,"Regretting not reading the reviews before hand, I followed the recipe exactly and ended up throwing them out , had a bad taste and wasn't sweet enough."
2001298983,500502,2016/12/15,5,"Oh my goodness! I love baking and cooking, but have never made a single batch of perfect pancakes until now! I'll have burned pancakes and some raw in the middle. I cannot believe how delicious these turned out!"
2001355971,500502,2017/1/17,5,"Great recipe and the pancakes turned out to be very fluffy, but I recommend using 1 1/2 cups of milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Also try adding chocolate chips to sweeten them up!"
2001369691,500502,2017/1/28,5,My sisters and I scrambled down seven of those super delectably scrumptious pancakes in no time! Thank you www.food.com for this awesome recipe!
2001370787,500502,2017/1/29,5,"I was looking for a pancake recipe that used baking soda just like everyone else...lol this worked out great! I used 2 cups vanilla almond milk because I didn't have vanilla extract &amp; I substituted water for the missing vanilla extract. Also, I sprinkled cinnamon on the pancakes as I made each one &amp; it was a hit! Everything else, I measured, was just as it was in your recipe! Thank you!"
2001384727,500502,2017/2/9,4,I made a half batch. I used 1.25 cup of almond milk and 2/3tsp sugar... everything else was exactly the same. I added cinnamon and the juice from half an orange. The acid in the orange helps the baking soda act like baking powder so they came out fluffy and delicious.
2001387085,500502,2017/2/11,4,"They turned out amazing!!!! I woke up and wanted to make pancakes, but there was no baking powder. My mother said I couldn't do it, but I proved her wrong. P.S. go's great with a berry syrup that I made!"
2001486520,500502,2017/4/13,4,"Awesome recipe, easy to follow and complete."
2001525939,500502,2017/5/7,1,This recipe is terrible very bitter dont waste your time
2001527070,500502,2017/5/8,4,Really good recipe
2001549162,500502,2017/5/22,5,"I was out of baking powder so I decided to try this recipe, and I really liked it. I used all purpose flour instead of wheat flour, and I did not take the time to sift. The pancakes were not as light and fluffy as pancakes with baking powder. They were a bit heavier but tasted very good. In fact, they tasted so good that I am making them again today."
2001596235,500502,2017/6/23,0,These are the most deplorable pancakes I've ever tasted. They were gummy and not sweet in the least. Ew.
2001607886,500502,2017/7/1,5,It was delish my family loved them..and in my opinion these are better than the box mix in the store
2001645487,500502,2017/8/1,1,"It had a strong taste of eggs, and didn't have much flavor. I prefer box mix over this recipe."
2001674030,500502,2017/8/15,5,everyone's always complaining about something lol. these pancakes are just fine and way cheaper than buying a box
2001697811,500502,2017/9/2,0,These were so gross.... gummy. not sweet. do not use this recipe.
2001732707,500502,2017/9/28,5,Absolutely excellent. Made these with no problem and they taste awesome.
2001872588,500502,2017/12/27,4,"I followed the advice to use 1.5 c milk, I chose soy milk, and 2 tbs sugar. I went with 1 tbs olive oil instead of the butter. The taste is a bit eggy, almost like French toast. My family liked it because it wasn't as sweet as some other recipes."
2001911322,500502,2018/1/4,1,"I would not make this again, they turned out flat and dense and gummy, like someone else mentioned above. Do yourself a favor and go buy some baking powder before you think of using this recipe"
2001846214,500502,2018/1/19,5,"My 3 year old has been begging for pancakes but my husband doesn't like them so I keep putting her off. Today, we made these when he went to work. She was able to help and had a blast. Delicious, easy to make, and kid/toddler approved."
2001942931,500502,2018/1/21,5,"No baking powder in the house and 3 kids begging for Saturday morning pancakes led me to this recipe. Super easy to make and very fast. They’re not huge and fluffy but they did not turn out gummy, dry, or dense like others have mentioned. A winner and one we will be keeping!"
2002068453,500502,2018/3/22,5,"No Baking Powder? No Problem! My family absolutely loved these pancakes! Genius Kitchen was discovered not that long ago by me as an app on my kids new tv and I’m so HAPPY I stumbled on it! Lots of great recipes...like these Easy peesy pancakes, yum!"
2002134542,500502,2018/4/29,4,"They were pretty good - fluffy enough that my husband didn’t notice the difference - but I made a few significant modifications: I used 1 Tablespoon baking soda because other online sources said I needed to use 3x or 4x more soda to substitute for baking powder. (Mark Bittman’s pancake recipe, which also has 2c flour, calls for 2t baking powder so I went with 1 Tablespoon, which was 2x.) I also used 1/4 cup yogurt instead of some of the milk, which other sources said was necessary. Next time I might try the full 3x baking soda, as they were a tad chewy. I always find the full two cups milk is necessary (or 1.75 cups and .25 cups yogurt)."
2002232408,500502,2018/7/28,5,I realized we didn't have any waffles left in the freezer so decided to make use of the flour in the cabinet and this reciped turned out great for my kids. They had no complaints so thank you for sharing! I enjoyed them as well!
305531,537458,2018/12/7,5,"Yummy potatoes. These are really simple to make and delish. So creamy and good. Thanks for sharing, Bonnie."
107135,502712,2013/8/26,5,i like using a blender for making these good pancake zwt9
461834,504807,2013/8/4,5,"Just loved this steak!!!  I made this as written, but scaled back for 1 pound of meat and I subbed flank steak as I don&#039;t care for cube steak, but DH had the cube steak.   We cooked the meats on the grill and the onions in a cast iron skillet on the grill, kept the kitchen cooler.  I served this with recipe#222273 and a tossed salad for a wonderful meal!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
1801190285,508157,2013/12/23,4,This is a a simple and tasty dessert!  The recipe fills a standard 12 cupcake pan perfectly.  I lined the cups with foil liners and used a single gingersnap cookie as the crust.  I baked them for 25 minutes then cooled and refrigerated them as in the directions.  They&#039;re the perfect size for dessert!
2001632794,498147,2017/7/18,5,"the ingredients list does not include it, but i swear there are mustard seeds in this. That is why I love it."
37449,498147,2013/4/12,5,A delicious and healthy salad! I used garbanzo beans in place of the mung beans. Thanks! Made for PRMR game.
1397274,498147,2014/5/25,0,What a hit at a BBQ. Really didn&#039;t want to make potato salad but something more healthy and fresh tasting. This is really good; had mung beans and red lentils (can buy both by the pound at Whole Foods) but didn&#039;t add them for no particular reason. Everyone wanted the recipe!
2000185595,498147,2015/5/5,5,"This recipe looks great, I love the quinoa salad at the Costco near me but it also includes kale and lists &quot;sugar&quot; in the ingredients."
2000270054,498147,2015/6/14,0,Looks like a great recipe. Can&#039;t wait to try it.  Only thing is the Qunioa salad I got at Costco had cumin in it too.
191378,498147,2015/6/19,5,I bought this salad today at Costco&#039;s.  It does not list sugar or cumin in the ingredients.
2000866869,498147,2016/2/9,4,Great recipe but the nutritional information seems to be way off... If anyone can make sense please share.
2000756635,498147,2017/3/5,0,Yest!
2002185128,498147,2018/6/13,3,"Good recipe, but Costco’s salad also has kale and brown rice. Yours does not. Your recipe has scallions, while Costco does not. I have their salad and label in front of me and it is different than yours."
2001629593,531182,2017/10/25,5,I have tried many recipes and this is my family's favorite!
2001420574,498483,2017/3/6,3,MY FRENCH TOAST LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THIS! 5 STARS!
2002070926,530409,2018/3/31,4,"Made this pizza today, and it turned out pretty great! I added a bit more toppings though: tomato sauce, vegan cheese (a local brand), tomato slices, bell pepper and some basil (which as you can see in the picture looks a bit crumpled but eh... whatever, still tastes great). One thing though, the dough was a bit hard on the edges. I guess I made it too thin? Nevertheless it didn't ruin the pizza at all. One thing I wish for though is that hopefully one day manufacturers finally figure out the perfect vegan cheese formula, cause they do have a bit of a weird taste..."
2001297534,530551,2017/6/24,4,I made this recipe as written with the exception of making 2 servings instead of 6. It was easy to put together and had a lot of flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
2549237,498376,2013/4/23,3,"This was ok, although I felt that the pork was a little dry at the end of cooking and no one liked the sauce that you were supposed to drizzle over the pork.  I will make this again, without the salt and I will reduce the cook time slightly.  Thank you for an interesting pork for my dinner tonight.  Made for Photo Tag Spring 2013."
339260,506561,2013/10/5,4,"Very simple and comforting dish.  Unfortunately I found out that I was out of onions so I threw in some baby carrots instead.  I added ham broth base and seasoning to the water and a little crushed red pepper.  I let it cook on low while I was at work.  When I came home, the potatoes weren&#039;t quite done so I turned it up to high for another hour.  This completely filled my 6-quart crock pot.  I enjoyed some for dinner, gave half to my in-laws (it is one of their favorite meals), and still had some leftovers for myself.  Made for My Three Chefs October 2013."
2000837234,506561,2016/1/24,5,"Just excellent!  It&#039;s wonderful comfort food for the winter, especially.  It reminds me of the meals I had as a child.  Prep is easy, and it&#039;s not too costly."
2000817159,518072,2016/1/13,4,This is legit a no fail cake recipe for high altitude. It was so deliciously moist and soft. Loved it!
2000934909,518072,2016/3/23,5,"I live in Aurora, Colorado (5,471 ft above see level) and I&#039;ve had plenty of fails trying to bake in this altitude.  I wanted to make cupcakes and came across this recipe.  It is delicious and definitely works in high altitude.  This recipe makes about 28 cupcakes.  The only change I made was decreasing both the baking powder and baking soda to just 1 teaspoon each instead of the called for 1 teaspoon and 1/4. I baked them for 14 minutes at 375 degrees and these turned out perfect. This will be my go to recipe for chocolate cake."
2001012210,518072,2016/5/15,5,"I have been using the best recipe from Hershey's for years. We recently moved from Kansas City to Castle Rock, CO. My long-time, go-to cake recipe was an epic failure at the higher altitude. I found this one adapted for me. Thank you so much!"
2001341319,518072,2017/1/7,5,This is the second time I have used this recipe and both times it has turned out delicious. I'm in Albuquerque with an altitude of 5000'. I made cupcakes this time and over filled them just a little. Getting ready to frost them.
2001950657,518072,2018/1/24,5,Sure looks and smells wonderful!! 5300 feet up in the San Bernardino mountains I Lake Arrowhead.

However, as a supportive wife, I am trying to join my husband in the journey. THIS bbq sauce is outstanding! Just as fine as the KC Masterpiece we were used to for years and years and years. Thank you!"
2001918835,524790,2018/1/7,0,"Great recipe, how long will it keep in the fridge?"
1803003609,517701,2014/8/7,5,So quick and simple!

2002219147,536360,2018/7/30,5,Out of this world crust so buttery and Flaky! Love the pie I could not stop eating!
2002247393,531471,2018/8/14,0,My guys requested it so I tried it....
58104,501160,2013/6/21,4,"I made this using 1/3 cup ranch dressing adding lime juice and zest 1/2 teaspoon fresh grated ginger. It was plenty so I suggest to cut the dip in half to keep it less fattening. I shaped my croquettes into Cylindrical shape but Circular would work with this recipe because it call to pan fry where the cylinder would be best deep fried. These are very coco-nutty. A nice thing. Adding some red pepper flakes, scallions, chives, or diced onion would really kick this up. After frying the first batch I placed in a warm oven to keep warm. I did end up serving these in lettuce with choice of herbs (Italian basil, tulsi/Holy basil) I made 14 Croquettes. My DH said three stars I say 4. Like the lime flavor. Thanks."
2549237,514566,2014/5/5,5,"Very good and super easy for our Cinco de Mayo celebration tonight!  Our family really loves Mexican food and this one didn&#039;t disappoint.  My husband normally doesn&#039;t like sweet potatoes, but he ate these up without complaining once and actually went back for seconds, which make this a true winner.  My kids and I love sweet potatoes, so any way that I can get my husband to eat them is sure to be a repeat in the dinner rotations at our house.  I paired this with Spanish rice, refried beans with queso and salad for a lovely dinner tonight.  Thank you ForeverMama!  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
486725,514566,2016/10/6,5,"Perfect combination. Always love black beans, sweet potato and red pepper together. I made a half recipe, but still used the whole can of beans (so doubled the cumin and chili powder). We also made these non-dairy, so left out the cheese - and didn't miss it. These have a nice balance of all the different flavors."

2001281162,529308,2016/12/4,5,Great!!!!
219942,503941,2013/7/17,4,"These were very good, and different than other zucchini cakes I&#039;ve made in the past, with the addition of the feta cheese. Feta is a strong cheese, and I only had 1/2 cup package, so I used that, and found it to be enough. Anymore would have been overpowering to me, but then that&#039;s just me. We loved the yummy browned butter taste, and the texture was perfect. This was an easy recipe, and they only took a couple minutes per side to brown perfectly. ZWT9"
329769,503941,2013/7/18,5,Reviewed for ZWT9- these were a lovely simple zucchini pancake that were easy to make and tasted great. I enjoyed the feta and mint combo. Served with recipe#472507 for a lovely Greek style vege lunch. Photo also to be posted
80353,503941,2013/7/20,5,"We love &#039;kolokithokeftedes&#039; and this version is quite authentic.  I did add one small, finely-minced onion to the mixture.  The feta and mint make it uniquely greek and so good.  Also served with tzatziki to scoop on or dip into."
480195,503941,2013/7/24,5,"Great flavor! I added 2 saut&eacute;ed shallots to the mix. Served as part of a Greek style buffet, with a dollop of tzaziki on top. They were all eaten up quick. Thanks for the recipe."
128473,503941,2013/7/26,5,"These zucchini pancakes are wonderful.  So crisp, tender, flavorful, bright and fresh.  I added a little minced onion to the mix.  All the flavors really popped.  I garnished these tasty treats with thick Greek yogurt and freshly ground black pepper,  Quick and really easy to make. Loved the fresh mint in these pancakes.  Made for ZWT9."
323186,503941,2013/7/29,5,"Lovely way to do zucchini, easily prepared,  delicious little snacks that don&#039;t last long!!!    Thank you momaphet, made and enjoyed for ZWT9, Panthers On the Prowl."
482933,503941,2013/9/25,4,Nice recipe. A bit salty for our taste. Next time I would use unsalted butter to fry them. Mint is very subtle.  Thank you for sharing.
2399085,502984,2013/9/19,5,This was great. Better than expected as we aren&#039;t big fans of Pesto. Had a nice crisp flavor! Made for PRMR! THANKS
865936,502984,2014/8/19,5,"This sandwich is great.  With so many flavors going on, it actually has so many flavors going on.  It is well balance and you can taste everything in it.  The only change I made was to put the pesto on the bread instead of mix it in the pan with the other ingredients."
486725,502984,2015/1/14,5,"Oh, wow! Super good. We used less of the crushed red pepper and more basil, and omitted the mozzarella (the feta was plenty of cheese for us). The pesto and feta really make this sandwich special. We really enjoyed the combination. Thank you!"
2000949191,535327,2018/5/21,4,"This looked like a very tasty meal, and with a couple of tweaks (out of necessity), turned out very nicely, served over farfelle."
2000554894,523759,2015/11/15,5,"Recipe was simple, and delicious. I did not need the full amount of cornstarch to thicken."
951133,523759,2016/5/18,5,"I made this last night and we LOVED it!!! The flavor is delightful and the chicken thighs were so tender! I used 2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs and French's Dijon mustard and followed the directions exactly. If you're not sure of the mustard then cut the amount in half but do try this!!! For some reason the sauce didn't thicken up to my liking so next time I will probably double the cornstarch or cook the sauce in a saucepan over heat. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!"
135470,506893,2014/3/26,3,For us these were just ok. I liked the lemon flavor but we had issues with the texture. Even with adjusting the temperature I found the insides to be a bit gummy and cooking them more just made the outsides too hard. Made for PRMRT
220348,493260,2013/1/31,5,"These were so moist and delicious! I found them somewhere in between crepes and pancakes, partly because they were a little too dense to be crepes, but not as dense as panckaes, so they ended up being like light pancakes to me. I don't like putting powdered sugar on these kinds of recipes, so I skipped that, and just added the maple syrup. So good!"
128473,493260,2013/4/2,5,"These Pfannekuchens were incredible.  I enjoyed this tasty treat so much.  They had a great texture and the flavor was out of this world.  Quick and easy to make with ingredients always found in the pantry.  I&#039;m so pleased that i found this recipe, I will be making this often.  Made for Pac Spring Safari."
1800325286,499434,2013/11/25,5,Literally just finished making these.  Just exactly like a biscuit!!  Turned a nice colour and has a great texture.  I used Bob Red Mill mix.  Otherwise did recipe exactly and am so grateful to find something bread-like to make for Thanksgiving this year.
2746773,497429,2013/3/22,5,Looks yummy!
2201427,497429,2013/3/20,5,Wow!!!  Such tasty little bites..... loaded with flavor!  Great recipe!!
2000192509,494460,2015/5/8,5,"I have never been able to make what I considered good blueberry muffins and I was very proud of the way this recipe turned out. Very moist and flavorful. I did not have enough yogurt, so I used some yogurt , some sour cream and some plain kefir. I also added a bit more poppy seeds and a squeeze of lemon juice. So good. I want to make them again right now."
1802581352,507597,2015/2/26,4,"Found this recipe while looking for a low carb version of eggplant parmesan. Made the first batch following the recipe pretty closely except I used my own favorite homemade sauce, but it actually turned out too watery for the finished product. The flavor c ame out pretty good &amp; even my hubs liked it. The amount of mozzarella seemed a bit excessive to me, but next time I make this dish, I plan to spread half of the mozzarella beneath the marinara and the other half above it."
169430,502328,2013/7/2,5,This is actually almond horchata as the strawberry is a garnish. It&#039;s still delicious and it made a lovely light breakfast this morning. I put it all together last night and let it chill in the fridge until this morning. It&#039;s not at all difficult and yields a delicious glass of goodness.
1783373,500461,2013/8/18,4,This was a very nice blueberry cake.  Nice flavor and I love it how it contains coconut milk.  The issue I found is that for the average size bundt pan it wasn&#039;t enough batter because end result was a low height cake.  Next time I&#039;ll either use a smaller bundt cake pan or increase batter.  Overall good flavor.  Thank you lolablitz!
136997,512577,2014/2/8,5,Thumbs up and a &quot;tasty&quot; comment from my husband. Won&#039;t get any better than that. Made for New Kids on the Block Tag Game. :)
1802595947,514448,2014/3/18,5,This is a delicious and easy dish!  Simply Potatoes makes the prep work super simple!
1802595955,514448,2014/3/18,5,"I saw this, and i had to try it.  It was DELICIOUS and a cinch to whip up!!!!!!"
1802601542,514448,2014/3/20,0,"OH my gosh!!! This dish is delicious. Cooking for a family of four while working a full time job, it is so difficult to find nutritious easy to make dishes. This one tops the charts. It&#039;s my family&#039;s favorite."
314579,517531,2014/8/28,4,"I liked this and really enjoyed it with chimichurri sauce and panko for the breading.  My only critique, mine needed more salt.  Thanks for posting Jackie!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
2000431901,530157,2017/8/7,4,"Really tasty! There was a bit too much liquid, probably released from the zucchini once it started cooking. I'd either use only 1/4 cup water in the sauce, or salt the zoodles to draw the water off before adding them."
2001813321,530157,2018/3/24,1,"I did not care for this. The first bite or two were very flavorful, but then it became a thick, sweet, salt-bomb. But that’s how Chinese food often leaves me feeling, so maybe it’s me. I won’t make this again."
2002084905,530157,2018/3/30,3,"Decent flavor, but not my favorite. I want to echo DianaEatingRichly to say there was a little too much liquid, so a little less water would help, in my opinion. She suggests to only do 1/4 cup of water, and I definitely plan to try that myself next time."
1620171,499353,2013/6/29,4,"This was quite nice, I did find that the liquid evaporated a bit too quickly (at the one hour mark, it was nearly dry) so we added some more wine and stock to moisten it up. I think the cooking time was a little too long for the amount of sauce as the rabbit was a little dry. Otherwise, the sauce was a lovely flavour and it looked great. Made for My Food Odyssey June 2013"
2807253,499353,2013/7/5,1,hated it
1802490677,506611,2017/3/8,0,Can you leave out the row tablespoon evaporated cane sugar?
2000887596,533033,2017/8/6,3,There is nothing &quot;Mediterranian&quot; about this grilled rib steak. Only the side dish. Should be renamed.
895132,499389,2014/4/16,4,"These are quite tasty cookies. I like that they have oil instead of butter or margarine, and that there are no fancy gluten free ingredients but gluten free &quot;staples&quot; used. They are a bit dry, though, and the taste of the soda is a tad too strong for my linking. Maybe my brown rice flour is not fine enough, I&#039;ll play with the recipe and try using half brown rice flour and half sweet rice flour, and maybe decrease the amount of soda a bit and use a bit more baking powder instead. Thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
323186,503616,2013/7/15,5,"Good rice, very easily made, I love pine nuts so for me that is a great addition, and the dill and mint lend flavour and aroma.   All in all, lovely, enjoyed for ZWT9, thank you morgainegeiser!"
133174,503616,2013/7/17,5,"The rice was brown rice, Recipe #177017, using chicken stock in place of the water.  Once the rice was cooked the dish was super quick to put together.  I did toss in the pine nuts a few minutes before the onion was done to allow them to toast as well.  This was served with Recipe #460368 and Recipe #427739 for a delicious Greek meal.  Made for ZWT9."
251917,503616,2014/5/27,5,Aussie Swap #88: One of my favorite recipe dishes to date! I love how simple yet full of flavor this dish is! The pine nuts take this rice to another level - the crunch and nutty flavor - AWESOME!
486725,504355,2014/12/3,5,"The marinated artichokes totally make this! I subbed meatballs for the sausage and omitted the bell pepper (personal preference). It came out good, we really liked the flavors together."
653438,509005,2014/4/23,5,"What an easy and quick pizza.  I used spicy turkey sausage and homemade pizza sauce from this site, added some slivered red onions  and followed the rest of the instructions.  When you&#039;re in a hurry this pizza makes a great meal...just add a green salad.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
2002176334,536012,2018/6/30,0,can you use wonton wrappers instead of pasta dough?
2748334,495298,2013/3/22,5,"My husband suggested to make this for Valentines day after he heard it from NPR  &quot;An Italian-Inspired Valentine&#039;s Feast From &#039;Nigellissima&#039;&quot; ... I  have made it about 4x since.  It&#039;s now my go-to recipe for steak.  Simple but very flavorful.  I like to eat it with arugula, using the sauce/drippings as dressing."
379033,495298,2014/2/28,5,"I have made this recipe quite often since I seen it aired on the Chew. It is fabulous!!! Great flavors. I have omitted the cherry tomatoes before. And I like to cook my steak just a little bit longer than suggested. I still like it pink inside, just not rare. All in all, a great recipe!! Thanks for sharing Kerena."
178229,495298,2014/6/3,0,What a great little recipe. Steak was wonderful &amp; tender. Love the &quot;suace&quot;. I have made this several times now &amp; have also grated a garlic clove into the oil. I served it on a bed of rocket for additional pepperiness.
2000248745,517162,2015/6/4,5,"Delish!  My husband and son both loved it as well.  The only thing I don&#039;t care for is the ridiculous amount of sodium because everything is canned.  I might substitute some fresher, low sodium alternatives next time."
2180168,517162,2014/7/15,5,LOVE this!! So simple to throw together. So many ways to spice up &amp; down for individual tastes. Freezes very well!
247121,517162,2014/12/19,5,"I was &#039;short on time&#039;, so I found this recipe, cooked the chicken pieces, threw everything in the crockpot, put it on high for 5hrs, and Oh Boy!  My husband raved and my very &quot;picky eater&quot; daughter went for seconds!  I love how easy and great tasting this Chicken Chili is.  It&#039;s now a permanent recipe in my book!"
1803609915,517162,2015/1/4,5,"This is delicious and easy. I only added one can of corn and used 2 cans great northern beans since I didn&#039;t have any navy beans on hand.    Also, I substituted the taco seasoning with 1 tsp of homemade taco seasoning blend.  We will be making this again soon!"
417718,517162,2015/1/8,2,Did not care for this recipe. Way too many onions and corn.  Followed recipe exactly and it turned out too soupy.
1803698087,517162,2015/1/24,0,"I used this recipe but changed a few things to make it appeal to my hubby. Instead o adding corn and two onions, I used 1 onion and added fazool noodles to the chili. I also added some cheese into the pot and stirred occasionally. Tasted SUPER yummy!!"
47559,503666,2013/7/17,5,Top shelf Greek Salad all the way.  Loved the mint.  Made for ZWT 9 for Mike and the Appliance Killers.
47892,503666,2013/7/23,5,"Refreshing and good! I used lettuce and tomatoes from our CSA box and fresh mint from our garden. I toasted pita bread halves in the toaster instead of heating up the house using the oven. Served with Recipe #427234, a platter of fresh fruit that included green and red grapes and fresh locally grown strawberries. Made for ZWT 9."
1269180,504524,2013/10/25,5,"Easy, and absolutely gorgeous! I will never have plain roast pork again! Going to try half onion, half apple in the stuffing next time..."
183964,504921,2015/5/22,5,Great crunchy batter! Love it! It&#039;s just like the kind of batter I like to make.
2737010,497373,2013/3/14,5,"Absolutely delicious!   I couldn&#039;t find knot rolls, so I used light, flaky dinner rolls.  I aso used thick cut bacon.  Was so crispy and gooey.  Good for a crowd, too."
2759067,497373,2013/3/28,5,this recipe is awesome.  the taste is amazing. just the right amount of carbohydrates to kick start the day. easy recipe to follow. thanks for the recipe. i cant believe there are not more reviews. its a keeper.
679953,509251,2013/12/23,5,"The only major change was that I used whole wheat flour, and they ended up nice, and fluffy.  They all rose real nice, and ended up having this with a small ham with these.  My kids especially enjoyed them due to the onions, and my DS and I enjoyed the bacon and the onions.  All in all a great addition to dinner.  Made for PRMR Tag."
679953,502246,2015/2/12,5,"I have my share of Buff. Wild Wings before and after I was married, but these were outstanding..  not much for mustard, but the rest of the ingredients blended with the mustard very well.  Great with the fries we had with tonight... A Keeper  :).  Made for FYC."
1458727,502246,2013/6/28,5,"WOW!  These wings were out of this world good.  No changes needed.  I used Siracha hot chili sauce for the hot pepper sauce.  I was tempted to double the sauce, glad I didn&#039;t, did not need to.  It was not drippy, just perfect.  A ten star recipe for sure.  Thank You"
2597942,502246,2013/7/2,5,Wow-zah!!! I made these for dinner and hubby and I devoured all but the 2 I hid from him to eat for lunch the next day! I will update this post in a while when my internet is running better. But they are excellent with proper cooking! Thank you for posting this. We will use this many more times (but basting with it 1/2 way thru! Its kinda like a Carolina sauce that I make). Made for PRMR
212609,502246,2013/12/15,5,"Five stars for this recipe is somewhat mean...these wings deserve a solid TEN!!!&lt;br/&gt;These got devoured in double quick time.&lt;br/&gt;The wings were crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside, and the sauce was just amazing...sweet, mustardy with a touch of heat...all perfectly balanced and finger licking good!!&lt;br/&gt;A sure fire winner in our book....many thanks Teresa.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR,"
266635,502246,2015/2/2,5,I took these wings to my Super Bowl get-together yesterday and everyone enjoyed them. They were a nice change to the typical hot wings that are normally served.  The combination of the mustards really added a nice flavor to the sauce - no changes made.  Made for the For Your Consideration tag game.
128473,502246,2015/5/3,5,"No wonder these tasty wings are one of your favorites.  They are so good.  Quick and so easy to make with wonderful results.  I baked mine in the oven and made your wonderful sauce.  So good, made as written but did add some extra hot sauce. (personal preference only) These were amazing, my new favorite wing recipe. Kudos to you Teresa for making it into my Best of Cookbook for 2015.  These babies rock....I will be making these often. Thank you so much for sharing.  Wish I could give them more than 5 star&#039;s, they deserve 10..... Made FYC Tag Game."

226863,502246,2015/7/11,5,"I did 3 pounds instead of 2 for 2....my son eats for 3!!  Or 4!  Wonderful flavor and crispness.  A little sticky from the honey, but at least the sauce sticks to the wings!  A great flavor change for wings that I&#039;ll enjoy again.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for FYC tag game."
2666824,494370,2013/1/30,5,Very tasty recipe!  You can't go wrong with bacon
2665256,494370,2013/1/31,5,"Love this recipe!! I made it for dinner last night & it was delicious. Everyone loved it, which is amazing because it is so hard to find a meal the whole family enjoys! The little extra that was leftover heated up nicely today for lunch, which is a huge plus. Thanks for sharing!"
2684701,494370,2013/2/9,5,"Delicious casserole dinner!  A very tasty blend of flavors, which everyone agreed was a keeper.  Easy to make and wonderful reheated for leftovers."
2686160,494370,2013/2/10,5,This is a great family dinner recipe!  The different cheeses really made it a unique take on the traditional mac and cheese recipe.  It was nice to have some fresh greens hidden in there too!  Delicious!
900992,499003,2013/4/28,3,"This was good, but it was very difficult to deal with, took a lot of time to make, and really didn&#039;t turn out to be a pizza crust; it was more of a casserole once the pizza toppings were on it."
2000259636,514207,2015/6/10,4,"Great recipe! I loved it, stored readily for my lunch the next day at work! I did add some homemade spaghetti sauce over the top just to give it a little extra kick! But I will definitely make this again!!"
1803287292,500021,2016/10/3,5,Wonderful! I like this made into a sandwich. ..Yum!
865936,503695,2013/7/21,5,You would never guess from the flavors that this was an easy 30 minute meal. The only thing I did different was I used leftover rice instead of instant.
498271,505647,2013/8/19,5,"Fantastic chicken wings!  I cut off the tips and removed as much of the skin as I could.  I marinated for about 4 hours and used 1 tsp of crushed red pepper which for us was the perfect amount of heat and great with the sweet chili sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
2001474761,528358,2017/4/28,5,"Each Wed. I make dinner for the family, about 15-18 people, and deliver it to 2 different homes. This dinner last night was possible the best in years. Everyone went back for seconds and some fourth helping. People packed up the little remaining for Leftover Thursday. I tweak recipes according to what I have and what I can't find. I couldn't find Tamarind Paste or Chinkiang vinegar so I used more Rice vinegar and lots more peanut butter. I also added more vegetables, carrots, &amp; 4 colors of peppers. I wished I taken a picture because it was so colorful. Thanks for this delicious recipe. I have never followed a blog before but will definitely be watching yours."
1680722,501436,2013/12/17,5,"This is a great way to make the family happy!&lt;br/&gt;I had to prepare this in advance, for this reason I preapred the meatballs as described, then I mixed the drained orzo with the marinara sauce, added 1/2 cup of water and poured in the (big!) baking mold over the meatballs. I topped this with the crumbled feta and sent in the oven again until the feta was browned.&lt;br/&gt;My family enjoyed this lukewarm (lukewarm food is almost the standard in Greece) as they were at home.&lt;br/&gt;They loved this very much and loved this surprise!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this posting!"
1802635701,515151,2014/4/1,5,"Was easy to make and tasted great, thanks!"
1802635734,515151,2014/4/1,5,"Just made this for my kids and they loved it!  Served with chicken.  Great way to get them to eat some vegetables, and VERY easy to make.  Sharp cheddar is my favorite."
1802635725,515151,2014/4/1,5,"To preface, I&#039;m not one for enjoying cuisine outside of the pasta family, but when the words &quot;cheesy&quot; and &quot;fries&quot; are in the same sentence, you have my attention. Also, I lean on the side of convenience, so when I noticed the 10 minute prep time, I just became hungry. After making this recipe, the end result was as elegant as the picture displays, and yes, it tastes just as incredible as it looks. The sharp cheddar complements the potatoes sublimely, and the spinach and peppers bring it all together as one cohesive and simply delicious meal. I will be enjoying this weekly!"
1802635959,515151,2014/4/1,0,"This recipe is amazing and very simple to make. It&#039;s very delicious.

1802635958,515151,2014/4/1,5,I loved this recipe! As did the others who shared it with me. Perfect ratio of spinach and peppers to cheese- something that is clearly very important. It was also easy to make. I would definitely recommend it.
1802639913,515151,2014/4/3,5,So easy &amp; so delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe.
1802642191,515151,2014/4/4,5,Love this!! I&#039;m not big on cooking so when I find something easy to make and at the same time super delicious-- Awesome!! I plan on making this whenever I have guests over. Thank you for posting!!

1802649590,515151,2014/4/7,5,Made this last night and the whole family loved it! The kids were excited and didn&#039;t even nag about the spinach. Thank you! Will make it again!

2001456183,515151,2017/3/26,4,"Damn I didn't think it would turn out as good as it did. I found this recipe through supercook, as they would find a recipe with the ingredients I had available and i was out of ideas. As a broke college student, I can see myself eating this weekly. Inexpensive ingredients, straightforward instructions and a whole lotta taste! - the only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars is because i thought it needed a pinch of salt, so I added quest fresco from the mexican store on top."
2000431901,519595,2016/10/31,5,This is super easy and really tasty. I actually used a pressure cooker instead of the slow cooker setting and it was done in under an hour. Love it!
266635,496160,2014/5/3,5,"This recipe is absolutely awesome! : )  It is sooo easy to make, but tastes and looks like you spent hours on it.  I made a few changes -- left out the regular onions and only used green onions, left out the celery (just our preference), I used fresh sauteed mushrooms and we used large shrimp.  Will be making this dish often and I&#039;m adding it my Best of 2014 Cookbook as well.  Made for Spring PAC, May, 2014."

386585,503638,2013/7/22,5,"Wow - these are some tasty meatballs!  I made this almost exactly as posted, except I used ground beef instead of pork (personal preference).  I have sliced ham and sliced Genoa salami, which I diced up.  I did not have fontina, so used mozzarella instead.  These cooked up nicely (and quickly, I might add), and I ended up with 12 good-sized meatballs.  There were so many distinct flavors going on, but they worked together nicely.  Definitely a real treat!  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
599450,503638,2013/7/27,5,"These are great meatballs. Made as directed -- to the letter. Thanks, loof! Made for ZWT9 for team Gourmet Goddesses!"
695933,503638,2013/11/9,5,"I all-way like to made the recipe once as written, the way the chef did it. Absolutely Delicious, I love it. Couldn&#039;t have been happier with the way it turned out. That me...But someone can not have pork?Why? So I  have do it over So I used 1/2 lb ground beef instead of pork and1/2 lb ground lamb not ham  (personal preference). No green olives  I use a red  wine vinegar not white, Italian bread, 2 ounces brown sugar I got 14 nice sized meatballs. This way was good but not as Absolutely Delicious as yours. Some people can be so pickie and @#^$%!* sweet deer. Good Food but ONE bad guest. Cant wait to make this for a Pot luck! I will definitely make this again Your way Thank You for a Absolutely Delicious Recipe! Made for me. PRMR 2013 Thank You....Grpa"

165623,503638,2014/3/24,5,I had to make a few changes based to things I had on hand. I used Coppa and prosciutto instead of salami. I also used San Juan Parmesan cheese instead of fontina cheese. I didn&#039;t have milk so I added another egg and no bread so I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs. I also didn&#039;t have any green olives and I really wish that I would - next time I will make sure I have some as I think it would benefit from that flavor. I didn&#039;t have white wine vinegar so I used red wine garlic vinegar. Even with all these changes these were great. Thanks
226863,503638,2014/4/17,5,"Yummy! Yummy!  I made exactly as posted, and loved the fontina cheese in the meatballs....may have added a bit too much!  I was surprised at how quickly these were done.  Have to admit I used a meat thermometer since it was pork.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1803088765,518024,2014/8/31,5,Absolutely delicious!
1803088875,518024,2014/8/31,0,Delicious!  Well worth the time and effort to make!
220151,511846,2014/1/10,5,"The soup has a delicious taste  and very easy to make. I&#039;ve started this year with a new me and I&#039;m counting calories. I counted everything that went into the soup. And even though the chart says 261.30  it that actually come out 340.54, which was very close and I was very pleased with that. It also has 12 servings instead of 10. I appreciate you sharing; thank you very much. I also included a photo."
539686,504834,2013/8/2,5,"Cardamom is a flavor that is common to Swedish dishes, but even if you are not having a Scandinavian menu, this is fantastic. With the eggs, this is much like a frozen custard. We loved it! To lighten the fat a bit I used half and half instead of the heavy cream and also used 2% milk rather than whole milk. We didn&#039;t notice any lightness, it tasted very decadent and just a perfect use of our new ice cream machine! Thanks for posting, made for ZWT #9!"
2001656674,504834,2017/8/4,5,My wife loves cardamom so I found this recipe and made it for her. She can't get enough of it . In fact I made a batch last weekend and she's asked me to make another batch. No she did not eat it all by herself. It's a great flavor and it has a wonderful texture to the ice cream. I highly recommend making it yourself. 1 tip on freshly ground cardamom. You have to remove the seeds from the pods before you grind it. Maybe everyone knows this but I didn't. A mortar and pestel works best to grind the seeds. I tried it in a clean coffee grinder and the seeds just bounced around. They're too small to get effectively ground that way.
2001296318,529200,2016/12/13,4,"Great recipe but too much filling. I will double the cracker mixture to fill the cups in order to use all of the bean mixture. Yes, the molds are smaller then cupcakes but the ratio is still not there yet. I had to make a small side dish of regular casserole cuz there was so much left over filling. I might add mushrooms next time. Not sure where the milk was supposed to go in cuz it never appeared in the original recipe but all in all OUTSTANDING!! THANKS"
42378007,535651,2018/4/24,5,Cannot wait to try this!!
2389450,535651,2018/4/27,0,how long can you let it frement
2002070351,535651,2018/5/29,0,"I followed the instructions exactly. I'm giviing 1 star for visual appeal because it looks amazing. But I do not like the taste of this at all. I decided carrot and lime do not go well together in my book. I'll probably freeze it and add it to stews, little by little."
2000166897,519990,2015/4/26,4,This was a favorite when my son&#039;s were growing up. Nice to see my tastes haven&#039;t changed all that much. I made it with ground turkey and skipped  the crust. But I remember my boys loving the  crust. A simple recipe and a bit different because of the pickles. They add a nice flavor and a little crunch.
1783373,514388,2014/4/6,5,"So Fantastically GOOD!  It was good without the Malibu coconut rum, but when it was added it went over the top good!  This is a drink I most definitely will be making for when I have guests over and it&#039;s ever so easy to put together.  Even if you don&#039;t want to use the rum, like I said, it&#039;s just as good without it, but I can see how adding a touch of cream of coconut could substitute for the rum.  I can also see how this drink could adapt to using pineapple instead of mango if you so choose.  Thanks a million Annacia for a WINNER!"
865936,514388,2014/7/6,5,"Absolutely delicious!  I made it without the alcohol in a pitcher, then just added the pineapple rum by the glass so everyone could enjoy it whether they imbibe or not.  I buy those frozen fruit pulps so that make this so easy and convenient to make."
91584,494838,2014/5/15,5,Just what we were looking for! Excellent -very yummy :)
895132,503480,2013/8/23,5,"Easy and excellent! They tasted exactly the way I remember them from my dad who used to make them often. I never managed to get his recipe right, and this is it! Thanks for sharing, I&#039;ll make this often :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Morocco/Tunisia for The Apron String Travelers"
169430,503480,2013/8/25,5,Delicious. I had to use frozen okra and I omitted the sugar (personal choice) and it made a great side for a simple grilled chicken. Made for ZWT 9.
480195,503480,2013/8/25,5,"I make a very similar recipe once a month, but I tried yours and found that the flavor was better. I think the addition of just a bit of sugar and a little more lemon juice makes all the difference. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
2324285,500905,2013/6/30,5,"Great tacos!  I&#039;ve never had potatoes in tacos before- I liked them in there surprisingly.  I also loved your method of roasting poblano peppers; it was so much easier than how I&#039;ve been doing it for years.  I had enough &quot;filling&quot; for 12 tacos, and I used Cotija cheese instead of Manchego.  I also topped these with a generous amount of frech pico de gallo, because I just can&#039;t have Mexican tacos without fresh pico. [Made &amp; Reviewed for PRMR]"
486725,500905,2014/6/23,5,"Excellent tacos! I knew I had to try them since they sounded like my favorite ever tacos (Recipe #250054). I played around with the portions a bit, most notably using up all the soy chorizo we had in freezer (8 oz. lol, but it wasn&#039;t too spicy, surprisingly). Because of that I omitted the salt and cayenne. The flavors are all so delicious here, there is nothing not to like. I think that whole wedge of lime squeezed over each taco really makes them extra special too."
266635,500905,2015/7/25,5,Really tasty tacos -- made them for a late breakfast/brunch.  We love poblanos and especially potatoes in tacos.  I used cotija cheese and I omitted the salt in the cooking process.  Also used fire-roasted corn.  Really hit the spot.
227978,510766,2014/8/22,5,"Excellent bread!  It was not only quite flavorful, but it was moist and the outer crust was just perfect (toasted without being crumbly).

67728,510766,2014/8/29,5,"Very tasty bread! I had just made a small amount of instant mashed potatoes for this, and they might have been a little too dry, so I needed to add a bit of extra water to my dough because it was still really crumbly after the first knead cycle. Made the house smell awesome, and went over quite well with my coworkers. I served this with twissis&#039; Recipe#239332. The warm bread is really good all by itself, but the pizza butter went pretty well with it, too. Thanks for posting, Kate! Made by a fellow Merry Maid of Mayhem for Culinary Quest I"
169430,510766,2014/9/20,5,I had leftover mashed potatoes in the fridge for several days and needed to use them up. Finding this recipe was a gift. I made it this morning and much enjoyed a toasted (and it sliced and toasted beautifully) slice topped with a poached egg for breakfast this morning. The bread was a delight with great flavor and I&#039;m looking forward to a sandwich with it at lunch. Dee-licious! Made for Culinary Quest 2014.

804550,500355,2013/12/1,5,"Yum! These were wonderful.

2000605688,518952,2016/1/23,3,"The pancakes were a little too sweet for my taste, so I recommend putting melted butter instead of the oil. However, the pancakes gave me the best brown I&#039;ve ever seen, and the milk powder gave them a unique taste."

169430,506828,2014/4/24,5,"As I was making this just for myself I lowered the amount to one serving and used a lamb shank. I still followed the meat removal and all but only had the time to marinate for 2 hrs so I added a bit of strong chicken broth. It worked just fine and the finished dish utterly delicious. I make the  ras el hanout from a recipe here on food and always keep it on hand. I&#039;ll make this again when I have time to let it marinate overnight but I can&#039;t imagine it being much better.

DH was eating this while I was doing dishes and at the first bite yelled out &quot;Wow - this is one of the best desserts I've ever had!&quot;. What?

I never tried it, and I was determined to get it.  With that being said, I used the jelly, egg roll wrappers, and goat cheese for the options, and these made for a great little brunch treat after church today.  Cooking time was right on the dot, and the rolls itself were nice and soft too.  This would be great as a side to any mex. dinner.  Made for PRMR tag."

They are like eating little bites of candy.  To try to trim some of the calories I did use Splenda brown sugar and although the bacon is a major ingredient in this recipe I will probably cut that in half.   (or maybe not)  I used French style frozen beans but I think next time I&#039;ll use the whole green bean.  Thank you so much for sharing this fantastic recipe.  Made for PRMR

1680722,517430,2014/9/14,5,"I had a lot of fun preparing this beautiful bread. I prepared the dough with the listened ingredients and I used one half of the dough to prepared a simple (not filled) braided bread for the breackfast. With the second half I prepared the poppy filled one. I rolled out the dough to the size of 60 to 40 cm I spread the self prepared poppy seed filling (I had the seeds at home and I found it easier than going out to look for this). I rolled it to a cilinder and formed a wheel on a baking sheet. I brushed the bread with half beaten egg (the other half I used it in the filling), I let it sit for almost one hour and just before baking I mad the incisions.&lt;br/&gt;After baking I dusted it with one teaspoon baking powder.&lt;br/&gt;Wonderful and so beautiful!"
305531,503061,2013/8/3,5,Yum. It doesn&#039;t get any easier than this. I marinated a rib eye steak for about 4 hours and then grilled it. Such a nice flavor without being overbearing. I still have enough left to try it on something else too. Thanks CaliforniaJan for sharing. Made for ZWT9.

Definitely worth having again, though not too soon after the holidays! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made and reviewed in New Kids on the Block]"

1803286168,510874,2014/11/1,5,I tried this tonight and I thought it was great.  I cooked it for 35 minutes.
1931382,510874,2014/12/21,5,This is delish.  Made it this morning and I&#039;ll have breakfast for a week.  Next time I will add some bacon in with the sausage.  This also froze well.
398275,510874,2015/6/25,5,I&#039;ve made quite a few breakfast casseroles in my time and this is definitely the BEST!  I&#039;ve made it so often I now know the recipe by heart.  Perfect comfort food.  Thanks for sharing!

690375,510874,2016/1/15,5,"Wonderful and so easy!  I precooked the sausage the night before and saved the scrapings for gravy the next day.   I&#039;ll admit and fess up that I fiddled with the recipe a bit.  Used 16 oz Grands pull apart biscuits and cut them up very small.  Used 1 lb of Jimmy Dean ssg and 1/2 lb of spicy Italian ssg.  Added fine chop sweet onion to the sausage/grease, cooked until soft.
Definitely not a low cal, healthy meal, but it was especially great on a cold night served with fruit salad.  The Mr. had three helpings and asked for it to be added to the &quot;A&quot; list of recipes.....meaning &quot;The Again List&quot;.
I did the math and by buying some store brands plus items on sale, it cost about $10. We ended up with 4 large dinner servings and four medium servings for lunch leftovers.  
Excellent !!"

I also cut my biscuits into 4 little wedges and that helps them to cook through more as well. Hope that helps next time! :)"

2001244486,510874,2016/11/13,5,This was a big hit at our church breakfast. I increased the cheese to 2 cups and added 2 extra eggs. I only baked it for 35 minutes. Turned out perfectly!

2001397111,510874,2017/2/18,5,My cousin made something like this for a family Christmas brunch. I came home and found this recipe. The only thing I added was a drizzle of pure maple syrup on top of the gravy. It is a hit with my boys - even the one that doesn't like biscuits &amp; gravy.

502302,493702,2013/1/28,5,"This is so great!!! And I'm proud to say that I have all the ingredients in my pantry. I even bought lentils in bulk but don't really crave them. As usual, I didn't move fast enough and started the crock too late to cook on low. Cooked on high for about 3 hrs and it was starting to get dry and crusty on the outside. I have a feeling this might happen even on low because the liquid didn't seem enough. I may add more next time or just wait and add more toward the end of cooking time (to help mix in the salt)."
169430,493702,2015/2/8,5,"I made this yesterday and I think I&#039;m addicted. I now want to eat it every day! I did add some extra liquid about half way through as it seemed to be absorbing a lot, not a big problem. The outcome is a delicious dish with beautiful textures and mouth feel and lots of flavor. It only needed a small green side salad and a fresh apple for dessert to make what I consider a perfect meal. Kudo&#039;s for a true keeper that I have printed and stashed to keep on hand."
2001603312,499790,2018/4/15,5,"I'm thinking &quot;This better be good.&quot; as I combine time, effort and $15 worth of ingredients into making the sauce. WOW! First use in a recipe and I knew there will always be a jar in the fridge."

2708020,495202,2013/2/23,5,Crunchy Valley Chicken is delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I had left over quinoa so I used that instead of the rice and it was still good.  The Hidden Valley Ranch dressing added just the right amount of flavor and the almonds add a nice crunch!
2708127,495202,2013/2/23,5,"I prepared this for the first time today and my husband and I both loved it.  There are two keys to its appeal to me.  First the Hidden Valley Ranch Seasoning mixed in the vegetables, chicken seasoning and the topping adds wonderful flavor throughout.   Secondly the panko bread crumbs crisped up beautifully with the almonds to top off this dish with a tasty crunch."
2708309,495202,2013/2/23,5,Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser.  The variety of flavors and textures made the dish unique.  Served to family and friends and everyone gave it 5 stars!

2710832,495202,2013/2/25,5,Loved this recipe!  The crunchiness of the waterchestnuts and the sweetness of the cranberries made a perfect combination for this hearty chicken casserole.  Easily made with ingredients you can pull out of the pantry on a moments notice to create a truly enjoyable dinner.
2710991,495202,2013/2/25,5,So good!!! Flavors are wonderful!!!
2711100,495202,2013/2/25,5,"Delicious!  Wonderful crunchy texture, too."
2711102,495202,2013/2/25,5,Very tasty.   Fantastic.   The almonds and cranberries provide the perfect combination with the cream.
2711109,495202,2013/2/25,5,"This dish was easy to rate ""Outstanding.""  The texture and taste orchestrated together, hit a perfect note to the taste buds.  The only word of caution one needs to heed when enjoying this dish - is to give it a chance to cool.  And that is the most difficult aspect to this creation."
2711124,495202,2013/2/25,5,It was delicious!  The dried cranberries and water chestnuts gave this dish an added tartness and crunch.  I'm certain the whole family would enjoy the texture and creaminess of this home cooked meal!
2711130,495202,2013/2/25,5,"Absolutely yummy! The dish had all sorts of flavors bursting through. I would make this for my family anytime. The crunch of each bite made it wonderful. What a great recipe for any day, a family gathering or a dinner party."
2711139,495202,2013/2/25,5,"A wonderful new twist to chicken casserole, loved the hint of ranch dressing and added texture of the water chestnuts and cranberries.  I used FF Mayo and low-fat greek yogurt, which helped reduce the fat.    Plus I found it served more like 6-8 people in my house when paired with a side salad.  This recipe is a keeper."
2711155,495202,2013/2/25,5,Great recipe! Love the crunch and the flavors.
2711150,495202,2013/2/25,5,This recipe is delicious!  The combination of flavors is a crowd pleaser that will ensure success at any dinner party.  I will definitely add this recipe to my personal collection for family and friends.
2711169,495202,2013/2/25,5,"Delicious!  Each bite held a new flavor ""surprise"" and a variety of textures. Easy enough for weeknight dinner or great for entertaining."
2711174,495202,2013/2/25,5,Loved it!  A mouthwatering array of flavor!  I can't wait to fix this for my family.
2711178,495202,2013/2/25,5,"Creamy AND crunchy ... what a great combination! Greek yogurt adds a rich, smooth base of 'comforting feel' while the water chestnuts, bread crumbs and almonds provide amazing crunch. However, tender chicken, made better with the special flavors of Hidden Valley Ranch, was the real star of this show! Loved it !"
2711215,495202,2013/2/25,5,"So many different flavors!  I love ranch, so I enjoyed it very much!!"
2704325,495202,2013/2/25,5,"Delightful!  Every bite seemed to burst with flavors leaving you saying, ""wow!""  I would definitely try this recipe myself!"
2711219,495202,2013/2/25,5,"Loved the dish!  The sweet, the crunch and, of course, the bite size chicken makes it appealing to kids as well as adults.<br/>Won't change a thing!"
2711351,495202,2013/2/25,5,5 stars!
2710258,495202,2013/2/25,5,"Wonderful combination of ingredients,love the unexpected taste of the cranberries and the crunchiness of the water chestnuts. Seasonings are just right. My husband even had seconds and he usually doesn't care for casseroles. Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe."
2718956,495202,2013/3/2,5,"Just found our next ""go to"" casserole for my family.  Even my two very picky eaters loved it and that's a real compliment because they are very hard to please.  The Hidden Valley Ranch adds the most wonderful flavor to this unusal casserole.  Loved the crunch of the water chestnuts and the hint of sweetness with the dried cranberries.  Very easy to prepare."
323186,522710,2015/8/4,5,"Very easy to prepare and delicious, my husband thought I had made a lot of rice, but worked his way though it in no time at all!!   Much enjoyed, thank you for sharing, made for Culinary Quest 2015 (Switzerland) for Lightbulbs On The Beach"
1783373,512747,2014/2/16,4,The flavor in this Indian pudding reminds me of Boston Brown Bread.  We served it hot with vanilla ice cream as suggested.  The flavor of the molasses is quite pronounced and I would suggest using unsulfured molasses and replacing some of the molasses quantity with regular sugar.  This is a nice old fashioned desert that partakes in our history!  Made it for PRMR tag game.  Thank you rpgaymer.
169430,505591,2013/8/17,5,"The weather forecast when I got up this morning said 36c (97f) so I got busy and made this up right away. It was part of a simple cold dinner that included Recipe #505499 and purchased flat bread. It really hit the spot this very warm evening. Easy to make and and yummy, made with things I always have on hand I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll revisit this. Made for ZWT 9."
895132,505410,2013/8/15,5,"Quick, easy and delicious! DH said four stars, which is high praise from someone who doesn&#039;t care for tofu at all :) I used tamari instead of the low sodium soy sauce but otherwise followed the directions exactly. Will make this again. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / SE Asia for The Apron String Travelers"
2000841413,505821,2016/1/27,5,This cake was awesome!! So rich and moist. My niece and husband said it was the best chocolate cake they ever had! I am new at baking and this turned out perfect! Topped it with homemade chocolate frosting and mini chocolate chips!!  It was gone in a day!! We loving named it: Decadently Delecious Double Layer Triple Chocolate Cake!!!
46231180,529735,2018/4/2,1,too too much sugar
2201427,497255,2013/3/22,5,Love this recipe!!!  I&#039;m a potato pancake fanatic!!!  Delicious!
386585,503544,2013/9/24,4,"This was a really nice twist on everyday burgers.  I made this exactly as posted, and was rewarded with a tasty meal.  The only thing that I wasn&#039;t crazy about was the texture.  The breadcrumbs and the eggs made it seem more like meat loaf than burgers.  I think next time I would forgo both, and just add the seasonings to the ground beef.  I&#039;m sure it will be wonderful."
2423055,497255,2013/3/11,5,These sound so good and easy too. I know my family would enjoy them. nj
865936,503544,2016/8/9,4,The flavor of these burgers was delicious. I also didn't care for the texture with the breadcrumbs. The burger would be juicier (the way American's like) without them.
288146,520924,2017/3/12,5,"This was really good! The flavor on the chicken was a little lacking but that could have been my fault, next time I'll really amp up the spices. The brussel sprouts were deliciously caramelized and oh so good :) I'll definitely make this again, thanks for posting!"
1153541,520924,2017/5/27,5,"yum, I thought it was easy and perfect"
2814979,508950,2014/5/30,4,"I&#039;m going to have to tweak this a little, maybe too much beet flavor, but very creative.  Always looking for new pizza ideas, and this was definitely new.  Merged this with another similar recipe and thought I&#039;d share her method for those without a stone.  Prepare the pizza on a sheet of parchment paper, slide it with the paper onto your paddle, and then into the oven.  The paper blackened but didn&#039;t burn, and gave us a really nice crispy and chewy crust.  Any ideas on a different sauce?"
542159,503413,2013/8/18,5,"These make a great snack or simple healthy dessert that is very yummy! I made using whole natural almonds and some dates DH had brought home. The way I remember this from my childhood is with Medjool dates (I did not have) and blanched almonds. Served with Recipe #502696 very tasty pairing, thanks for the post."
37449,503413,2013/8/24,5,This was easy and very good! I actually ate 4-6 almonds for each date and loved it that way. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 for team Hot Stuff.
204024,502889,2013/7/27,5,"Eating the second of these messy wonders as I write. Combining Souvlaki flavors with the Gyro sandwich format is a great idea and makes good eating. We had a little trouble splitting the pita, but it works just as well to just wrap the pita around everything taco-style. Loved it. Made for ZWT 9."
107583,503868,2013/7/15,5,"Into my Best of 2013 book with this one.  I have a hard time finding skirt steak around here, so used a flank steak.  It turned out perfectly.  Great flavors and loved the BBQ sauce with lime brushed on at the end.  I put the spices on the meat and refrigerated for about 4 hours before cooking.  I used recipe #19160 for the cajun spices.  Made for ZWT 9."
865936,503868,2013/7/16,5,"This was really, really flavorful.  I am used to squirting fresh lime juice on my skirt steak since I like it Colombian-style, but the Creole seasoning really &quot;kicked it up a notch!&quot;"
227978,503868,2013/7/18,5,"This was delicious!  It had a unique Cajun flair, a little different than most Cajun recipes I&#039;ve tried (and I mean that in a good way).  And it&#039;s so easy to prepare, too.  I chose to broil my skirt steak, but I&#039;d like to try this on the grill on another day.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  We really liked your recipe, JackieOhNo!  Made for ZWT 9 (Cajun/Creole)."
461834,503868,2013/7/23,5,"Really a unique recipe which we enjoyed!!!  I too, made this using flank steak as my store didn&#039;t have skirt steak.  For the seasoning I used Emeril&#039;s Essence and followed the recipe as written.  Served it with baked potato, recipe#502798 and garlic bread for a delicious meal!!!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
1802484225,523551,2015/11/23,3,"Quick and fun meal. Everyone enjoyed it. The tomatoes and onions add a nice fresh, crispiness to the dish. However, the cheese sauce definitely needs to be doubled. I only made a few changes. I didn&#039;t cook the cooked chicken in the sauce. I made the sauce, then add the chicken. I left out the butter altogether, the sauce would have been greasy IMO. And I didn&#039;t use seasoning salt due to allergies."
634323,514175,2014/8/20,5,"Really enjoyed this recipe.  It&#039;s simple, but a nice change from the standard salad.  I have already made it twice for company and everyone liked it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have to admit I did take some liberties - I think the main thing is the dressing.  For that, I used the ingredients listed but just whisked them together and added the chopped up cilantro.  To make the prep even quicker, I bought pre-shredded cabbage and carrots from the grocery.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;."
131126,495328,2013/3/2,5,"I adapted the recipe to make in the crockpot, but the changes were technique rather than ingredients.  After browning the meat I added it to the crockpot and reduced the water by one cup to cook on low most of the day.  The end result was different and delicious! The complex flavors had depth. It reminded me of a fusion of greek spaghetti and mexican mole in the best way.  Next time though I will chop rather than mince the bell pepper and onion as I thought a  chunkier size would fit better with the beans. Good luck in the contest!"
114027,495328,2013/3/4,4,"Really loved the spice blend in there, they made it seem sweet without actually being too sweet! As SusieD already mentioned, I would make the onion and peppers a little larger, but if you have an onion hater in the house smaller might be better! Good Luck!"
1026228,495229,2013/3/21,0,"Haven&#039;t tried this yet, but it sounds nice. I will make it as a galette - stacking the pancakes one above the other with filling between each and the sauce poured over the top."
1808377,495358,2013/5/13,5,"My family saw this on Food Network over the weekend and we made this for dinner on Saturday night.  It was really good, we would totally make this again.  Also, the one thing that is missing from the original recipe is the addition of &quot;56 ounces ground tomatoes, such as Pastene Chunky Kitchen Ready&quot; to be added at the end of the sauce recipe."
107135,503356,2013/9/4,5,good simple zwt9
498271,494061,2013/10/24,5,Sometimes the simplest preparations are the best and this is one of those!  Couldn&#039;t be easier and absolutely delicious.  I reduced this to 2 servings and used a little extra parsley.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  Made for My3Chefs 2013
2000467171,494061,2015/9/11,5,"Thank you, just whipped this up for tonight dinner!"
2597942,507247,2013/12/21,5,"I made these for dinner tonight as a side with a pork tenderloin (well, I guess I can say I made these last night, since it&#039;s midnight now). I didn&#039;t change a single thing (other than the fact that I didn&#039;t use &quot;low-cal&quot; anything). Absolutely love garlic potatoes... and these fit the bill. Nice use of red new potatoes... quite rustic, super easy to make and very festive with the fresh parsley tossed in. Note: I did have to add a splash more of &quot;whole&quot; milk and just a tiny dollop of &quot;real butter&quot; to get the texture I was aiming for. (Sorry for no picture... I can&#039;t seem to post on here). Your yummy potatoes are in the running for our Christmas dinner. Thanks for posting.:"
37449,507247,2013/12/30,5,Easy and tasty! I used unsweetened almond milk and enjoyed my scaled down version. Thanks!
266635,501516,2014/9/9,5,"We really enjoyed this salad -- it is light enough to be a lunch salad and equally filling for dinner entree.  Loved all the ingredients; although DH pushed aside his carrots. : )  The dressing is wonderful and we loved the crunchy texture from all the veggies and peanuts.  Will definitely make this again.  Made for Culinary Quest, 2014 - China."
107135,507130,2014/8/27,5,"the anchovies make this a little browner and adds a nice taste with the garlic , very simple .cakepops on parade italian leg"
2001409656,501127,2017/2/27,0,Has anyone made this
2002288498,501127,2018/9/30,0,I'm Making this today.....
266635,512511,2014/2/14,5,"Incredibly delicious and sooo healthy for you!  I love chickpeas and of course, hummus -- but, this sandwich/salad creation is over the top.  I used tahini and the only thing I changed was the celery -- DH is just not a celery fan??  I did use canned chickpeas and just pulsed them in the food processor so they would still be a little chunky.  This recipe will be made often and I can&#039;t wait to share it with my BFF/next door neighbor - she is going to love it too!  Going right into my Best of 2014 Cookbook.  Made for PRMR, February, 2014."
1783373,512511,2014/5/2,5,"Very good...I love the crunch of the celery and walnuts along with the sweet of the dried cranberries.  Reminds me of a good chicken salad w/o the chicken.  Used the tahini and added a touch more of vinegar (I&#039;m a vinegar lover) along with the 2 T of water as suggested. Tastes even better when it&#039;s allowed to sit in the fridge.   Placed it in-between Tuscan whole wheat rustic bread, but I can see how it can also be served as a side to a main meal as well.  Thank you Sharon123 for sharing a healthy enjoyable sandwich."
1179225,512511,2014/5/27,5,"Delicious!! I didn&#039;t expect to like this as much as I did. I&#039;m not vegan so I used mayo for the dressing and only used about half the amount called for. I was uneasy after mixing up the dressing and tasting it. I didn&#039;t think the flavors would go well at all with the rest of the salad, but it was really great. I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and added some chopped Italian parsley. I let it sit in the fridge for a little over an hour before serving. Great as a sandwich and on its own. Thanks for sharing the keeper recipe!"
2908363,497097,2013/7/20,5,"I made this for the first time today, and it is DELICIOUS!!!  Being on a low carb diet is sometimes challenging, especially when you want something sweet.  This definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.  I will make it again, for sure!!"
131126,532656,2017/8/4,5,"This has been one of my favorite Culinary Quest 4 experiences! When I returned to post my review I found I made it completely wrong! Mistake #1: Instead of printing I jotted down the recipe. Mistake #2: I used baking mix to make biscuit dough. I added the cheese and cayenne, rolled the dough, and cut 8 biscuits. I then used the egg wash, sprinkled with nigella seeds and berbere seasoning. The biscuits rose beautifully and tasted sooooo good. The unexpected flavors were stellar in biscuits and the seeds and light sprinkle of berbere made them pretty too. If you like cheddar biscuits you would like these. I will use the recipe to make my adaptation of &quot;biscuits&quot; again. Thank you for the inspiration and I'll do better following the directions in the future."
280271,492956,2013/3/31,4,What a nice sauce to have on hand...I zested the citrus before boiling in the water...I found that holding the rind with tongs while you scrape out the pulp worked great...really liked the tart/sweet tang this gave...served it with recipe #492959 for a delicious meal...made for Spring PAC 2013 =)
2002314431,507763,2018/10/28,5,"So delicious, used bourbon"
2717992,496326,2013/3/2,5,Was looking for something kind of quick and easy and saw this as something I used to have as a kid except potatoes are used.  Simply Potatoes made this an easy recipe to use and the recipe itself made for great tasting sausage.  It was much like pigs in a blanket but with a twist which made it different from the sale ole pigs in a blanket.  Make sure you try this recipe!!
2718232,496326,2013/3/2,5,These are wonderfull. I have kids who love eating these for breakfast. I love eating these as my midnight snack. A must try!!!!!
178427,495314,2013/3/2,5,Another great sauce for ribs! All the flavors blended nicely together and it was a snap to make. I used it as a mop sauce on grilled baby back ribs. Thanks for sharing and Good Luck in the contest.
169430,500497,2013/6/19,4,I found this recipe intriguing and just had to try it. I must say that I was quite leery of the garlic but went ahead with it. I can see why it was there after tasting and I enjoyed the dish. This is something unique and quite pleasant. Made for North Africa/Middle East forum&#039;s &quot;A Month in Arabia&quot;
163112,500497,2013/6/27,5,Different &amp; exciting!  The Picky One didn&#039;t like it but I didn&#039;t expect she would.  Everyone else was pleasantly surprised how much they liked it!  Hooray!!  Made for Go to Saudi Arabia in the NA/ME Forum 6/13.
2324285,500497,2013/10/7,4,"Very interesting flavors in this dish, but I don&#039;t think they work for me.  The garlic was a bit overpowering- I&#039;d leave it out if I make this again.  It was a very unique side dish though and worth trying."
137302,496567,2013/3/25,5,"A really wonderful tasty perfect loaf of bread.  I didn&#039;t braid this one because I just wanted a regular shaped loaf of bread.  Next time I make this bread, and I will definitely make it again...I will braid and glaze it to show off it&#039;s beauty.  It really doesn&#039;t matter how you shape it, this makes beautiful and wonderfully good bread.  Made for PAC Spring 2013."
461834,493294,2013/1/16,5,"Fantastic!!!  I really loved these cinnamon twists especially since they are so easy and quick to make in the morning.  I made 1/2 of the recipe and ate two of them along with some fresh fruit for a breakfast.  The outside is kind of crispy, from the sugar and butter, and then the inside is soft and tender.  I sprinkled chopped pecans as my choice of nuts.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe and one I will make often.  Made for your win in the football pool, congrats on your win again!!!"
242766,493294,2013/1/26,5,"We loved these yummy, little cinnamon twists.  They go together quickly, with very little effort, using ingredients that I always have on hand.  We really liked that they were not overly sweet like so many other breakfast pastries.  I used chopped almonds, which toasted nicely while baking.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.<br/>**Made for 2012 Football Pool Divisional Playoffs**"
526666,493294,2013/3/14,5,"Love it! Monkey bread twists! I have to say that my rolling and twisting skills are in need of some work, but the taste is great, no matter my shortcomings...Thanks for sharing a winner, Maryland Jim and congratulations on &#039;both&#039; of your Super Bowl wins! ;-)"
194993,499146,2013/5/20,3,"Ok, I chose this recipe because it&#039;s low carb and super easy. It would have been helpful to have more specific measurements of some of the ingredients, although this is the kind of low-brow food that one can play around with. I found that the envelope of (hot) chili seasoning was not enough to flavor the entire dish, so I added some taco seasoning as well. It really could have used more seasoning overall. I used about 5 hot dogs and about 1 cup of cheese, and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce. It would probably work to sub salsa for the tomato sauce. &lt;br/&gt;My family seemed to like it. One son made &quot;chili dog sloppy joes&quot; by putting the mixture on a roll. I added mustard to my portion. I had it ready to go into the oven in a matter of minutes, always a plus at the end of a workday."
2000324815,501743,2015/7/8,3,"Would&#039;ve been perfect but feta is very salty, too much so for two cups, I&#039;m making it again using 1 cup feta and 1 cup cream cheese and not adding additional salt either. Also I didn&#039;t butter the top sheet last time and it just curled and crinkled under the heat, it has to be buttered so I&#039;m watching it as it gets close to the end this time"
2001444656,501743,2017/3/19,0,"Guys, we use yogurt, not regular milk. Mix cheese, yogurt and eggs, you don't need to add salt."
2001549128,501743,2017/5/22,0,"this has to be a joke? milk? no thank you, use greek yogurt instead if you have to, but usually it is made without that either and you eat it with the yogurt after it is out of the oven"
11673203,501743,2017/10/26,5,"Fantastic! I made it my own by adding spinach and used white Bulgarian cheese instead of feta to mine. I also added in some cayenne pepper for a little kick and used Greek yogurt in place of the milk. Mine baked for 50 minutes @ 350F and was moist and flavorful. Just before I put it in the oven, I sliced through the first few layers to make it easier to cut when it was finished, (my Bulgarian friend taught me that) then brushed the top with egg and half and half and sprinkled it with sesame seeds. Delicious!"
2855524,501743,2018/11/27,5,"Added this to our Thanksgiving menu since we had a Bulgarian guest. After reading reviews decided to use Greek yogurt mixed with some milk, mostly feta cheese and bit of goat cheese, no salt. Our guest said it was very good, and everyone in the family liked it (a rarity at our house). Will make this again for sure."
1620171,501804,2013/11/23,5,"This was lovely. I only had little eggplants, so I roasted a bit too long and they dried up, so I added a little carrot to make it go further. The spices were really nice and I had big chunks of garlic in mine that packed a punch. Made for My Food Odyssey."
179133,501804,2013/11/25,5,This is very tasty. I wasn&#039;t sure how big of eggplants to use so used three medium to small sized globe eggplants. Cut back on the cayenne just a bit but otherwise used amounts called for. Thanks for sharing!
1436160,512333,2014/4/17,4,"I made these on the stove top to use in Recipe #512335. I had to buck the directions and soaked the beans overnight.  I&#039;ve had issues with not soaking beans and did not want to risk it. I used 6 cups of water when cooking the beans instead of 8 since it seemed to be plenty. I waited to add the salt until the beans were soft. After the beans had cooked and cooled I added the ingredients under the Add When Reheating section, except substituting red wine vinegar for balsamic vinegar due to personal preference. I waffled on whether I should add them or not, but I thought if I didn&#039;t add them the beans would have less flavor.  These beans were very well in Recipe #512335 and have the left overs frozen for later use.  Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014."
452355,503664,2013/7/18,3,"I thought these sweet potatoes held great promise.  They were extremely easy to prepare, which made for a hassle-free side dish to shrimp po boys.  The spices used were ones I typically had on hand.  DH, myself, and my dinner guest, however, didn&#039;t overly care for the combination of flavors once prepared.  Made for ZWT9."
65502,503664,2013/7/18,5,I loved this potato! The spice mixture was great and the recipe is super easy. I have to admit that I put about 1/2 teaspoon of butter on each half when they were done. They went great with Recipe #503663 and Recipe #503410. Made for my fellow Tasty Tester for ZWT9. Thanks EK! :)
447487,503664,2013/7/27,4,"What a lovely way to jazz up a sweet potato ! Definitely some heat here (though I may tend to be liberal with the cayenne). DH &amp; I really enjoyed this. With some ground lamb it made a delicious work lunch for me and just on it&#039;s own for a quick lunch at home. Sorry I forgot to take a picture, I&#039;ll be making this again and will then for sure. Thanks so much for posting, EK ! Made during ZWT#9 for my team, Tasty Testers :)"
679953,499962,2013/5/18,5,"This was a nice simple recipe with great results.   For this, I did not change a thing,  great side dish, and very inexpensive.  The garlic added great flavors to the tomatoes.  made a great side dish.  Served with recipe#468808#468808, for a nice simple, but satisfying dinner.  Made for PRMR tag."
482933,499962,2014/1/14,4,"Great recipe, sooo flavorful! I cut tomatoes in quarters and cut fennel in chunks, had in one hour and tomatoes were done but not the fennel. Next time I would reduce oil quite a bit. Served with recipe#456308."
486725,499962,2016/12/24,5,"You're right, the tomatoes do really intensify in flavor. They are so delicious that way, and I loved the fennel too. Only change I had to make is to roast them without the garlic. This does serve a ton, but that's OK with us - the rest can be enjoyed as leftovers, with pasta, on a sandwich, etc."
1056692,523246,2016/8/6,5,"I left out the extracts and cinnamon so that I could use this as a corn syrup substitute in an Asian zing wing recipe I found. This is thickening up very well as I write this and I can't wait to add the spices and toss this with some wings. I used confectioner's style Swerve and didn't have to grind anything. Thanks for sharing! I was having a heck of a time finding a sugar free sub for plain corn syrup. I'm sure this would be great as written on some low carb pancakes as well, so I'll be making it again. I did only add about 1/4 cup of water to this to keep it thick, so add a bit at a time until it's the consistency you want."
2001485142,530128,2017/4/12,5,"as described! quick, easy and more tasty than it sounds. grill fresh chicken breast instead of canned chicken if you have the time, but I have tried it both ways and it's all good. thank you for sharing!"
80353,503942,2013/7/20,5,"Absolutely gorgeous dessert!  I must say that this time of year, we probably have access to the world&#039;s most delicious peaches, and I did want to try this recipe.  It is so easy to put together and so pretty on the plate, served with a dollop of thick greek yoghurt.  The almondy filling is lovely with the flower waters perfuming the whole.  Really a great dessert of the area (not just Greece)."
1706426,503942,2013/7/25,5,What a great dessert! Thank you so much for posting it The filling was a perfect compliment to the peaces Made for ZWT9
107135,502787,2013/7/20,5,fast easy hot loved this try this zwt9
2597942,499984,2013/5/11,5,"We loved the steaks. I made them according to instructions, and cooked them directly on the grill (our gas stove/oven is being repaired). I used the Grill Mates and other seasonings, but only added a pinch of ground thyme (I did not have the leaves). While hubby was grilling (about 2 minutes per side), I was using my electric griddle to grill some sliced onions with EVOO and toasted up some split french rolls. Our steaks were quite thin, so I put two on each roll. We made rib-eye sandwiches out of the steaks, and they were fantastic!. I also made some homemade chips to go with them. Thank you for an excellent dinner tonight. (Made for &quot;Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup&quot; tag)."
157167,503649,2013/8/28,5,"Not quite what I was expecting, but a lovely lemony feta dip.  I used half of the recipe on Recipe #72922 and it was simply amazing, I think I liked it even better than just as a dip.  I was somehow out of dried basil, so I used fresh from my garden.  For ZWT9 Zingo"
80353,503649,2013/8/28,5,"Made a 1/2 recipe of this and also added a healthy pinch of dried oregano.  We ate it all up, in front of the telly, with pita crisps.  Really delicious."
895132,503649,2013/8/30,5,"Yum! I made a half batch and we had it with carrot sticks and bell peppers. Awesome dip for raw veggies, will also try it on chicken like Random Rachel suggested. Thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Zingo for The Apron String Travelers"
480195,503649,2013/9/4,5,"It&#039;s been so hot here that I used this for a cold pasta salad. I used 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, added in 2 garlic cloves and mixed it with 1 lb penne. I added 1/2 c pasta water to loosen it up a little more. I garnished the pasta salad with halved cherry tomatoes and sliced black olives. It was great. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
128473,503649,2013/11/17,5,"I enjoyed this lovely dish for lunch today.  Served the delicious dip with nana bread.  Yumm so much flavor, quick and very easy to make, with terrific results.  Loved the flavors in the feta, the salt, lemon, basil and olive oil, so very tasty.  Made in Memory of Pammyowl."
157167,503510,2013/7/14,4,"This had a great flavor!  It took a little longer both for the butter to melt, and for the egg whites to set.  I had impatient hungry people waiting so I just microwaved it for a minute at the end.  Perfect weekend breakfast with toast and fruit. For ZWT9."
2735295,497176,2013/3/13,5,Tastes great!
2739729,497176,2013/3/16,5,Easy to make.  Can not believe it cuts and taste like a regular pizza. Each slice folds like a regular pizza.  I first read this and thought I would need a spoon but I was surprise this is exactly like what I order from a pizza joint.  MUST TRY THIS..
707200,506090,2017/10/6,5,"Super-flavorful, super-easy recipe! I highly recommend it!"
169430,503510,2013/7/23,5,Yummy. I only made 1 serving for my breakfast so used my little cast iron skillet to make this and the dish came out wonderfully. It worked perfectly under the broiler. I just tipped it out onto a slice of toast and had a great hot start to this rainy day. Thanks for a different way to do eggs. Made for ZWT 9.
461834,507760,2015/1/8,5,"These are so delicious!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe and made them into muffins, as I am usually the only one that eats this type of food.  I had one with some eggs today for brunch and then froze the rest, which I will pull out and reheat for breakfast with maybe a smear of cream cheese in the mornings.  I will definitely make these again, but would almost mince the apples, so I get some in every bite and then would sprinkle the top with the pecans and then just use a shaker of cinnamon/sugar to put a light coating on top, as this was a bit much for me as a topping.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!!  Made for &quot;For your Consideration Tag Game&quot;."
2000498330,507760,2016/7/15,5,Delicious warm right out of the oven. Loaded with apples and lovely spiced flavor/smell.
2001399209,507282,2017/2/20,5,Excellent..... I just added a tbsp of Thai fish sauce
163112,503317,2013/9/6,5,"I&#039;m a wee confuzzled because the title says coconut cream but the ingredients/directions say coconut milk.  I used coconut cream (is this different from cream of coconut?)  and omitted the added sugar.  Absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe for a quick afternoon snack.  Made for ZWT9 Family Picks, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
2689184,496524,2013/3/7,5,So simple and perfect for brunch!  Delicious!
2001236401,504015,2017/8/11,0,Why are there 2 dough recipes? I am confused.
1783373,516009,2014/5/25,5,"Oh Happy Day!!!  These came out soooo good.  I used spareribs which is a tender cut and roasting them on low temp guaranteed them to come out super moist.  I used rosie316&#039;s  &quot;Recipe #510906&quot;  and boy was it good. I used more than the suggested 3 tablespoons, as I found that it needed more to cover surface of meat.  Tasted it when it came out of the oven and it was good even without the barbecue sauce.  I baked it for 4 hours by accident (meant to let it bake for 3), but I was out weeding the garden to prep it for planting and didn&#039;t realize that 3 hours had passed.  No fear though as the 4 hours was perfect.  I used &quot;Recipe #368461&quot; and the end result was FANTABULOUS.  My husband who has never really been a big fan of ribs had 2 helpings.  Thank you rosie316 for converting my hubby to liking ribs and thanks for sharing your recipe.  Tagged it for PRMR."
204024,516009,2014/5/27,5,Really tender delicious ribs.  I used your recipe for a rub minus spicy stuff.  Made for our Memorial day dinner.
1803438968,516009,2014/11/30,5,"I had never made ribs before, but tried these last week. Used a general spice rub, and Jim Beam Smoked Hickory &amp; Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. Didn&#039;t really measure out the rub, just sprinkled it on both sides of the ribs. They tasted amazing! Am making them again tonight, and think ribs must be my new favourite meal!"
348596,516009,2014/12/18,0,"This turned out well, but with some modifications. I used a roasting pan with the lid (no foil) with about 3.3lbs of side ribs. The total cook time was about 2 hours and 20 mins."
171084,516009,2015/1/18,5,"Rosie you did good girl!!!  These ribs hit the spot! Meat was falling off the bone - so very tender and yet still juicy.  I elected to NOT sauce mine, hubby did his.  Either way these are the bomb! The instructions were nice and clear, easy to follow.  Next time we don&#039;t want to brave Mother Nature, I now know how to get our rib fix!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
7093,516009,2015/2/6,5,"These turned out great!!! I used Damaris Phillips&#039; (Food Network) Spice Rub and I also spread the meat with mustard before rubbing to help it stick. The ribs were awesome, so tender!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!"
2000049308,516009,2015/3/8,5,"13yo  daughter found this and followed all directions -- super ez and I  love the bulk
rub and sauce.  Devoured by all kids and hubby.  I will never grill/burn/ruin ribs on grill again.  Thank you so much!!"
2000122861,516009,2015/4/7,5,"Made these ribs yesterday for the first time and they were FABULOUS!  I used a barbecue spice rub from Penzey on the ribs, and added some Stubbs Sauce at the end.  They were fall off the bone tender, juicy, so delicious, just wish there would have been more.  My whole family loved them.  I can&#039;t wait to go to the farmers market and buy some more ribs to make this again!  Thanks for such a wonderful, easy recipe!"
2000184463,516009,2015/5/4,5,I have used this recipe twice so far and I have a 3rd batch that I just put in the oven about 5 minutes ago. The first bit of trouble I noticed about this recipe is that it uses portions as pounds of meat. Well if your like me then you know that when you make ribs EACH rack can easily be 4 pounds on its own. So a good rule of thumb is 2 tablespoons of rub on the meaty side and half a tablespoon on the bony side and then for the BBQ sauce its really to taste instead of an exact measure. I also use a rub and BBQ sauce that can be bought at any wal mart and it makes these SO perfect. I use McCormick Grill Mates Sweet &amp; Smoky Rub and Sonny&#039;s Sweet BBQ Sauce.
2000215188,516009,2015/5/20,5,You have just given me a great reason to give up dieting. Best ribs ever. Thanks.
2000287017,516009,2015/6/22,5,"Just tried this tonight. I didn&#039;t do the rub, as I generally don&#039;t for ribs, but I did slather on the BBQ for the last 30 minutes in the oven. Oh. My. GOD. These are SO good! The meat just fell off the bone and they were delicious! I will definitely be doing this again!"
2000305782,516009,2015/6/30,5,"Used this recipe for cooking my pork ribs and they were outstanding !!
Thanks so much for such great directions !!!!"
2000606436,516009,2015/10/25,0,"I followed this recipe, and will go back to my original method, of slow simmering, for 4 hours, or until tender, then bake for an additional hour with my favorite sauce. It was too tough."
2001080743,516009,2016/7/8,5,This is a great recipe. The ribs were very tender and not fatty since you pour that off before putting the barbecue sauce on. And it was really easy to make!
2001091810,516009,2016/7/17,5,"I just want to say that I CANNOT cook (I can burn water), and I tried this recipe last night, and it was amazing! If I can do this, anyone can. Thanks for making this recipe so easy to follow."
2001181340,516009,2016/9/24,3,"I baked 2 racks at once and after 6 1/2 hours, they still weren't ready. I think this is a good recipe, but would increase the temperature to at least 325."
1060667,516009,2016/11/30,4,"These were good, but I think they either need to go longer, or bump up the temp. Mine were not fall off the bone, but still a decent tenderness."
2001341128,516009,2017/4/4,5,I made them your way...temperature worked beautifully! Best ribs ever! TY
2001502386,516009,2017/4/22,5,I did it for 3 hours oven 300&deg;f. Meat was so tender it came completely right of the bone. Used sweet &amp; spicy bbq sauce. Delicious Great recipe thanks
2001558508,516009,2017/5/28,0,"&quot;If using individual Country Style (St. Louis), lay on their side.&quot; Curious, how does one lay ribs on their side?"
2001982458,516009,2018/2/9,0,What seasoning did yu was for the ribs
2002005174,516009,2018/2/22,4,"A lot of real Southerners (that's not Texans, BTW) eat their ribs with just salt and pepper and sloooow cook their pork. Gave you four stars for most everything, but left one off for not even mentioning the possibility of just eating the meat, not fancy rubs and sauces. Yeah, pork is that tasty when it's sloooow cooked. (P.S. You have to be a Southerner to say that word, &quot;sloooow&quot; properly. c:)"
2002006882,516009,2018/2/22,0,I have used this recipe once and I swear to it they were the best ribs I've ever tasted in my life Now here I go again for the second time except this time I'm going to take photos and I cannot wait to eat these ribs that fall off the bone
2002143332,516009,2018/5/6,0,great recipe thanks.
1436160,503365,2014/5/6,4,This was a yummy salad however I failed to notice that there were no strawberries in the ingredient list. We really enjoyed the honey mustard dressing. I also subbed walnuts for the pecans because of personal preference. Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
798070,504353,2014/7/26,5,"Really good recipe!  Made it pretty much as written except omitted the egg wash, and it was just what I was looking for. Very easy to make. Thanks for posting the recipe."
2001052901,504353,2016/12/6,5,"Good recipe and turned out quite well. Followed it mostly, though I subbed half the flour with ap flour. I did use instant yeast, as I was short on time. However, next time I'll probably omit. Will come back next time I make these and let others know how the naturally leavened dough does. Anyway, Thank you for the recipe!"

1546189,498738,2014/1/5,5,"Loved the taste and texture of this cornbread!  Instead of making muffins or a loaf, I used it as a topping for a chili bake.    I halved the recipe, and dropped spoonfuls of it on top of my chili in a 8&quot; round casserole dish - my chili&#039;s a thick and chunky version, so the cornbread baked up very nicely on top.  Baked for 40 minutes, until it was nicely browned.  Even my husband, who is not a big cornbread fan, raved about the cornbread topping and went back for seconds.  This is definitely a keeper!!  And nobody would ever suspect it&#039;s gluten-free ;)"
156010,498738,2015/5/26,5,"Wow.  These were fantastic -- thank you very much!  I&#039;ve been searching for recipes for my son - he&#039;s on an &quot;8-food exclusion diet&quot; for allergies (no wheat, eggs, soy, dairy, fish, shellfish, peanuts, or tree nuts), and this worked beautifully.  I used an egg replacement product, oat milk + 1 Tbsp of vinegar, and vegan butter -- and these had a great light texture and were so good (unlike many of the dense gluten-free muffins we&#039;ve tried so far).  For others out there thinking about trying these, I found them very sweet (the author commented on that), and almost halved the sugar --they were still sweeter than most boxed corn muffin mixes, but still delicious.  I also worried that I&#039;d messed up the recipe because the batter was very thin and pourable, but they came out fine.  Thanks again!"
2000229284,498738,2015/5/26,4,I used Bob Red Mill All Purpose gluten free flour and mistakenly used baking powder instead of baking. I used coconut milk with some lemon juice since I didn&#039;t have butter milk. Mine didn&#039;t rise like most corn bread does. The flour has xanthum in it. It does taste good! Wonder if it was my mistake with the baking powder?
1022551,498738,2015/6/5,5,"These were delicious!  I used the GF flour mix from America&#039;s Test Kitchen cookbook.  I wish there wasn&#039;t so much sugar and butter but next time I will work on reducing that a bit.  But, really delicious muffins that are kid approved!"
2000787712,498738,2015/12/30,5,These were great!  I used 1/2 a cup of sugar but otherwise followed the recipe exactly (including the xanthum).
2000977547,498738,2016/4/18,5,"Oh my, these were the BEST cornbread muffins I&#039;ve ever had, gluten-free or no! Moist, fluffy, toothsome, with a beautiful crumb and high rise. I&#039;m sure the recipe as written would be perfect, but I made a few alterations to suit our meal. I reduced the sugar to a scant 2/3 c., added a 7 oz can of diced green chilies (well drained), and 3 oz grated sharp cheddar. I&#039;ll be making these again and again. Thank you for the excellent recipe!"
2001487104,498738,2017/4/13,5,Thank you so much for these muffins. I had stopped eating my favorite corn muffins and now I can enjoy them again. Great recipe!
2001614686,498738,2017/7/6,0,I made these as mini muffins - baked at 350 in my convection oven for 15 minutes. They are terrific and I like them as bite sized companions to share
2001963471,498738,2018/1/30,5,I made these as regular muffins for 18 minutes at 350 degrees in a convection oven. These are delicious! My new favorite!
2002025629,498738,2018/3/2,0,Has anyone substituted honey for the sugar?
2002045230,498738,2018/3/11,0,Pour? Where does &quot;pouring&quot; come in? this is not liquid. It's like cookie batter...
2002176696,498738,2018/6/5,0,"It says POUR into skillet, scoop into muffin pan."
2002336974,498738,2018/11/18,5,I brought these to a Thanksgiving dinner last night and they were a big hit. Simple to make and delicious!
2002356511,498738,2018/12/4,5,"I love these corn muffins. I've been making them for years and they are amazing. Here are my tweaks to make them a little more healthy: I use 6oz of butter instead of 8oz (we don't seem to notice the difference), and 5 T of honey instead of sugar."
191533,494469,2013/4/11,4,"I enjoyed this recipe for our dinner tonight. Made some changes due to what I had on hand. Cut the recipe in half and used 2 8oz. chicken breasts. (3 hours on low in 3qt. crockpot) The rub is amazing! I used Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s sauce because I didn&#039;t have time to make my own.&lt;br/&gt;The &#039;salad&#039; is just a mixed vegetable side dish, didn&#039;t have much flavor unless we added more bbq sauce. I did steam the carrots with the limas; next time will steam the carrots first to get them more tender. Hubby liked the crunchy celery in it!"
2324285,494469,2013/10/20,5,"The best BBQ that I&#039;ve made without a grill!  I used 8 chicken thighs instead of 4 turkey thighs, and they were fall-off-the-bone tender.  The sauce was wonderful, although I added sriracha sauce for spiciness and smokiness.  The salad came out somewhat bland, but was really perked up with some adobo seasoning.  Very good meal overall."
1052873,494469,2013/12/5,4,"5 stars for the meat and barbecue sauce, 3 stars for the salad. Used our homegrown meat. Fall off the bone tender after 4  hours on low. Made for Rookie Recipe Tag Fall 2013."
895132,493139,2013/2/25,5,"This was utterly yummy!! I made it with walnuts and pecorino cheese and loved every bite of it. It has a distinct kale flavour which goes very well with the walnuts. We had this with gluten free pasta. It's definitely a very interesting change of the usual pesto, and a great alternative for winter. Thanks for posting!<br/>Made for Healthy Choices Tag Game."
542159,493139,2013/5/26,4,Really liked the balance and health benefits of this pesto! I made using the walnut option and really enjoyed that the kale was not an overpowering factor/flavor. Recommend using good quality ingredients as each and every flavor in this recipe shines through. Thanks for the post.
37449,493139,2013/11/11,5,Much enjoyed with some whole wheat orzo.  Made in honor of Pammy for her cookathon.
133174,493139,2013/11/16,5,Really enjoyed the recipe.  Another delicious way to serve nutrient packed kale.  I used the pine nut option and may have been a little over zealous when getting the water off the blanched kale.  My pesto was very thick and needed thinning.  Next time around I will not be so eager to get the water out.  This was made in memory of pammyowl.
323186,493139,2013/11/25,5,"Good for us and delicious too, I used pinenuts for a very tasty pesto.  So very simple to prepare,  I loved this recipe.  Thank you, made in loving memory of Pammyowl,  rest in peace, dear friend."
1802657586,501918,2014/4/10,5,"Love this!  So good and easy!  It took a significantly longer time for the garlic to be soft (20 additional minutes), but easy fix!"
226863,493178,2013/6/23,4,"This recipe is surprising....not just chicken and rice.  With the dijon and hot sauce, you get some heat.  But with the honey, you get sweetness.  It is quick and easy to make if you have already cooked chicken, which I would recommend that you increase a bit.  A very different chicken and rice dish, that is very easy to make.  I enjoyed it, but not sure that I&#039;d make it again.  But do try it, the flavors may just be perfect for you!  Thanks for sharing. Made for Photo Tag game."
37779,493178,2014/8/30,4,This comes together very fast. I used rotisserie chicken. Doubled the hot sauce and added 1 tsp salt. Very filling and perfect for a busy weeknight. Thanks Booms.
633361,500133,2013/9/1,5,"Very easy to make, and a fantastic and different way to cook broccoli.&lt;br/&gt;We loved it here served with our roast.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Miss Fannie."
280271,495400,2014/4/9,4,The family enjoyed these while saying how dry they were...unfortunately they were not moist at all...the flavor was good...in fact everyone committed on the touch of cinnamon...the only change I made was to use light brown sugar instead of dark...made for Spring 2014 PAC...=)
2585084,499429,2013/5/14,5,This marinade made the drumsticks tender and succulent.  My family enjoyed them for dinner.  I will be sure to use this recipe again.  Thank you for posting it.
339260,499429,2013/6/22,5,"Very tasty chicken recipe.  I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of drumsticks.  I loved the combination of honey, cilantro and lime.  I used a sugar-free honey substitute.  The chicken was juicy and very flavorful.  I will be using this marinade often this summer.  Made for June 2013 Aus/NZ Swap."
39835,499429,2013/7/13,4,Very good chicken which we all enjoyed with corn-on-the-cob and sliced tomatoes. Thanks for sharing!
280271,499429,2013/9/30,4,I used the recipe to make chicken wings and broiled them in the oven...I thought these were very good but hubby loved them...he really enjoyed the cilantro and lime taste...I barely could taste the ingredients....made them for one of our appy nights...thanks for posting it...=)
219942,505602,2013/8/22,4,"Interesting salad, reminiscent of a carrot salad my grams used to always make. She put raisins in hers. DH&#039;s mom used to make it, too. I&#039;m not a carrot salad fan, but hubby is! I never even knew that until I served this tonight! So I told him I&#039;d make it for him anytime. If you&#039;re a carrot fan, you will like this salad, it&#039;s sweet and very pretty, too. The orange flower water gives it even more depth of flavor. ZWT9"
285039,508449,2014/3/14,5,"So delicious and perfect for a Lenten meal!  I doubled this recipe, using one full can of Cento tomato paste, and Cento San Marzano tomatoes.  I typically use the best tomatoes I can find when preparing a dish such as this which features tomato.   I did decrease the olive oil by 1/4, and also used 2 t. of red pepper flake and passed it at the table for those that wanted to spice it up.  I loved the fresh tomato flavor of this sauce and will definitely make it again!"
174096,508449,2014/8/19,5,"Quick and easy! This has a great flavor. The tomato was very pronounced, and there was a nice kick to it. Thanks for sharing! Culinary Quest &#039;14"
128473,508449,2014/8/28,5,"Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe kate.  It was quick and very easy, using ingredients that I always have on hand, but best of all it tasted great and the picky dh loved it.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014 for the Suitcase Gourmets."
80353,508449,2014/9/13,5,This is a great pantry supper to put together with things that are always in my cupboard.  Good eating.
226863,513654,2014/3/12,5,"Had to work 8 to 7 today and wanted something good for dinner that didn&#039;t take too long.  This fit the bill perfectly and was delicious.  The only think I might change next time is to grill the shrimp instead of sauteing. I picked the shrimp up on my lunch break, so it was nice and fresh.  It really did taste like a margarita! Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game."
1052873,503065,2013/8/4,5,Awesome. I had to make it as chunks rather than wedges to fit into the pan. The lime was perfect with the sweetness of the pineapple and the cinnamon creme fraiche was the perfect accompaniment. Made for ZWT9.
315565,503065,2013/8/27,4,This was sweet enough without adding the creme fraiche. Great dessert and interesting way to serve pineapple. I used a lime from my tree. Made for Family Picks.
2741813,494789,2013/3/17,5,I make this without the shrimp.  It&#039;s AWESOME.  I prefer my fish a little over cooked so I generally cook 20/20 minutes.
1800075365,494789,2013/9/24,5,so delicious!!!
679953,500231,2013/5/25,5,"For this, I left out the 2 options, powdered sugar, and the lemon and lime peel, and used coconut cream, which added alot of flavor we thought.  All in all a very nice mid-morning treat that we enjoyed.  Very chewy, as the texture was wonderful.  Made for PRMR tag."
204024,492848,2013/4/10,4,Flavorful topping for our Salmon tonight.   Made for PAC Spring 2013.
2370454,501353,2013/6/9,1,This is nothing like a Wendy&#039;s Frosty. Don&#039;t waist your time or the ingredients.
2001116310,501353,2016/8/5,4,"Very enjoyable but I used about a half of a Frozen banana, sliced. The banana needs to be frozen to get a thicker consistency....will make again!"
482376,493738,2013/3/24,5,"This is a great way to cook green beans. We loved the result of roasting. I halved the garlic powder and paprika and still thought it was plenty. Next time, I might even skip those two ingredients and just use the olive oil, salt and pepper and then the parmesan cheese. Thanks for posting a great recipe! Made for Spring 2013 PAC."
674022,493738,2013/4/14,5,"I found this recipe on skinnytaste.com from 2011 and was glad it was posted here already. Thanks for posting Alan. Made as written except we omitted the paprika as personal preference.We loved this oven roasting. It doesn&#039;t use a burner and the texture is great. The shrinking and wrinkling of the beans and the brown spots from carmelizing were a put off to the kids but we loved them all. They are so good for you, weight watcher friendly and tasty. Gone in a flash. Enjoy! ChefDLH"
12609008,493738,2014/9/9,4,"Made this for the first time and found it to be an excallant way to make green beans, I did everything the recipe said but substituted Smoked Paprika and also cover my beans the first 15 minutes with foil and then took the foil off and finished them roasting just to get my beans cooked  more."
239758,497895,2013/4/29,5,"This is one of those recipes that, as I made it, I kept wondering &#039;will it work?&#039;. A tablespoon of flour and a cup of sugar are not my normal proportions. But these were so easy to make and so yummy. Nice thin wafers with a great crunch. I got only 24 cookies (probably used too much batter per cookies) and they spread AND spread AND spread. I should have had a couple of kids here guessing what shapes we&#039;d get. Thanks Miss Fannie for sharing this heirloom recipe."
724631,511252,2014/1/17,3,"Apologies... My Cocoa Bombs came out dry, and I was not able to figure out how to save them.  I tried increasing the cooking time, but that did not solve my problem.  If you can figure where I went wrong, I would be happy to try this recipe again.  This is up my alley (wedding cookies).  Made for Photo Tag."
679953,511252,2014/2/16,4,"Not as dry as I had thought,  I did use 5 tablespoons water, gradually adding 1 tablespoon as I was mixing, and in step 1 I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of butter, it seemed to be more consistent.  All gobbled up, and made for  nice treat.  Made for PRMR Tag."
724631,496265,2013/12/14,5,"Slightly nutty flavor, I like the currants (they are smaller than raisins, so there are lots more pockets of raisin-y accent).  This combination of flours yields a depth of flavor, fully released when toasted slightly and lightly buttered.  Pumpernickel flour is available through King Arthur Flour. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag game."
80353,503057,2013/7/16,4,"A very good, base recipe.  I did add in a tablespoonful each of tahini and greek yoghurt because I nearly always do. ;-)"
2735324,497409,2013/3/13,0,I will be trying this recipe next!!!
306726,497409,2013/3/16,5,Great photo of some tasty pork chops!
2430064,497409,2013/3/22,5,Simply easy and love your combination of ingredients!
914360,497409,2013/3/22,0,Wow !  great recipe !
2201427,497409,2013/3/22,5,Wonderful recipe!  The potato/brussel sprout filling in the pork chop is an awesome combination of flavors!!
2737834,497409,2013/3/23,5,"I hope to try this recipe soon.  Mmmm, brussels sprouts, bacon and potato."
2189849,497409,2013/3/24,5,"Oh my goodness, this dish was so delicious ~ so easy and tasty!"
2779078,497409,2013/4/10,0,I know what is for dinner tomorrow night!  Thank you Tresa!
2235640,497409,2013/4/23,5,"No one was more surprised than me by how much I loved this dish. I normally and not much of a brussel sprouts fan but the addition of the pepper bacon added so much great flavor. Such an easy dish (especially since the Simply Potatoes make it so I don&#039;t have to shred my potatoes, a much dreaded task)! This would be great just as a side dish without the chops, too. Well done!"
1869824,497409,2013/5/7,5,"Made this last night - delicious!!!  Made it as directed/written except used more bacon than it called for (what can I say, we like bacon lol).  Husband and father in law loved it too!  I think next time I&#039;ll just try and get chops that are a little thicker, the thinner ones were harder to cut into and make a pocket.  I wish I would have taken a picture, maybe next time!  There will be a next time!!! Very, very good recipe."
2001663011,497409,2018/4/12,0,I'm gonna try it with bacon and brussel sprouts and nix the potatoes. I got 2&quot; chops at Sam's Club.
2735324,497443,2013/3/13,5,I made these last night along with your chicken breast recipe you have posted and they were phenomenal! Very Yummy!!!
2201427,497443,2013/3/22,5,Great recipe .... awesome combination of just 5 ingredients!!
498271,498971,2013/6/28,5,"Absolutely delicious!  I used the pineapple juice and the pork was sweet and spicy and fantastic.  Served with flour tortillas, salsa, sour cream and lettuce and enjoyed a wonderful flavorful meal - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
169430,512680,2014/4/22,4,"We loved this sandwich. DH would have preferred his open face on regular bread but he ate it all. I skipped the poppy seed as he doesn&#039;t like anything &quot;gritty&quot;. I used the remains of last Sat&#039;s roast that was oh so tender and served it with fries and a salad. We enjoyed these. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
1802732913,512680,2014/8/31,5,"I&#039;ve made this twice now for beach gatherings this summer. In Pioneer Woman&#039;s original recipe she uses small dinner rolls but I used full size hamburger buns. I purchased evening from Smart and Final, I used their store brand roast beef and provolone cheese, but iI doubled the meat called for in the recipe to 2 lbs because the sandwiches are larger. I only needed one package of cheese because the slices are large and I used the buns without sesame seeds. I preheated the oven, prepared the sauce (without the horseradish) and spread it on both sides of the bun, about 3 slices of roast beef, 1 slice of provolone, wrap in foil and you&#039;re done! I made a dozen sandwiches and took them hot out of the oven and put them in an insulated bag and headed straight to the beach. Instant hit!"
37449,515596,2014/5/3,5,"This was easy and yummy too! I used red bell pepper, cremini mushrooms and red onion. Thanks for a quick and easy breakfast. Made for PAC event in the contest/event forum, spring 2014."
2002206758,530211,2018/7/3,5,Simple yet delicious caesar recipe!
1287956,495417,2013/3/21,5,"This doesn&#039;t taste diet.  However, I used the pre-cooked chicken strips, and then made up a cilantro-lime dressing in place of the mayo.  Quick, easy and delicious!"
2001153734,533918,2017/11/22,4,"Very good! If I could do half stars I'd say 4.5 because I think it needs a little crunch of finely chopped celery and a little less cheese. Also if preparing ahead, don't drizzle on the butter until backing time. But overall very good and I would make it again with the tweeks mentioned. I made it as is for the first time exactly as written"
1802478070,500552,2014/2/11,5,So yummy and so easy! Just happened to have everything except the V8. Substituted extra broth and half a can of tomato sauce. Definitely make it again!!
169430,497483,2013/6/30,5,"Wow,this is good stuff. I sampled it with thin whole wheat crackers and it was very good but I agree that it shine best on a more delicate base with a milder taste of it&#039;s own. For myself, I&#039;m getting some strawberries to dip and enjoy feeling like a pampered lady for awhile. I whizzed the cheese, half and half and honey together then added whole pistachio&#039;s that I had just shelled and ran it all until I liked the size of the nuts. It worked perfectly. It  is rich so a little goes a long way."
47892,497483,2013/7/27,5,"Well, I didn&#039;t have orange blossom honey and instead used local clover honey. The big difference is I did not bake the mixture rather spread it on a plate fresh. The cheese I used &lt;br/&gt;was a local ch&egrave;vre from local goats (not those &#039;other&#039; goats ;)) I added a few strands of orange zest on the top for color and to compensate for having no orange blossom honey. Served with good quality whole grain water crackers. Delicious! Made for Ramadan Tag July 2013."
37449,497483,2013/8/19,5,This was so yummy and a real treat. Thanks duonyte!
1803280910,512752,2014/10/30,4,"My first attempt. Halved the recipe and made 11 shortbread at the end (could&#039;ve made 12 if I didn&#039;t mess up my first one) I don&#039;t have square baking moulds, used silicon cup instead. I followed the instruction shaping the shortbread into small balls and gently flattened into the silicon cup, then pressed the cup to shap four round corners. It turned out just as fine. Took me twice as long to cook the pineapple filling. It might be my hob isn&#039;t very powerful. The filling turned out just the right sweetness to my liking. The pastry is soft and crumbly that just melts in my mouth. Delicious!!"
169430,505539,2013/8/18,5,"Oh SO Good!. I made one huge chop for DH and I. Lowered the sweeting (Spenda for me) to just 1/4 tsp and ended up with one amazing pork chop. I cooked it on the grill for ZWT9 ~ Tradition with a Twist of Innovation challenge. This was simply delicious, full of great flavor - moist and very tender. Really a delight."
305531,505539,2013/8/19,5,"Loved this! I had a huge pork chop and ate it all, lol. The rub caramelized on the chop and was so good. Thanks for sharing this keeper, Susie. Made for ZWT9."
865936,505539,2013/8/24,5,Just terrific!  The flavor was spectacular and very complementary.  I chose to cut my pork chops in three and skewer it only for a zwf challenge.  It cooked up very tender and delicious.
228458,505539,2013/8/25,5,"Well, these get 4 stars from me for ease of preparation and the 5th star for how much the carnivores in my family enjoyed them. In typical guy fashion DH just said between mouthfuls &quot;they&#039;re pretty good!&quot;, which for him is a rave review LOL. Instead of rice I served these with recipe #304665, which also paired nicely. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
653438,503733,2014/4/18,5,"Made this for Spring PAC 2014 and for our late lunch today.  I really enjoyed this.  I used whole wheat tortillas and mixed hot sauce into the mayonnaise before spreading onto the tortilla and I also used pepper jack cheese..  Easy, simple and very delicious."
1803003954,517609,2014/8/7,5,This is a simple recipe and my kids loved it. I usually love to experiment with the peppers. Using banana peppers is a clever way of adding sweetness to the dish. The cheese and sausage add an amazing aroma. Simply awesome! Thanks for sharing this.
1803118857,517609,2014/9/9,5,A sweet stuffed peppers for a change! I love the recipe. Have tried it twice and would repeat this week! I have used different peppers last time and think about sticking to banana peppers this time! Great share!
145245,498911,2013/6/4,5,Made as written.  They turned out beautifully.
2889958,498911,2013/7/4,5,"I made these as written, although it was so humid out that I had to add quite a bit of flour. They turned out so beautifully! Wonderful recipe!"
610488,504318,2013/8/26,5,I loved this dish alot! I do think there has got to be an easier way to make it since having to check on the water level was a bit of a pain. Very creamy and moist. Made a wonderful gravy over the rice. Be warned - Very Spicy!!!
227978,505539,2013/8/26,5,"Fabulous dish, Susie D!  The pork chops cooked so nicely, and what a wonderful Asian flair.  Yum!  The only thing I did differently was to put them in the oven (instead of skillet) to let them roast alongside the potatoes I made as a side dish.  I was so glad to see I didn&#039;t need to marinate the chops for several hours, too.  So I will keep this recipe handy for those evenings  when we want something exotic but don&#039;t have hours to wait for marinating time.  Made for ZWT #9 (SE Asia)."
128473,505539,2014/1/27,5,"Wow, Susie D, were these simple little pork chops great.  We loved them prepared this way.  So tender and moist and full of flavor.  The dh was so thrilled, he was licking his lips from the moment he came in the door and smelled them cooking.  Made them exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  I used boneless, pork loin chops they worked great in this dish.  The spice was perfection, we really enjoyed the way the rub caramelized on the pork chops.  Thank you so  much for sharing a recipe that we will be enjoying again and again.  Made for Best of 2013 it will be going into my cookbook for best of 2014.  Kudos to you my friend."
482933,505539,2014/1/30,5,"Definitely delicious! Moist tender, easy prep. Caramelized nicely. And appreciate that I always have these ingredients on hand. Thank you for sharing."
4439,505539,2014/3/10,4,"too much ground ginger and too much red pepper flakes and we are not wooses. Next time I make i will use 1/4 of the ground ginger and cut the red pepper flakes in 1/2 and then this recipe will be great. update 3/9/14 did not use the ginger, but still a little too harsh, next  time I will cut back on the coriander to 1 teaspoon and a little less brown sugar. We love the pork chops, so moist and juicy and flavorful, but the spices are off a little bit for us. Will keep on trying and will keep on trying."
482376,505539,2014/3/21,5,"Delicious! This was so simple to make, too. The pork chops were full of flavor and nicely browned. Easy and great flavor = a wonderful recipe. Thank you!"
280271,505539,2015/1/26,5,We loved it...not sure about it being Vietnamese...only because we are unfamiliar with the flavor...but we sure enjoyed this...made for Best of 2014 tag game...=)
165933,505539,2015/1/29,5,This was great!  I used pork medallions and let them marinate in the rub for 3-4 hours.  DH loved the flavors which made me chuckle to myself as he claims he HATES ginger and coriander!  I want to try this on chicken next.  Thanks.
133174,505539,2018/2/10,5,I made this awhile back. The seasonings were spot on and blended together very well. Did not change a thing. As always thank you for a wonderful recipe.
80353,503888,2013/7/16,5,"I made this recipe, which we much enjoyed as a kind of greek &#039;fusion&#039; meal, served in a pita, like a souvlaki, and dressed with tzatziki - it was AWESOME.  Thanks very much."
128473,506126,2015/10/19,5,"Thank you for sharing another wonderful beverage recipe Sharon.  You never disappoint.  This is wonderful.  I made my own guava nectar for this recipe, it was so easy and tasted really good.  

I love that you can taste the ginger, guava and lime in this drink.  The punch is smooth and velvety, sweet and tart, simple perfection.

Kudos on making it into my Best of Cookbook for 2015.  

Made for Think Pink 2015."
250589,516376,2014/6/6,0,"tried this recipe and was a total failure, mush"
143721,501720,2013/9/15,5,Made as directed and served over steamed broccoli and carrots.  Very nice!  I think this would be good just mixed with steamed rice or noodles.  Made for Football Poll 2013
526411,512595,2014/2/9,5,"This was mine and my husband&#039;s first green smoothie.  Neither one of us tasted the spinach when we drank them.  I used frozen blueberries, frozen raspberries, and fresh bananas.  It was great.  Next time, I will make it with strawberries instead of raspberries due to the seeds.  Thanks so much for this  post.  Now I know I can drink green smoothies!  I made this for &quot;New Kids on The Block&quot; tag game."
266635,512595,2014/2/15,5,"Great smoothie.  The only change I made was to use 2% organic milk vs. the almond milk.  Used fresh blueberries, strawberries and of course bananas.  What a nice way to start out the morning.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag, February, 2014."
1802674345,512305,2014/4/16,0,Although most Shrimp in Lobster sauce recipes do include ground pork PF Chang&#039;s does not. I asked about this specific ingredient today at the restaurant. This recipes sounds like it would be a good tasting recipe but it is not a &quot;copy cat&quot; due to the pork.
37449,511925,2014/5/19,5,Made the pickles yesterday and the fish today. Very tasty! I served in soft flatbread pita. Thanks!
865936,503350,2014/3/16,4,"This came out very well and I liked it a lot.  I just think it should be less grapefruit juice and more lemon and/or lime.  I used sliced pork shoulder for the medallions and was concerned that they might turn out tough.  They were nice and tender, so I guess it really doesn&#039;t matter which cut you choose for this."
566599,496324,2013/5/19,5,I made a similar version without the cheese cube inside.  It was a 5 star hit for our Halloween Dinner Party.  See the pics for the steps to make my mice.
2001297534,533583,2018/1/23,4,"I made this recipe as written. Being the directions were a little vague I minced the garlic and fried the shrimp garlic combination under medium/high heat, The recipe was easy to put together and had a lot of flavor. When I make this dish next time I plan on adding some red pepper flake to add a little kick. Thank you for sharing."
1926388,498979,2013/4/16,3,My son likes this one
1925885,506309,2014/9/10,4,"This was such an easy recipe and looks like it will be quite delicious. I&#039;m giving a temporary four star review because I won&#039;t be able to taste these for a few days, while they pickle. But the brine was good, and besides, how can you go wrong with anything that has garlic, chilies, and ginger?  I stayed with the recipe, but admit to adding an extra slice or two of ginger, an extra chile per jar, and an extra clove of garlic."
498271,513631,2014/3/20,5,These really were great tortillas!  You did a good job on your ingredient &quot;guesswork&quot; - my tortillas had a very nice taste and texture and were quite easy to make.  I made 1/4 of the recipe for the 2 tortillas I needed.  With just the two of us we don&#039;t often use a whole pack of 12 or 20 tortillas so this may be a recipe I use often instead of just &quot;out of desperation&quot; ;)  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
542159,513631,2015/9/5,5,Excited that this worked and can be cut down to make just a few tortillas as the packages at the store are always too big for us. I skipped the 15 minute chill time and they still turned out perfectly. Thanks for a great alternative to all the leftover tortillas.
2597942,502683,2014/5/19,0,"I tried this just because it sounded a little different. Was this suppose to be a joke, or do people really drink this? I&#039;m not sure what to think of the brief intro. What makes this healthy? Sorry, I didn&#039;t care for this at all. (Made for PAC 2014)"
83314,502683,2014/5/21,5,"God gave you a brain for a reason - take 10 minutes of your time to research the benefits of apple cider vinegar instead of wondering if the recipe is a joke, asking if people really drink it, and expecting the recipe poster to list all the health benefits.  By the way, the health benefits are plentiful.  I sip a glass daily and have for years.  And anyone who thinks water with vinegar in it will be a pleasant taste should not try the recipe."
865936,505956,2014/3/10,5,This couldn&#039;t be easier or more flavorful. I loved the strong citrus flavor.
810307,505138,2013/11/13,2,"Taste was okay, but it was very dry and fell apart while cooking"
280271,505956,2014/3/4,5,I&#039;m giving this 5 stars for the spicy tart flavor...not for presentation...I would have liked to see the chicken brown lots more...with that said both hubby and I enjoyed the heat and the tartness this dish gave us...it was something unusual and greatly appreciated...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
350921,500881,2013/7/25,5,"We started eating paleo two weeks ago, and this is the best entree yet!  Recommend for anyone who likes spicy."
1951388,500881,2013/9/18,0,"Delicious!  They are very spicy, next time I will use only one chipotle pepper.  I loved them, but they were too spicy for my kids."
1742363,500881,2014/1/25,5,"This recipe was super simple, quick and easy to make. Spicy + Lime = Heaven for my family. I am vegetarian so I actually substituted tofu for the chicken; worked out great. Super yummy and flavorful."
370332,500881,2016/9/9,5,So good and so easy! I've made this a few times now and I like it best with lots of chipotle and extra lime and cilantro. My kids like a little heat and they devour these and even enjoy helping me make them. Such a win served with Mexican caulirice! Thank you so much for posting!
2001560388,529728,2017/6/19,0,I have some questions: 1) What size pizza pan? 2) What kind of pizza sauce? Doesn't look as though red sauce was used in the photo. 3) 5 T. of corn? Looks like a lot more in the photo. It is always so helpful when a recipe contributor remembers to give details.
2001968944,529728,2018/2/2,0,I have some concerns. While this pizza looks amazing vegetables release lots of water. How do you keep the pizza from being soggy? Thanks.
1802779270,516214,2014/5/28,5,"You made my day ( or should I say afternoon) with this one, What really added a twist was the nutmeg, thanks, 5 stars from a big breakfast lover who had this for as a afternoon snack with the kids. Nutmeg and cinnamon on french toast are a real delight."
895132,517429,2014/8/7,5,"Great salad! It&#039;s quite similar to the Romanian salad my dad used to make, so I had to try this one :) DH and I had an entire bowl for dinner and both agreed that it&#039;s clear five stars. Thanks for sharing!!"
1803590361,517429,2014/12/31,5,"I love it. A tradition for New Year&#039;s Eve celebration. &lt;br/&gt;I often add black olives for taste and for decorations. Some people add sour apples, grated, like Granny Smith. The meat ingredient is not mandatory, and can be changed from chicken to cut up hotdog, or even crab meat, or shrimp."
2000074333,517429,2015/3/20,5,"Ok, I did this basically as shown except replaced a little cooked bacon for the chicken and probably added more mayo than suggested.
Family all say it&#039;s excellent, best ever, when are you making it again? - you get the drift."
2001802746,517429,2017/11/18,0,"I do it a little different, I add parsley not dill, I also add bacon, tiny chopped celery, mustard , 1 teaspoon sugar, olive oil and allot of black pepper. I also use Helmans mayo. It really makes a difference!!"
2001326589,512380,2016/12/29,0,"I made this, but didn't have walnut oil. All I had was olive, canola, safflower, or black truffle, so I tried it with the black truffle. May not have been the best choice, but I thought it complimented the rosemary well and I devoured them without sharing...."
599450,503093,2013/8/11,5,"Made as directed in the rice cooker -- all the way! That made this so easy! Great comfort food! Thanks, Dienia! Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
447487,503093,2013/8/11,5,"Served this lovely grits recipe up with Recipe #369067. Made mine with a &quot;dairy free&quot; cheese as I&#039;m allergic and a cheddar/jack mixture for the kids.

212609,511085,2013/12/30,5,"I love champagne and I love cranberry juice.....and I really love the two of them mixed together. This made for a very festive tipple, that we really enjoyed.&lt;br/&gt;Also a great way to make your champagne go just that little bit further!!&lt;br/&gt;A keeper for sure.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
926999,535375,2018/3/24,0,The title is wrong because my wife makes the BEST potato salad. Sorry. :) :)
135470,499688,2013/5/27,4,"For me these were closer to 3 stars for flavor - though DH said a solid 4 star, but I gave them the higher level for an interesting ingredient and just being different. I was surprised how little &quot;batter&quot; there is, it was difficult to keep them together I ended up using a little extra flour and a little more oil then stated. The calendula didn&#039;t add any extra flavor but it looked good - almost like flecks of carrot - I would add more next time to see if it would give more flavor or try nasturtium. The corn gets a nice tasty toasty flavor but the batter part is fairly bland, some onion or garlic powder would help and an extra sprinkle of salt at the end was good. I did make some lime aioli for dipping and it was a really good accompaniment.  May for &quot;My Food Odyssey&quot; - Angola&lt;br/&gt;&#039;"
128473,505736,2014/5/7,4,"Wow, wow, wow.  Were these babies ever hot.  The tabasco sauce completely overpowered the sauce for me, the mango flavor was completely lost.  I did add more corn syrup to try and minimize the heat.  Loved the zing from the Habanero though.  That said, when drizzled over the chicken wings, this sauce tasted pretty good. It was thick and velvety and coated them beautifully. Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
1802664122,505981,2014/4/13,5,My family absolutely loves this recipe. Definitely a family favorite!
2001468025,529766,2017/4/2,5,"Great recipe. Much easier to make than traditional babka, but with impressive results. The loaves were delicious and looked pretty cool, though my loaves did end up looking very different from the picture published with the recipe. (Sprinkles tend to melt when baked, and the chocolate chips that ended up on top of the loaf retained their shapes -- but it still looked fun and festive.) Also, I think there might be an error in the amount of butter listed for the topping. The video shows two sticks (one cup) but the recipe only calls for a half cup. Everything turned out well with just the half cup of butter, but it resulted in a topping consistency that was much less spreadable and frosting-like than what is shown in the video."
1802940935,509014,2014/7/21,5,"Delicious, these were a BIG hit with the family!"
1625919,509014,2016/10/12,5,"If I had to pick a last meal, this would be it. Light, crispy, fresh and delicious. There's never any leftovers for lunch with this one!"
2743089,496542,2013/3/18,5,This dish is good.  The Bankston&#039;s loved it!!!
2744065,496542,2013/3/19,5,"These are my favorite side dish.   So quick, easy and great!"
2744101,496542,2013/3/19,5,This my all time favorite dish!  I could eat these everyday and not get tired of them.
2744710,496542,2013/3/20,5,It was amazing!!!! We will eat it again very soon. Thanks from the Gray family:)
542159,503766,2013/7/21,5,Oompa! Jackie your description of these potatoes was spot on in that they are loaded with Greek flavors and turn out tender yet very nicely browned. We really like the way the lemon and herbs come together to keep these potatoes from being anything but boring.  Thanks for the post.
382203,503766,2013/9/16,4,very nice
482376,503766,2016/8/15,5,"Yummy potatoes! We loved the flavors. The potatoes crisped up very nicely, too. This made for a wonderful and easy side dish for our Greek meal. Thank you."
266635,503766,2016/8/16,5,Another winner of a Greek side dish to go with our meal tonight. I used new potatoes and they were seasoned perfectly and the addition of the lemon juice really stepped up the flavor.
305531,503766,2016/8/16,5,Such a nice side for a Greek meal. They are simple and good. Thanks for sharing. Made for CQ3 - Greece.
2703353,495488,2013/2/20,5,"I made this for my husband who is a real kielbasa and sauerkraut fan.  He loved it!  It is such a unique pizza and I liked having a switch from the normal soup and or sandwich lunch.  I liked the choice of muenster cheese, it complimented the tangy sauerkraut well.  Definitely 5 stars - I will make this again."
2708470,495488,2013/2/24,5,This was delicious.  I loved the proportion of kielbasa to saurkraut and the muenster was a good touch.  I will make it again.
2711763,495488,2013/2/25,5,"Loved this.  Its a whole meal on a pizza crust!  Seriously though, the mashed potatoes and sauerkraut together with the kielbasa was delicious.  Plus, it was really easy to make."
2711815,495488,2013/2/25,5,"I really liked this.  I wanted to try something a little different, yet something that I knew my family would all eat. I'm glad I tried this recipe, as it was really good."
2665338,495488,2013/2/27,0,Wonderful combination of flavors - comfort at its finest!
2667767,495488,2013/2/27,5,"This one and a stein of beer, yum."
2691324,495488,2013/3/7,5,This was great.  It was very easy to make and my wife and I liked it a lot.  The kielbasa/muenster/sauerkraut combination tasted very good.  I am glad my wife and I tried this recipe.
2688935,495488,2013/3/7,5,"I tried this pizza for a quick and easy weeknight dinner.  It was fast, easy to make and tasted really good.  I served it with salad and applesauce on the side.  It was very good and I'll make it again."
1802818362,493957,2014/6/12,0,"I used to live in Swansea Ma., and went to Nick&#039;s all the time. While this recipe is mediocre at best, it doesn&#039;t even come close to resemblance. Reminds me of when Emeril does a take on a recipe....usually screws it up, as this sauce recipe did. sorry, NO stars"
2001388983,493957,2017/9/9,0,I don't think Fall River sauce has chili powder. Cumin and celery salt are the secret with Kamen skinless and steamed buns. I prefer the crustless buns from ? Holdup.
125853,505682,2014/3/23,5,"Wow!  These are some tasty spicy ribs!  I love the dry rub method.  Then, Uncle Ronnie and his crowd can add Stubbs BBQ sauce at the table, and the rest of us can enjoy a delicious smoky rib!  Thanks to you and your hubby.... Judging from these ribs you all must be one spicy couple!!"
2729810,495488,2013/3/10,5,This tasted very good.  It was also easy to make and my whole family liked it.  This recipe will be made again in my house.
2206320,495488,2013/3/12,5,I am celebrating Octoberfest in March!!!  Delicious!!!
2002261712,503417,2018/9/7,5,"I've made this many times. It's a family favorite. We like to serve it on top of a bed of couscous, with grilled asparagus and corn on the cob. Quick, easy, and satisfying. Great recipe."
480195,503417,2013/9/6,5,I marinated the chicken for 2 hrs. What terrific flavor! This was a huge hit. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
242766,503417,2016/8/2,5,"Delicious! The pineapple salsa was the real star of this recipe...it was so yummy! My store didn't have pineapple tidbits, so I had to use pineapple chunks instead. I probably should have cut the chunks into smaller pieces, but I was too lazy and the chunks worked just fine for us. I marinated the chicken breasts for about 6 hours so that they would really soak up the marinade. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! **Made for 2016 Culinary Quest - Bahamas for the Pi Rho Maniacs**"
157425,503417,2016/8/3,5,"Terrific chicken and the pineapple salsa was great. I only added a pinch or two of red pepper flakes, took the seeds out of the jalapeno and used parsley instead of cilantro. Marinated the chicken for 8 hours and made salsa 1/2 hour before grilling chicken. Enjoyed a bite of chicken with every bite of salsa! Easy and quick supper to make on a hot humid day. Thank you for sharing! Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest 2016 - Bahamas."
1680722,503417,2016/8/4,5,"Wow! So tender, good and colorful! I had a small pinapple on hand and to prepare the juice I used som chopped pineapple and I pressed out the juice using the garlic press. As the enzymes (they work as meat tenderizer) of fresh pineapple are more active than the canned ones, only few spoons are enough. Thanks so much, we had a really outstanding meal!!!"
226863,503417,2017/8/30,5,Very easy to make and great tasting! I had my heart set on making this and ended up grilling when Hurricane Harvey sent some bands through my area of Florida! Still turned out fabulous. The salsa is great and a perfect accompaniment to the chicken. Made for the Smok'in Chefs and CQ 2017.
135470,503417,2017/9/2,5,"So delicious! The marinade gives the chicken great flavor and kept it moist. The onion in the salsa was a little strong, I might use a sweet onion next time. I used a whole chicken cut in half. Made for Culinary Quest"
690623,503417,2017/9/6,5,What a great summertime meal! The marinade imparted a lovely fresh flavour that did not overwhelm the chicken and the pineapple Salsa was the perfect accompaniment! Made for CQ4
227978,503417,2017/9/7,5,"This was fabulous! And it was so easy to prepare, too. The pineapple salsa was really wonderful with the grilled chicken. I made it as written and didn't make any adjustments. We all really enjoyed it. My photo isn't as enticing as the others, but the dish is honestly quite delicious. I served the Grilled Chicken with Black Bean, Corn and Tomato Relish (as a side salad) and Baked Bananas. It was a great meal! Thanks, PanNan. Made for Culinary Quest 2017 (Central America)."
2733959,495488,2013/3/12,5,So easy to make!
2739627,495488,2013/3/16,5,I made this two nights ago and my whole family enjoyed it.  My son calls is mashed potato pizza.
2767670,495488,2013/4/3,5,Yum!  I made this last weekend for my family and they really liked it.  They liked the kielbasa so much I will probably swap out pepperoni for kielbasa next time I make a traditional pizza.  This recipe is a keeper.
140132,495488,2013/9/17,5,This was such a fun pizza to make for my family.  They all looked at it like I was crazy at first.  Until they tried it.  DS couldn&#039;t get enough of it.  I did use my own mashed potatoes otherwise followed your recipe to a T.  Thank you for sharing this fun recipe with me and my family.
2001181876,513235,2018/2/17,4,45 minutes is long enough in my oven and it came out great!!

2427866,503766,2017/3/16,5,Sooo good and simple. Everyone went back for seconds.
280271,511088,2014/5/6,4,This is getting 4 stars only because it took like 4 hours for my flank steak to get even close to shredding...the meat mixture was delicious...not sure about the sauce...but my picking son-in-law ate about 3 of them and took lots home for leftovers...that says a lot...I served them with sour cream and salsa...the directions are a bit confusing...I&#039;m use to following the ingredients along with the directions..this was all over the place...but we did enjoy it...Made for Spring 2014 PAC...=)
369715,501294,2013/8/6,4,I put the chili and the hot dogs in the crockpot and everyone enjoyed it. I used chili without beans as that is what my family prefers.
212609,501294,2013/8/31,5,"Made with homemade chilli...this was my children&#039;s first encounter of a chilli dog....they absolutely loved it, and have had me make it several more times....especially when they have friends over.&lt;br/&gt;A massive hit...thank you pammyowl xx&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
2597942,501294,2013/9/7,5,"Made these tonight for the 3 of us (we have a boarder staying with us now, ugh). Anyway, neither of the boys came home for dinner, so I made up just 1 for myself and put the remainder in the fridge to serve for lunch tomorrow. These are super simple to make (a no brainer that hubby could even make). So for the price and how good they are, they are well worth it. Great for feeding a group on a small budget. I like the cheese and raw onion... nice toppers. Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
542159,501294,2013/11/9,5,"Oh what great memory&#039;s these bring back and they are a timeless favorite of young and old alike. These were made and enjoyed in Pammy&#039;s memory may she rest in peace; she will be sorely missed but never forgotten, so glad that she took the time posted such a great timeless recipe."
305531,501294,2013/11/10,5,Great chili dogs. I made as directed except that I sliced the hotdogs because both of us wanted 2 chili dogs and I only had 3 hotdogs left. Chopping them seemed to make us think that we got more. lol. This is a nice keeper that I will make again. Made and enjoyed in Pammy&#039;s memory. RIP sweet lady.
131126,501294,2013/11/11,5,Chili dogs were perfect for a overcast fall day.  I used Hormel Hot chili with no beans and sliced the wieners as suggested by lazyme in her review.  This was an easy recipe using ingredients on hand. Served on toasted buns with corn on the cob and Recipe #222197.
28177,501294,2013/11/12,5,"You can&#039;t go wrong with a good chili dog.  I made a quick batch of our favorite chili recipe, Recipe #21936, and dinner was ready in 30 minutes.  Served with a side salad, this was a cheap and easy meal after a long day at work and school.  We&#039;ll remember you each time we have this good ole&#039; comfort food, Pammy.  Made and enjoyed in her honor."
653438,501294,2013/11/12,5,"Made this for the Cook-a-thon in Memory of Pammyowl and this is another winner!   So simple and so delicious.  I did make homemade chili and served it on toasted buns with cheese, onions and a few sliced jalapenos.   Also a green salad was made for a side."
546010,501294,2013/11/12,5,What&#039;s not to love? Used my recipe for chili recipe#496140 Made in honor of PammyOwl. RIP Pammy!
226863,501294,2013/11/13,5,Wow! Does this bring back memories....but not of college but of high school.  Things were a bit &quot;relaxed&quot; at my school and my girlfriends and I went out every day for lunch.  Chili-Cheese dogs were a favorite back then.  Just wish I could still eat 3 at one sitting and still be skinny...LOL. Delicious indulgence.  Made in memory of Pammyowl.  We will miss you here at food.com.
296809,501294,2013/11/13,5,"Chili-cheese dogs have always been a pers fave for me. Growing up, it was a family tradition to have them every Sat for lunch &amp; no one missed this meal. Now I live in a country where the most popular restaurant is a hot-dog stand! ... But the C-C dog is not the fave of the genre for Icelanders, so I always bring canned hot dog chili (no beans) back from our US trips to satisfy my appetite. I made 1 chg &amp; 1 addition to your recipe. I added sweet pickle relish &amp; subbed crisp fried onions for the chopped raw onion (an Icelandic idea I favor). Thx for the trip down memory lane &amp; the streets of Iceland. I miss you."
135566,501294,2013/11/14,5,"My mother made chili dogs once a week while I was growing up as it was an inexpensive and easy meal to feed a family of eight. This is total comfort food for me. I toasted the bun and used red onion and, of course, served with Fritos.  Made for Pammy&#039;s cookathon."
695933,501294,2013/11/16,5,"I halved the recipe and added the chili powder to taste rather than measuring. By the end of 2 hours +/- this was very good. Almost tasted like sloppy joes, in fact I may use it as such in the future. Thanks for posting. Next time I&#039;ll follow the directions better and I&#039;ll update my review when I do.UPDATE 11/16/13 I use halfsmok to day and it was great.&lt;br/&gt;Thank You!.. Pam..... Grpa"
895132,501294,2013/11/16,5,"So yummy! I used gluten free chili beans and a gluten free bun, and a kind of sheep&#039;s cheese which is similar to cheddar. Soo good. Makes me remember our talk about street and fair food :)&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for the fond memories, dear friend.&lt;br/&gt;Made for the Cookathon in memory of pammyowl November 2013"
133174,501294,2013/11/16,5,"Yep, this is the way I have made chili-cheese dogs for years!  Makes a quick and inexpensive go to meal.  The only thing I do different is add in some mustard.  Made in memory of pammyowl."
482376,501294,2013/11/20,5,"5 stars for an easy and tasty treat. I used the Hormel without beans, too. Yummy, easy and inexpensive dinner. Made in the memory of Pammyowl."
88099,501294,2013/11/23,5,Love my chili dogs made this way.  I did toast the buns and added mustard and a little relish.  I also fried the split hot dogs.  I used my own Chili recipe #146288 that I had in the freezer.  Made in memory of Pammy.
2754389,501294,2014/4/29,5,"Love me an occasional chili cheese dog!  Sometimes I make a pan full at a time, in the oven!  Hot, toasty, delicious!  Gotta have some yellow mustard on it too! The hot dogs and chili still need to be warmed first though."
1802849661,520701,2015/7/15,4,Great idea and they look really pretty as well! My fianc&eacute; loved taking these to work instead of his normal boring sandwich!
80353,503956,2013/7/20,5,This was delicious and a lovely presentation as well!  I loved the feta-yoghurt filling.  I did seed and lightly squeeze my tomatoes as they are delicious and juicy and I didn&#039;t want all that liquid dampening the filo crust.  We all loved this tart and I will most definitely make again.
1052873,522831,2015/8/3,5,"Very tasty, although next time I might add more spice. I used coleslaw mix for the cabbage which made it easy, and sliced everything very thin with the mandolin slicer."
2000668467,529848,2017/2/22,0,Red onion omitted from list of ingredients. I'll be making this salad soon!
2057387,493698,2016/6/7,5,My neighbor lady made this jelly and shared the recipe with me. I am ADDICTED to it. It is the BEST jelly I have ever tasted!!! I like it on cream cheese and bagels and on biscuits and even in my vanilla yogurt. Try it on top of chicken breasts in the crockpot with slices of onion added and serve with rice. I think the different ways to use this jelly are limitless! I cannot wait to make some for myself in BIG batches--ha! Kahtie
2001874936,493698,2017/12/21,0,I tried this receipe for my first time and it came out delicious i was impressed I'm from Louisiana 12/19/17 review by Patricia B.
724631,500336,2013/12/5,3,"Rating is for the way the recipe was written up, because the pie was delicious and it looked fantastic.  Between the original ingredients list and the tips in Step 4, it was very confusing.  Fortunately I had all necessary ingredients on hand because I rely on the Food.com Shopping List.  I used 2 tablespoons flour, 1 Tbsp. cornstarch, the sugars, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 dash freshly grated nutmeg, 1 pinch ground allspice, 1 pinch ground cloves and 1 Tbsp. vanilla.  I beat 1 egg white to glaze the bottom crust and baked that 2 minutes before loading filling.  My 8 Granny Smith apples weighed 4.32 lbs, and seemed 2 stories high stacked in the pie plate, although by serving time they settled into a plump mound above the top of the pie plate. (Eight medium Granny Smith apples would weight 3 lbs according the the USDA nutrient database.)  My lattice top crust perched atop the apple pile, and I could not crimp edges.  I gave up on brushing milk on the top crust.  The lattice design was lost by the time the pie emerged from the oven.  My guests LOVED the sauce on the top crust.  Although the pie had cooled completely prior to serving, the sauce did not congeal, but stayed a (delicious) gooey liquid.  Although I baked the pie for more than the maximum time, my guests said the apples were slightly undercooked.  My guests said there was no need to sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the crust.  I liked that this apple pie was definitely an APPLE PIE in which the apples dominated the sauce.  I used a Wegman&#039;s double-pie crust, and was very pleased with it; my guests suggested making a focaccia with the crust topped by the sauce.  I am not used to baking, but I will make this pie again, as our group can&#039;t get enough apple pie.

2001912421,507743,2018/1/4,5,"I like the idea of a quick and easy soup using canned chicken as it was snowing today and I didn't want to go out. I used the basics of this recipe and tweaked to what I had in my pantry. I sauteed carrots onions and celery and chicken in lemon infused olive oil and garlic infused olive oil. Instead of noodles I used sprouted lentils. A little salt and pepper, another spice with citrus peel, garlic nd shallots made for a very delicious soup.!"
2690449,494865,2013/2/12,0,This is a great dish.  We are on the 17 day diet and this quick and easy recipe will be with us long after the diet is gone.
2001446332,517761,2017/3/20,2,"I made this as it was beautiful but the texture was way too stiff, example: As I served this pie and guests were eating it a bite fell off the fork and actually bounced. I would definitely cut the cornstarch down. under 7 tablespoons. I remade the pie a few weeks later lowering the ratio of cornstarch and then the pie was wonderful. Truly yummy!"
2238954,516015,2014/5/24,5,"I admit I was skeptical but sure enough, awesome flavor!  I marinated for a few extra hours but otherwise I wouldn&#039;t change much, maybe a little extra jalapeno juice."
482933,512207,2014/5/6,5,Enjoyed this very much! Was hoping to find a yeast apple bread that was easy and this fits the bill. Doubled the cinnamon otherwise made as posted. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
2001047423,535652,2018/5/9,5,"I made it with tomatoes &amp; generic 'chillis'; I loved the kiwi flavour which was different to what I usually see in Mexican recipes. Next time I will make with Tomatillos, I can send off for them in the UK."
2001819303,507410,2017/11/23,0,Has anyone tried this with marshmallows on top?
560491,497680,2013/4/16,5,"I made these a little different, but they still had pretty much the same outcome... I made these in mini-muffin form and rather than folding in the raspberries I scooped the batter into the muffin cups and pressed a raspberry into the middle.  I also sprinkled a little crystalized sugar on top for garnish.  I ate a muffin (around the raspberry since I don&#039;t like them) and the muffin was very moist and tender.  I think I will make these again but add blueberries or strawberries (though DH loved the raspberry).  Made for Spring PAC 2013."
895132,494794,2014/4/29,5,"Yummy egg salad and great instructions on how to boil eggs so you can easily peel them! I&#039;ve learned this method from my mom and always use it, it&#039;s really the best way to do. Being in Germany, I didn&#039;t have this particular mayo, but used home made mayo. Thanks for posting, this was a really yummy egg salad!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1803589683,507072,2014/12/31,5,This recipe is Awesome!!!  Tastes just like Outback steakhouse potato soup.... Outstanding!
1776075,507072,2016/1/18,5,"Decadently delicious. Made this on a cold winter afternoon, and followed the directions with one minor exception. I didn&#039;t have any low-sodium broth, so I used regular. Then I omitted any other salt. The result was creamy, rich, and yummy. Next time I may eliminate the sour cream, or reduce it, because I thought there was too much &quot;tang.&quot; Unfortunately, I won&#039;t make this often because of the high fat content, but it is spot on for an occasional indulgence."
1500306,510983,2014/2/8,5,What a great story to share for Christmas! I make homemade candy as gifts and I intend to include some bought M&amp;M&#039;s with my gifts this next Christmas so I can also share it. My first review so I hope I did it right. DAR Lady
165933,518641,2014/9/26,5,"Simply had to make this bread today with my fresh rosemary!  The kitchen smelled wonderful while it was baking!  I divided the dough and baked in two bread pans so my fussy DH could fit it in the toaster.  Free formed bread just confuses him!  For my taste this recipe needs less sugar, perhaps 1T and it needs salt!  When I make it again I will make those adjustments.  I tasted the bread without any butter and literally could not taste the spices but when I buttered the next slice the rosemary, onion and garlic flavors popped out!  With the two bread pans I baked them for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, perfect results with my oven!  I cannot wait to bake this again.  Thanks."
2001271871,513093,2016/11/26,5,Very good recipe. I made a few changes by cooking vanilla bean with the mixture. Also another change was putting a half of a fresh peach in the jar with the finished product it really kicks up the flavor.
1553277,511922,2014/7/18,5,Tastes just like the soup my grandmother makes.
1625919,511922,2016/10/12,0,"All I can say is yum! Was looking for something to whip up with ingredients I had at home and found this gem. So simple, but tasty. I like it as is, but my boyfriend loves dunking bread into his."
286566,493256,2014/2/14,5,"I doubled the recipe as my container of apricots was 1K, I froze them in a plastic container and once frozen I chopped it up so I could fit it into the food processor and added the sugar and lemon juice but after several minutes of trying to process it I took half of it out and it processed without difficulty to a lovely creamy smooth texture.  I served it with recipe #466271 466271 for a guilt free dessert that we all enjoyed.  Thank you Nancy&#039;s Pantry, made for Everyday A Holiday tag game."
2001985253,525818,2018/2/11,3,"I liked the cookies, but i added a little bit of flour, and they were not as good as another recipe I tried"
452355,504437,2013/8/30,5,"Loved this stir fry recipe!  DH and I made this for dinner last night and I could not stop eating it.  My only modification was that my peanuts were raw, unsalted versus roasted.  I don&#039;t think this made too much of a difference.  Also, I might increase the shrimp/broccoli mixture next time as I really liked it.  Thanks so much for posting.  Made for ZWT9"
582561,505290,2014/3/27,3,"Quick and easy.  Method mentions to put in vinegar, but the ingredients don&#039;t say how much to use. I put in about 2 tsps but felt the recipe lacked a bit a pizzazz. Served with plain boiled jasmine rice and Riata it made an easy midweek meal.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap March 2014."
107583,515578,2014/5/7,5,"Great recipe, just like my grandma used to make.  Wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
266635,501039,2013/10/11,4,"This dip is very good and different from other guacamole-type dips.  I like the idea of the sesame oil -- it really adds depth of flavor.  I did add additional sesame oil - a little goes a long way and some extra cumin. This dip has a flavor that really does &quot;grow&quot; on you -- it&#039;s healthy and really fresh tasting.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag, October, 2013."
266635,527557,2016/7/20,5,"Made this delicious and tender beef last night. I normally would not pair white wine with beef, but it really worked well. Loved the tangy taste that the wine and vinegar brought to the dish. I marinated the meat overnight and it just simmered on the stove until it was really tender."
2394745,515361,2014/10/13,5,"This very good, we really liked it.  I had many more apples (almost 3.5 lbs) so I increased the water a bit and added cinnamon &amp; ground cloves, a little more than a pinch.  Had great success!  I&#039;m going to make more very soon!  Thank you for posting this recipe."
133174,504689,2013/8/9,4,I cheated.  I tried making these with caned salmon and had problems with them falling apart.  An egg was added to help bind the patties together and some dill was added to the salmon mixture.  The slaw would be beautiful with both red and green cabbage.  Unfortunately I only had green in the fridge.  While the burgers were good the slaw was my favorite.  The burgers were served on buns topped with horseradish yogurt sauce and sliced onions and fresh tomatoes.  Made for ZWT9.
107135,504689,2013/8/10,5,"i like salmon patties and this is a good recipe, love the cucumber  in it . food processor  made it fast . the slaw is great loved. the mustard"

1592049,518145,2014/9/18,5,So Delicious and Full of Great Flavors...YUM :-)
2688819,495599,2013/2/16,0,This sounds like a crowd pleaser. I can't wait to try.
323186,507054,2013/10/4,5,"What a great way to enjoy brussel sprouts! I love these little veggies and am always so pleased when I find great recipes for them.   I did make a minor change,  I wasnt too sure about adding the tomatoes so early (DH hates cooked tomato skins), so I added half of them as directed,  the rest much closer to the end, and one or two pretty much as garnish ....   I quite liked the end result of some cooked in and some not!  I also had to use rosmarino pasta, essentially a slightly smaller version of orzo,  which I am beginning to think is just not available in this country,  a great shame.    Thank you Sharon,  really enjoyed this tasty dish!  Oh,  used the smokey seasoning as detailed in your recipe, lovely!  Made for PRMR tag game."
560491,507054,2013/10/28,5,I really likes this and served with chicken but could easily eat as a main dish.  I tried Karen Elizabeth&#039;s suggestion and added the tomatoes towards the end because I am not a huge fan of cooked/mushy tomatoes.  I also used white orzo and chicken broth.  I really liked the smokey seasoning and plan on putting it on my grilled pork chops.  I will for sure be making this again!  Made for My Three Chefs.
47559,504721,2013/8/9,5,"This is a really nice, fresh, and spicy condiment.  It&#039;s so easy to make and versatile.  I can see it served with beef, chicken and fish as well as bread, chips, potatoes, etc.  Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers ZWT9."
266635,515551,2014/5/31,5,"This pizza monkey bread was really tasty -- loved the spicy flavor from the sausage and the combination of the bbq sauce (used Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s) and the pizza sauce.  I used green onions vs. regular and if you are making this for the kids -- you could substitute a crumbled breakfast sausage if you don&#039;t feel they would like the Italian sausage.  For some reason, I could not get the roll tight enough, so I baked it whole and then cut it into pieces on a pizza stone.  Will definitely make this again.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag, May, 2014."
148221,500476,2013/9/24,5,"These reminded me of healthier version of hash browns rather than burgers, but they were quite tasty regardless!  I had intended to serve them as burgers, but I ended up serving them as hash browns with some jelly on toast on the side.  I think next time I&#039;ll make scrambled eggs to complete the whole &quot;breakfast for dinner&quot; theme.  Only thing I changed was I used one large regular potato rather than the three new potatoes.  Also, this made 12 4 x 4 inch patties for me, so I shaped the remaining mixture into patties and stored them in the fridge until the next day.  When I wanted to serve them the next day, I popped them in the microwave 20 seconds, just to take the chill off, and then cooked them as usual.  Worked like a charm!  Thanks for the recipe!"
280271,514820,2014/4/8,5,This is so yummy...I doubled the recipe for two...but mine ended up in the freezer for about 4 hours...we had unexpected company...so when I took them out of the freezer I zapped them in the microwave for 45 sec...I can see making banana pops with the ingredients...what a nice summer cool down treat...I made sure the banana&#039;s were totally covered...I didn&#039;t want them to turn dark...thanks for posting it...made for Spring 2014 PAC
2675994,494596,2013/2/3,5,Oh my gosh!!!!  This is wonderful!  I made it for friends and family on Superbowl Sunday.  Everyone loved it.  They not only licked their fingers clean but also cleaned the dip bowl.  I will not wait for a party to make this again.  My teenagers want it for after band practice next week!
2688947,494596,2013/2/11,5,"This dish is excellent!  It is a great appetizer (or meal) to bring to a party, or, have at home anytime!  Very tasty!"
2192460,494596,2013/2/11,5,"I made this for an office party and it was a H*U*G*E hit!  Very easy and creative use of Hidden Valley Ranch products that I always have on hand.  This is going in my ""go to"" recipe file!"
2694862,494596,2013/2/15,5,Delicious! Made these for my Bunco group and they cleaned the plate. Everyone wanted the recipe. Definitely a keeper recipe for get togethers.
2698301,494596,2013/2/17,5,"I was looking for something new to serve, so I thought I would give this a try.  WOW, by the time I was finished cooking EVERYONE was in the kitchen, and couldn't wait to take a bite.  LOVED IT, am going to make it again, and again and again."
2695942,494596,2013/2/18,5,"You should make these again, they were really good! I went back in the kitchen to get more and they were all gone!"
2704933,494596,2013/2/21,5,This recipe was delicious! I can't wait to eat these again!
2705067,494596,2013/2/21,5,I thought this recipe was fantastic!  My kids are very picky and they have asked me to make it again.  It was also very easy to make after work.  I'll be making it again!
2709575,494596,2013/2/24,5,These were tangy and spicy--really good!  I ate most of them myself and only left a couple for dad.  Thanks for letting us be your taste testers!
2710214,494596,2013/2/24,0,"I would give it fice strs, Really tasty and esy to do .Could be used as a main dish or appetizer.Would be good with ramen noodels or rice as a main dish .Good as an easy appetizer  too. You can also cahnge the heat by using a milder chili sauce rather than sirachi."
2200124,494596,2013/2/24,5,Wow!  What a great recipe......will be making it again!
2710240,494596,2013/2/24,5,I definitely will give this recipe a try. Looks great.
2722645,496625,2013/3/7,5,Omgoodness fabulous. Made this last night and everyone LOVED it. Adding this to our family faves.
482376,496625,2013/3/22,5,Fabulous! This takes the ordinary spinach salad and puts it &quot;over the top&quot; with the perfectly cooked and flavorful scallops. I halved the recipe for 2 people. We love it. Thank you! Made for Spring 2013 PAC.
2002101946,532289,2018/4/8,0,What's the ration for poultry seasoning? It just says 2. 2 of what?
2002326068,532289,2018/11/9,1,"I looked at the ingredients for the brand maruchan and comparing it to this recipe, this recipe seems to be missing turmeric, chicken flavor, soy sauce, celery seed, and cabbage. The actual ingredients doesn't have pepper or ginger in it."
2002361267,532289,2018/12/9,1,Do NOT use all the pepper that is listed!
2002362510,532289,2018/12/10,1,"Awful, flavorless and gritty. Spent money on all the ingredients and will probably throw the entire thing out. The ramen noodles we buy at the grocery store take almost 6 hours to digest fully in your stomach so I was looking for a healthier alternative but this is definitely not it."
1801857308,496625,2014/1/12,5,Huge hit in my house! Substituted shallot for garlic and added slices of baby red potatoes.
47892,532738,2017/7/25,5,Fabulous employed as a wet rub (w/olive oil) for a spatchcock &amp; smoked whole chicken! I made a small batch for the chicken and for that reason substituted fresh mint from the garden. Whole spices in place of the cinnamon and cloves. Perfect!
2001654218,513419,2017/8/3,5,"This recipe truly is better than Le Madeline's! I made it and was blown away by how good it tasted and looked. I believe the recipe needs a minor alteration though. It says it makes two friands, but it really makes four. You must use BOTH of the puff pastry sheets and make four or you will have half of your chicken and sauce left over. This happened to me, and I had only thawed one sheet, so I had to take a chance and thaw the other one in the microwave. I didn't know what effect it would have on the final result, and happily it didn't effect it at all. All four friands looked beautiful. You will have extra sauce, which you should spoon over the tops of the finished friands, like Le Madeline's does. This is the best dish I have made in years. Awesome!! Oh yeah, don't think you can make this in 15 minutes. Not possible. Just making the mushrooms takes that long. Count on a minimum of 45 minutes to make this recipe."
2001772681,513419,2017/10/30,5,"This recipe is absolutely ridiculously delicious! We went to La Madeleine but didn't get the friand, which we regretted after seeing someone else get it. I went home and found this recipe. I am so glad I did! Having lived in France for several years, I can say this is a truly authentic French recipe. I did make 4 friands with this recipe, like the other reviewer did. Thank you for posting!"
2001974783,513419,2018/2/4,5,"Holy cow, this was excellent! halved the recipe and still came out fantastic. The mushroom sauce was actually better than La Madelein’s. More savory flavor. Thank you!!"
2597942,501470,2013/7/5,5,"I made these the other day. I was somewhat worried about the cresents not cooking thru, but they puffed up fine. I will warn that these are super sweet, I could only handle a couple bites. Hubby devoured the rest. I would recommend that you let them completely cool before glazing (mine kinda melted). I will probably use this technique again, but opt for a more &quot;savory&quot; filling for the crescents. Thank you for posting. (Made for Alphabet Soup tag)"
2819034,501470,2013/10/3,0,Really Tasty!!!
1802481684,501470,2014/2/12,0,Tried this quick recipe for some kid-friendly fun. Works great! I used Greek yogurt and drizzled sugar free caramel sauce on the top. These are now in dessert rotation.
280271,503133,2015/2/4,3,Both the hubby and I thought this was good...but the cumin was very overpowering...that&#039;s was the only flavor we tasted...because we enjoy the taste of shrimp we were a bit disappointed that it was on the back burner...the directions say to pour the mixture over the shrimp...there was nothing to pour...it was a paste after mixing all the ingredients together...even though this wasn&#039;t to our liking it was a pleasure to make...Made for &quot;FYC&quot; tag game...
865936,503164,2013/8/11,5,"I made this into individual little pie plates, so the topping came out sort of like a cookie!  I think kids will especially love this.  It is also a bit forgiving since I forgot the cinnamon, but was able to sprinkle it over top after cooking with the flavor still delicious!  Love the simplicity."
1052873,503451,2013/7/24,0,Made vegan style for ZWT9 Greek wedding challenge. Can&#039;t really review the recipe because of the alterations. Vegan doesn&#039;t work so well - you really need the eggs.
386585,495520,2013/8/6,5,"Delicious and easy (and colorful too)!  What more could you ask for?  I made this exactly as posted, though I have to say that my garlic did not smash up quite how I would have liked it to, so it really didn&#039;t form a proper paste.  However, the flavor was wonderful.  I used cube steaks, which is something I have not enjoyed in a long time.  Thanks for sharing.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
296809,495520,2013/8/8,5,"Made for the Goddesses of ZWT-9, as written &amp; using cube steaks. The meat was very flavorful &amp; nearly fork-tender. The marinating process was fun to watch &amp; I don&#039;t ever recall saying that. The combo of citrus fruits &amp; spicing apparently begins the cooking in the same manner as a ceviche. This is a colorful, tasty &amp; healthy dish that I served w/rice I stirred into the pan drippings w/the marinade. It gave the rice a lovely flavor &amp; light caramel color. We liked this a lot. Thx for sharing the recipe w/us."
228458,495520,2013/8/10,5,"I made this tonight for my meat-loving husband, who said it was quite delicious! It rates highly with me for being so easy to put together; I love that you can get fun, tropical flavor with everyday ingredients. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
1436160,512545,2014/5/7,5,This was such a wonderful and very speedy weeknight dinner.  It was perfect since we were eating at different times. I did not have any pear so I left that out. I also used more cheese.  Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
2001131324,516422,2017/9/1,0,"&acirc; &acirc; &acirc; How can you use only one 7 1/2 ounce bottle of hot fudge topping when your recipe calls for 8 oujnces (one cup) of hot chocolate sauce? Also, what are round chocolate wafers? Thanks! Sounds yummy!"
8629,517143,2015/10/3,5,These turned out terrific.  I got 12 very full cupcakes.
1271506,532472,2017/7/10,5,"I've been fixated with maf&eacute;s ever since a friend turned me on to a chicken version (which had come from a friend of a friend who had spent time in the Peace Corps in Niger) when I was in grad school. Since then, I've made maf&eacute;s with chicken, beef, and various vegetables. While this isn't my top favorite maf&eacute; recipe (I have two including the original chicken recipe that I learned), it's definitely delicious, with just the right amount of spice for our tastes. Thanks for posting!"
1801425446,511280,2013/12/27,0,"There is an obvious problem in the number of hours stated.  It takes cooking time four hours plus an additional two hours, but the header says four hours ten minutes total time."
2000831192,524993,2016/1/21,5,"I can&#039;t underestimate how fresh this sauce tasted.  For such few ingredients the flavor is very robust.  My family loved it.  When you cook it this way you also know every single ingredient in it. Extremely inexpensive.  Great for organic chefs.  
Yum-o"
661864,513288,2015/9/21,5,"lol, I&#039;ve been making these for many years. I have no idea where I got the recipe, and I&#039;ve never once seen it anywhere else. They&#039;re very good burgers, flavorful and tender. One of my favorites."
653438,506104,2013/8/25,5,Made for New Kids on the Block tag game and I am so glad I choose this recipe!  Delicious!  I followed the instructions and they turned out wonderful and DH could do or say anything but yummmmm.  I served this with recipe#223199#223199 and garlic sauteed spinach.  Needless to say we had a very tasty dinner.
480195,503116,2013/9/4,5,This is a terrific recipe. So simple and what flavor! DH is very fond of apricots and asked me to make it again the next day. This one&#039;s a keeper. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
169430,503116,2016/8/24,5,I can't imagine why I haven't made this lovely creation before. It's very easy and wonderfully yummy. I use a lot of yogurt and I can imagine this recipe being made with various fruits. I have some red plumbs in the bowl that would be excellent candidates. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 and a real keeper it is.
486725,503116,2016/9/10,5,"When I discovered the Quest recipes, this went into my list of the top three or four to make as soon as possible. It takes no time at all to put together, and is a satisfying light dessert. DH loves apricots, so this was right up our alley. One of the best parts is what is left on your plate when you are done - the juice that releases from the apricots mixes with the caramel and hint of lemon, which will leave you wanting to lick your plate!"
2324285,504892,2013/10/20,4,"The strawberry sauce really does make this recipe- delicious.  The lentil loaf itself did not have much flavor.  Some more seasoning would have helped.  It was still quite good with the sauce though.  I add some feta on top of the sauce, and served everything over feta-mint brown rice."
2597942,493219,2013/6/24,5,"I made this recipe to serve along side of Recipe # 465580, believing it would be good match. It probably would have been, if not for the fact the I destroyed the poor birdies! The corn however, turned out tasting fantastic! I only used 1 pepper (that&#039;s what I had left after using 3 on the hens). And I used frozen, but thawed, Green Giant corn on the cob, wrapped in foil. The butter was delicious. Thank you for posting this recipe. I will definately make it again with fresh sweet corn this summer."
280271,493219,2013/6/26,5,Yummy!...I cut the recipe in half...and the butter can serve at least twice the amount...so I have leftovers...for corn on the cob...maybe grilled bread...anyway...we loved it...I really tired to use my mini food processor to make everything smooth...but cutting the recipe in just didn&#039;t give enough ingredients to keep the processor mixing...but with that said...hubby and I like thinks on the chunky side...this is a keeper...thanks for posting it...=)
266635,493219,2015/5/9,5,Delicious and so flavorful.  I loved grilled corn and this tangy butter is wonderful slathered all over it.  Loved the subtle bite of the jalapeno. Will be made often -- all summer long.  : )
340141,504468,2013/7/31,3,"I tried this over cod and rice.   It was okay, but lacked some depth I would have liked (for example, from garlic).   I think I would have also preferred a 1:3 ratio of vinegar to coconut milk instead of 1:1.   I think it was a good basalmic vinegar; however, perhaps it was just a supermarket ripoff.   Zwt9"
107135,504468,2013/7/31,5,this would be good on pork .it has a nice flavor
37449,504468,2013/8/7,4,"I loved the balsamic vinegar, and thought I want more of that flavor, so maybe a little less of the coconut milk. This was so good with rice and beans, really woke up the flavors. Thanks!"
58104,501148,2013/6/21,3,Interesting!  I did make half the amount of the recipe using 3-4 cups pasta. 4 cups cooked pasta serves 4 not 6 so this is higher in calories then stated. But I found I need to add more pasta to the amount of veggies. As I read the directions I couldn&#039;t figure if this was a main dish salad to be eaten cold or a main dish pasta at room temperature? I wouldn&#039;t have enjoyed as a hot dish with some grated cheese on the pasta. If a salad it could have used some vinegar. As for the asparagus I snapped off the tough ends then sliced into 1/2 inch slices. Which I prefer to whole asparagus. Loved the basil and chives. Thanks.
2001725775,501148,2017/9/22,4,"I knew that was not enough pasta so I only used half the amount of pasta, then I add Zucchini which I made into pasta. I mixed them together. I needed more protein so I had three 7oz cans. that added 300 calories but since I used less pasta the calories count was about the same. Also, you need more garlic as per my family. It was good and we would make it again, next time we will add sesame oil and sesame seeds, no olive oil."
529278,498751,2014/11/16,5,Nice crisp coating for tilapia with good flavor. We used bigger filet pieces and cooked them a little longer to be more appropriate for that size and it worked great. We also used chili sauce instead of regular ketchup. 4 of the 5 members of our family don&#039;t particularly care for most fish but even the ones that aren&#039;t big fans ate this well.
1371234,498751,2016/10/21,4,Would add a little more of the spices to the fish as it's so mild you nearly can't taste it. With extra spices this recipe will likely get a solid B+ from me. Will definitely make again with some tweaks.
286566,495864,2013/4/30,5,"I scaled this back for 1 serve and used 2 large eggs and shared it with the DM and with toast it filled us both and we both loved this delicious and filling omelet, thank you ElizabethKnicely, made for Went to Market tag game."
1628095,517103,2017/4/2,5,"This was delicious and easy. Does not taste like a &quot;light&quot; PB pie at all! It was very sweet, so I may cut down on the sugar next time. This does great frozen for a chilly summer treat. Side note: the nutrition information is off for this recipe."
2001551988,517103,2017/5/24,3,"The calorie count on this in the nutrition is way off!! The crust alone is 100 cals per serving. After tweaking it by substiting fat free cream cheese, leaving out the crust and chocolate chips and subsisting the powdered sugar for a 1/4c of Stevia and 1/2 tsp of cornstarch it was still 104 cals. So if you make this and don't substitute anything I would plug it in to see what you are really getting."
169430,514023,2014/11/1,5,I made a half amount of the recipe using 2 eggs and got a really terrific bread pudding. My &quot;sample&quot; dish was really delicious still quite warm and the sauce is to die for. It&#039;s a dessert where a little goes a long way but you&#039;ll be oh so tempted to grab seconds as soon as the first serving is gone. The fresh peach addition is an excellent thought also. Made for For Your Consideration.
222564,533052,2017/8/13,5,"Sure is a real killer, with that certain voodoo about it! Not the tomato sauce kind of gumbo. Recipe for crock pot."
593927,493497,2013/1/18,5,"What a spicy and tasty tea we have here. I steeped red raspberry leaf tea bags by Traditional Medicinals (My go to tea since being pregnant) a long time in hot home made cashew milk to be dairy free along with cracked cardamom pods and organic cane sugar plus the powdered ginger, to taste.  Made for January 2013 ~ NA/ME Explores OMAN!"
163112,493497,2013/1/18,5,"This was absolutely wonderful on a cold, yukky day!  I used whole milk, cardamom pods, fresh ginger & loose rooibos.  Made for NA/ME Explores Oman 1/13."
1052873,493497,2013/2/7,4,"Just ok, but in fairness, probably would have been better if I used real milk rather than powdered. Cut recipe in 1/4 for one serving and used Earl Grey tea. Made for 2012 February Sun and Spice."
47892,493497,2013/3/27,5,I made two versions: the original (using whole milk) and for the second try I steeped the tea with boiling water and the spices then poured in a small amount of half and half. Either way was very good! I&#039;ve already enjoyed this tea everyday for the past several days! Made for NA*ME Tag/March.
169430,493497,2013/9/29,5,"I made a single wonderful cup for myself this noon. What a pleasure, I don&#039;t normally put milk in my tea but, of course Chai is an exception as it just wouldn&#039;t be chai otherwise. Used a small squish of ginger paste as I don&#039;t currently have any fresh. It all came together as a very nicely spiced, creamy cup of goodness. Made for NA/ME Tag, Sept 2013."
227120,501763,2013/7/3,0,"This sounds great (like a dish I get at a Thai restaurant call Panang Curry) but it seems you left out the peanut ingredients. Does it include peanut butter with the coconut milk whisk or fresh peanuts added in?  Thanks, I really want to try this."
2001886997,501763,2017/12/24,5,U forgot to stipulate how much lime juice.
1802961428,499396,2014/7/24,5,"I haven&#039;t actually tried this recipe and not sure if I want to but I am so happy it is here.  I grew up eating Pete&#039;s Famous Special Dogs and in my early adult life I worked right across the street in the Frank Nelson Building.  Needless to say I had a weekly dose of those Special Dogs for about 15 years while I worked at the firm.  I can&#039;t get my dogs to have that Pete&#039;s bite anyway, I think it was those special Zeigler hot dogs he used.  I might try this recipe later although I am glad someone is trying to preserve this wonderful delicious sauce recipe so others can enjoy it."
2001273251,520238,2017/4/17,0,"How do you grind the Onion and bacon? this was so good, I can't wait to make it again..."
2000769598,507595,2015/12/24,5,Delicious and easy to make.  Absolutely loved the combination of spices.
2000805150,507595,2016/1/7,5,"Super easy and very delicious veggie chili option! Even my meat eating brother loves it! I used more spices than recipe called for (more chili powder, cumin, cinnamon and added some coconut sugar 3tbsp) for extra seasoning. The lentils could have cooked/soaked more, but I&#039;m sure that will happen as it soaks overnight.
This was a yummy and healthy dinner for a chilly winter night."
2000829359,507595,2016/1/20,5,"The mouth feel and seasoning of this recipe kept us from missing the meat and even made the kidney beans edible!
A keeper!!"
1113755,507595,2016/3/15,5,"This is an excellent vegetarian Chili recipe!!! Quick and easy. I found it to be rather spicy, using 3t of Chili Powder, but mine may have just been an extra hot brand (Laxmi -- found it in the Eastern Indian aisle). Would honestly not alter a single thing other than the heat!! Yum!"
482933,505257,2013/8/12,5,"Love red and green veggies! Definitely delicious, dh and I ate half of it. I did not peel any of the tomatoes, cut onion into bite size pieces so it would be easy to spoon out. Used a tad more than 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Had in oven 65 minutes as onion was still crunchy at one hour mark before adding cheese. Thanks breezer for posting."
266635,505257,2014/8/6,5,"This is a really tasty veggie casserole.  Loved the addition of the croutons.  I had some zucchini that needed to be used up along with some home grown tomatoes.  I changed the recipe just a tiny bit -- I used petite diced tomatoes (drained) for layering in the casserole and then used my home grown tomatoes (sliced) on the top.  I left off the cheese at DH&#039;s request.  Sooo delicious!  Made for the Culinary Quest - U. S. Southern Region, August, 2014."
1052873,505257,2014/9/25,5,"This was a great way to use up some garden veggies. I used Stove Top stuffing for the croutons (chicken) and was in a hurry so cooked 20 minutes in the microwave, then melted the cheese. Made for CQ 14."
323186,505257,2015/1/29,5,"Such a simple and colourful veggie dish,  next time I would prefer to use larger zucchini as mine were little and didnt present so well, but taste wise,  perfect.   Really enjoyed this, thank you breezermom, this was made and enjoyed for International Agents of Quest,   USA Southern Region   Updated to add, made again, excellent :)  made my own garlic croutons this time"
2324285,493936,2013/2/18,5,"Mmmmm, I loved the dal, and the naan was some of the best I've ever made.  This deserves five stars for the naan alone- I will be making it a lot in the future!  Thanks for sharing."
318262,493936,2014/3/23,5,"I didn&#039;t make the naan but loved the dal! My Indian bf says its the best I&#039;ve made. However, we found we actually liked it better before the milk was added."
266635,493936,2015/1/30,5,"We loved this dal recipe very much -- it is sooo delicious over rice.  I had such a rushed day that I was unable to make the naan, but I promise to do so very soon as I will be making this dish again many times over.  Made for the Best of 2014 tag game."
125853,513907,2014/3/23,5,"Gotta love Rick Bayless.  If you can&#039;t get to Chicago to eat at Frontera or Topolabampo, this is the ticket!  Flavorful and moist!  There is a tendency to use boneless breasts when cooking chicken for convenience, but the taste of cooking chicken on the bone and whole takes it over the top. Everyone in the family loved it!"
296809,504212,2013/8/2,5,"Made as written for ZWT-9 &amp; a fellow Goddess, this recipe was reduced to 2 servings - BUT DH is not due home from a fishing trip until tomorrow night &amp; his portion may disappear. Most people have a love or hate relationship w/herring, but this salad is so good that it could turn haters into lovers. I esp liked the veggie mix I had never eaten w/herring before &amp; the sweetness the sugar added. Every piece of the recipe works to its advantage. Do not skip the chill time as it does enhance the flavors &amp; I suggest draining the liquid from the salad prior to serving. Thx for sharing this sure-to-be-repeated recipe w/us. Yum!."
67728,504212,2013/8/11,5,"My maternal grandfather got me hooked on pickled herring when I was a kid, so I wasn&#039;t surprised that I enjoyed this. The veggies were a perfect complement to the fish. I agree with twissis about draining the salad before serving, because there&#039;s quite a bit of liquid. I&#039;ll definitely be making this again when I have a craving for pickled herring. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9"
4439,504212,2014/3/12,5,I am making this for Pammyowl&#039;s cookathon. I was very sad to hear about her passing. &lt;br/&gt;This recipe is very delicious and tastes like something my German mother would have made. I will continue to use the recipe and will think of Pam when I do.
480195,504103,2013/8/24,5,These potato cakes are delicious and very flavorful. I served them with a roast chicken and everyone gobbled them up. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
107135,504103,2013/8/24,5,i just grated  it all together  and fried  tastes good zwt9
695933,494625,2013/10/17,4,"Pizza is always such a great way to eat your veggies! And I can have this for breakfast.&lt;br/&gt;We had this For lunch today, Yes I did made a few alterations, I can&#039;t leave anything alone! I have to play with my food. I did adjusted to my personal taste. I think I would like to add some herbs to the mix and 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese  for my tastes and would definately like to make again. I did use thin pita bread, To me this is a recipe in which the ingredients could be added or taken from to satisfy indiviudal taste. Next time I may use Applewood smoked bacon, cremini mushrooms, asparagus, and Asiago cheese all come together on a thin, crunchy flat bread to create a hearty and delicious main. Preparation may take some time, but the finished product is well worth every second. Serve alongside a fresh green salad for nice balance. Thanks for sharing PRMR 2013..... Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to y&#039;all !  Grpa"
804550,510535,2014/1/5,5,"Very tasty! When I tagged this recipe I intended to cook it in my tangine however, i ended up using my crock pot instead. I browned six chicken thighs and dusted them with sweet Hungarian paprika. Then I combined the rest of the ingredients into the crock pot cooked it for 8 hours on low. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Made for Winter NAME tag."
47892,510535,2014/1/13,4,This was a winner and very easy to prepare. I cooked the chicken on stove top. The eggplant was omitted (we hate it-to be quite honest) and I usually would sub a zucchini but I used a little bit of red and orange bell pepper. Something for me seemed incomplete with this recipe-so I added about 1/2 teaspoon of ras el hanout when I browned the chicken breasts in the butter. I also used a combination of smoked paprika and sweet paprika. The last 10 minutes of cooking the lid was removed and the heat increased to medium-low to thicken the sauce. The sauce was delicious over Recipe #335255. Garnished with fresh cilantro and parsley. Made for Winter NA*ME Tag game. Come play!
163112,510535,2014/2/19,5,"Darn, I made this awhile ago!  Absolutely fantastic!  I did use boneless boobs, so I didn&#039;t simmer for 30 minutes.  Delicious!!"

2698687,497450,2013/3/14,5,I tried this dish for  breakfast this morning and it was delicious. I put salsa on my eggs and it complimented the potatoes well. I would love to try this dish for dinner with sour cream and green onions.
2690702,497450,2013/3/14,5,"I have made this before for my mom and I for breakfast. I just used regular sausage and cheddar cheese instead, and I also made Eggs Ranchero.It came out delicious! cant wait to try this version... Thanks Jaylin :-))"

2749639,497450,2013/3/23,5,I never thought to use chorizo like this but after trying it I will continue to use chorizo more often. The cheese in this dish added extra flavor and I didn&#039;t need any seasonings. Good Job Chef!
2749663,497450,2013/3/23,5,Easy and Delicious! Chorizo has so much flavor and really helps bring the dish to life. And I love potatoes...I&#039;m a regular home chef now!

2755988,497450,2013/3/26,0,Simply Potatoes is already my favorite brand of potatoes so to add the chorizo and cheese made them even more enjoyable.  Great for a quick meal or snack.
2344755,497450,2013/8/10,0,"Quick meal! Fantastic taste. My husband, three year old and 16 month old love this. Enjoy it with a side of scrambled eggs."
2000569894,528120,2017/4/11,5,This is the best chicken casserole I have ever had in my life! I have made this one several times and eat nearly half of the pan the first night. The rest is usually gone the next day. Delicious.
251917,503150,2014/2/25,5,Aussie Swap #85: Outstanding savory treats! I made these alongside a nice salad and they were delicious!
2001229688,526222,2016/11/2,5,"Followed exactly and my 1&quot; filet came out perfectly medium-rare and tasted great. No need to pull out a thermometer. I don't usually pour wine in at the final stage, but this worked :)"
2829886,526222,2017/4/23,5,This is the ONLY way to cook a filet - I just had to make an adjustment as my filets were a little less than 1 inch thick. So easy and so flavorful! We will never grill a filet again!!
2001727662,526222,2017/9/24,5,It was delicious!!!!
2001991784,526222,2018/3/22,5,"This is my go-to recipe for filet mignon. It's perfect. I heat my cast iron to 450&deg;F, measured with an infrared thermometer. Note that it's important to choose a drinkable wine to get quality results."

386585,504019,2013/8/20,5,"This was really very good, although my potatoes did not mash up quite as much as directed.  However, we liked them a little chunkier.  The harissa gives this a nice kick, but not too much.  I ended up using 6 eggs, though, to have more egg than potato.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
280271,511384,2014/12/30,5,This was surprisingly delicious...I wasn&#039;t to sure how mustard and orange would work together...this had a nice sweet taste with a lingering tang from the mustard...I had a larger tenderloin so it did need additional time in the oven...made for For Your Consideration tag game...=)
37449,503342,2013/7/31,4,Nice little snack. I used creamy peanut butter and made 2 prunes. Made for ZWT#9 2013 by a fellow team member of Hot Stuff!
266635,517431,2014/8/12,5,"We enjoyed this dish very much.  Loved the combination of the tartness of the vinegar and the sweetness of the apples and applesauce.  It makes such a nice presentation as well.  Served this tonight with a sour cream green bean dish and rotisserie chicken.  Made for Culinary Quest - U. S. Southern Region, August, 2014."
1745502,522941,2015/7/31,5,"Refreshing! I used fresh cherries, since that&#039;s what I had on hand. It looks very pretty and doesn&#039;t taste too sweet."
482376,522941,2015/8/27,5,This is so refreshing and delicious. I love it. I used some of the defrosted juice along with the cherries. This is a fun way to enjoy sake. Yum! Made for CQ2 - Family Picks - Japan
314579,522941,2016/7/19,5,(Stacy G posting for CQ 2016 Japan!) This was the first recipe I made for our Culinary Quest 2016! It was fabulous! I buy sake for cooking and always seem to throw most of the bottle away. NO MORE!! I'll just drink it up using this recipe! I used ginger beer soda and some amazing cocktail Bing cherries (with the cherry juice). Loved this. Refreshing with just a little kick. I've had one of these every night for the last week. Thanks for posting and starting off my tour the right way!
1925885,522941,2016/8/29,5,"I made this after seeing it chosen as Best of Quest. Wow - this is fabulous! I didn't even know there was such a thing as frozen cherries. So in addition to an amazing cocktail, those frozen cherries are great for nibbling! Thanks for posting!"
695933,506224,2013/12/8,5,"I made this a party, HUGE hit! everyone drank all I had mixed and still wanted more! A definite staple on my holiday list!     PRMR 2013....Grpa"
2000794713,529558,2018/11/29,5,"I made this for the first time last year. It was a hit with everyone. People who hate fruitcake love this. I called it Christmas cake, lol. It disappeared so quickly, that this year I made two. The hardest part is waiting to eat it while it soaks up all that lovely bourbon."
58104,496210,2013/4/2,5,Easy this is. I used my tomatoes from the garden that I jarred. Thanks
2754724,496769,2013/3/26,0,This was a great tasty and easy recipe.I used haddock because that&#039;s what is easy to get in my area but I would use this recipe with any fish. I made my own brushetta the day before.
496803,502868,2013/7/14,4,"This is really good!  I make all of my own salad dressings and will definitely add this one to the rotation.  The herbs are what really make this special- the oregano is the first flavor that hits my tongue, followed by the basil.  It was very easy to scale down to a home-sized quantity as well; I converted the oil and vinegar amounts to ounces and and the rest of the ingredients to tablespoons, then divided everything by 6 to get the amount that I needed (I don&#039;t trust the recipe converter here, sorry). The only thing that kept this from being 5 stars in my book is that it is a little thin- more vinegar than oil instead of the other way around.  I&#039;ll add a bit more oil the next time I make it to get a consistency I like better.  Made for Team Hot Stuff for ZWT9."
2177426,495405,2017/7/18,5,"Made exactly as written. This is a lovely, light, and very flavorful soup! Thank you"
169430,508204,2014/3/25,5,I made this  potato salad for my loving neighbor who raved about it and ask for the recipe. My neighbor has been ill and is now feeling much better but still weak so I&#039;ve been helping a bit. She said that the sweet/sour aspect was right on point and that she will be making a big batch for their first BBQ of the coming season. Thanks for sharing your recipe threeovens. :D
2549237,499114,2013/5/2,5,"This soup is GREAT!  I doubled this and didn&#039;t cut the broccoli because I was too tired and lazy, but followed everything else exactly.  This soup was so comforting after a long, long day of working.  Thanks for a definite keep CaliforniaJan.  Made for Photo Tag Spring 2013."
237123,495946,2013/2/26,5,"So delicious!  I love roasted cauliflower and I love cumin, but never tried them togther.  I made a vegan version of the sauce by whipping up a cashew aioli and adding an already prepared harissa.  Yummy, easy and healthy- you can't beat that.  Thanks for posting, we'll be eating this again for sure."
482376,495946,2013/8/22,5,Yummy! I absolutely love roasted cauliflower and the directions for this were perfect. I really loved the harissa sauce addition. Great for dipping! Thank you. Made for the Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9
163112,504179,2013/8/8,5,"OOOOOH BABY!!!  I made 6 eggs so there&#039;d be an even amount to share between the 3 of us,  I used all mayo &amp; did include preserved lemon.  All that &amp; it was mildly seasoned.  I should say perfectly seasoned.  I was expecting it to be zippier.  Maybe because I used 1 extra egg?  These were just so gosh darned good!  Thank you!  Made for NA/ME Tag."
305531,504179,2013/8/20,5,"Yum. These were tasty. I used homemade harissa and preserved lemon for these. I didn&#039;t notice until we ate about half of them, but all of my garnishments were still sitting on the counter. The rest of the eggs had lots of garnishes. lol. Thanks for sharing, Cookgirl. Made for ZWT9."
852554,504179,2013/8/20,5,"Yum!  Used recipe #424892 for the Harissa.  I used mayo, just sweet paprika (since I had hot in my harissa), parsley, and forgot the nuts (whoopsie!) - such a fun way to change up devilled eggs, especially since I always have hard boiled eggs on hand! Made for ZWT 9."
539686,504179,2013/8/20,5,"I agree with my fellow Hottie, Cadillacgirl this is a five star recipe. I used store bought harissa and almonds and chives on top...This is a very tasty and in my opinion, superior deviled egg over my standard mayo and relish. Made for ZWT 9 and jumping into my Best of Cookbook!!"
174096,504179,2013/8/22,5,"Yum, these are great!  I prepared some homemade harissa and preserved lemon.  The flavors came together well - very enjoyable.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
328048,504179,2013/8/24,0,"I don&#039;t feel fair rating this, cause I think I must have messed up the proportions some how. Mine look very red not pale like the ones in the picture. Also, the flavor is not what I was expecting. The harissa seems almost muted. I think maybe I put in too much paprika or something. I&#039;ll try them again sometime, cause I think they could be very good."
383346,504179,2013/8/25,5,These are so yummy and spicy.  It&#039;s great with the preserved lemon.  Thanks Cookgirl :)  Made for ZWT9
452355,504179,2013/8/25,5,"Great departure from the traditional deviled egg recipe (which I also love).  Nice presence of heat, with a hint of smoke from the smoked paprika.  I used preserved lemon and just a tiny bit of salt.  I used store bought Harissa.  For the garnish, I used cilantro, pine nuts and the optional caraway.  Very good!  Made for ZWT9"
169430,504179,2013/10/10,5,"Mmmm, munch, mmmm, munch, munch. Extremely tasty eggs that you have here CG. I didn&#039;t opt for the caraway (this time) but everything else went on and on, LOL. Made for NA/ME Tag."
128473,504179,2015/6/25,5,"Loved, loved these eggs.  Wow, what flavor.  I used homemade harissa, so happy that I did. They were awesome.  I loved that you could taste so many different flavors and textures.  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  I couldn&#039;t find preserved lemons so I used fresh lemon juice as recommended. I garnished these masterpieces with cilantro, toasted pine nuts and caraway seeds.  Thank you for sharing this recipe that I have placed in my Favorites for 2015. Kudos to you. Made FYC 2015"

2597942,505979,2013/11/7,5,"This is a super simple recipe. It is how I normally make strawberry shortcake, but never considered adding raspberries with it. I had a bunch frozen from summer and thought what a great way to use some up. I used the little individual short cake cups. Hubby and I enjoyed these very much. Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
2001281144,529300,2016/12/4,5,Perfect

1800293755,495697,2013/11/26,5,"I made this cornbread yesterday and it definitely beats the pants off my old recipe! This bread is pleasingly sweet without being too sweet.  Also, the texture is very nice--it&#039;s just right! Although the recipe doesn&#039;t specify, use unsalted butter and it will come out perfect.  Oh and by &quot;canned&quot; milk, the author of the recipe means evaporated milk, by the way, not condensed (I asked). Anyway, this is my new favorite cornbread recipe!  I can&#039;t wait til tomorrow morning so I can have another slice, warmed in the microwave, topped with butter. Yumm!!"
91584,495697,2014/3/31,5,CORNBREAD PERFECTION! Over the top good- thanks so much  :)
383563,495697,2014/12/23,0,"I made this tonight and it turned out amazing (I posted my pic!).  I chose to use the cream-style corn instead of the butter and/or olive oil and instead of using an additional 1/4 cup of corn, I added a 1/4 cup of cream-style corn.  Thank you for posting."
2000441383,495697,2015/8/31,3,I found this to be very wet in my breadmaker.  I had to try to finish baking it in the oven.  It tasted very good once it was coked all the way.  I would recommend altering this recipe some.
1287956,517962,2014/8/25,4,"This was really good, but I had to use old-fashioned dinner rolls; also, need to cut the meat portion in half (or double the rolls) because it was too much to use for this recipe -- but now I&#039;ll have a great meatloaf!"
2009447,496606,2013/10/8,5,We love this recipe so much!  In fact I was going to go online to post it and realized it was already on here.  You can also sub honey for corn syrup to make it more healthy!

1803648383,496606,2016/4/23,5,"This isn&#039;t so much a review, since I haven&#039;t made it yet, as a question.
The list of ingredients calls for white chips or white almond bark. 
It is not included in the recipe.  You can see them in the picture.
My question - are they added the last ten minutes to let them melt  OR
                          do you melt them and then drizzle it on?

I gave it 5 stars because I just know this is going to be delicious!!"
1802485165,496606,2016/4/24,1,Ditto what Lisa F says - it doesn&#039;t tell you about the &quot;icing&quot; or white bark as shown in the photo . . .

1802910226,532088,2017/10/28,5,sweet potato soup was so very good. I loved the leeks fried on top.
2000571571,535782,2018/7/8,0,You forgot to mention how many Kit Kat bars needed for this recipe..also why do you always put tools or ingredients in a recipe that most people don't have in their kitchen ie..an ice cream pan??? really??? I'll improvise using my spring foam pan.
1680722,494132,2013/7/16,5,"I made this with fresh juice of Cretan oranges!&lt;br/&gt;This is a wonderful recipe, especially if you have good quality ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;I love the combination with cardamom as this is one of my favorites spices.&lt;br/&gt;Great on vanilla ice-cream!"
128473,494132,2014/1/8,5,"OMG Mikekey, this was amazing.  The absolute best tasting syrup that I`ve ever tried.  This was wonderful, I loved the combination of orange and cardamom.  So quick and easy to make with terrific results.  Simply, perfect served with buttermilk pancakes.  Thanks for sharing a recipe that I have placed in my Best of Cookbook for 2013.  Update:  I have made this 4 times now using Cara Cara oranges, its just as great each time.  Its wonderful mixed with olive oil over salad and my new favorite way to enjoy this lovely syrup is with club soda, it makes an awesome soda.  Thanks again my friend, Kudos to you."
2002155616,525932,2018/5/17,0,"I really need somebody to explain &quot;ground roasted rice&quot; to me. Am I supposed to take cooked rice and spread it in a pan and put it under the broiler? Do you toast it in a frying pan raw and then cook it, or boil it and then toast it in a frying pan? Do you grind it raw or grind it cooked? Help!"

1802892051,517658,2014/8/9,5,This might be my new favorite cucumber salad!  I also did not peel my cukes because they were nice little kirby cukes.  I&#039;ll make this often.  Made for my teammate on the Cruisin&#039; Culinary Queens for the Culinary Quest 2014.  xo Bethie
174096,517658,2014/8/10,5,"This is great. It is so simple and easy to throw together, and the lemon dill dressing really makes it pop. Great to make and then stick in the fridge while pulling the rest of the meal together. Thanks for sharing! Made for Culinary Quest &#039;14."
542159,517658,2014/8/10,5,We loved this easy and very tasty salad! I did let it chill about two hours before serving. I did not take a photo as I used regular cucumbers and thought the photo with the lemon cucumbers was such a good fit for the recipe. Thanks for the yummy post.
157425,517658,2014/8/15,5,I used english cucumbers with olive oil and enjoyed a very good cucumber salad. The lemon and dill added fresh flavors. Another keeper from out team! Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest event 2014 - Cruisin Culinary Queens.
80353,517658,2014/9/15,4,Easy and tasty.  Used an English seedless cucumber.
2001031194,507001,2016/5/30,4,"Has a spicy kick to it. I followed the recipe with a few subs i.e. used swedish vegetarian meatballs from Ikea, Soyrizo and it tasted good, though the spicyness may mask the flavor. Maybe I should have used some of the ingredients from the meatballs, for example the cilantro, onions and spices to impart more flavor. Overall, a very good recipe."
37449,514163,2014/3/18,0,"I had to try this because I just couldn&#039;t quite imagine how it would taste. The peanut butter was prominent, with a bite of onion. It was interesting and different. May not make it again, but had to try it. Thanks! I don&#039;t know how to rate the recipe so won&#039;t leave stars."
315565,502816,2013/8/15,5,Great healthy meal or side and quick to whip up after work ! I used white cabbage instead of red and served it with chilli sauce. Made for ZWT9.
80353,502949,2013/7/18,5,"Very fast to throw together, and a healthier option to regular nachos.  Do eat them fast as they can get soggy with all the wet toppings.  My &#039;guys&#039; loved these and have requested I make them again very soon."
114027,502949,2013/7/27,5,"I don&#039;t know what it is about nachos but I just can&#039;t get enough of them and this was a super fun and different way to serve them up! I really enjoyed the honey in this besides just the great combination of flavors. Made for the Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT9."

2001926753,528225,2018/1/21,0,I used Hubbard squash instead of pumpkin. Made this in custard cups and it is wonderful!
482376,502797,2013/8/8,5,Fabulous!! I&#039;m putting these pancakes into my best-of-the-best file. Simple and delicious. I really loved the spelt flour! The blueberries are always a nice addition. Thank you for posting this gem. Made for the Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9.
314579,502797,2017/9/6,4,"This was a quick and easy recipe! I think you could easily add anther 1/2 or more of blueberries. The blueberries are the star in this recipe as there is no sugar in the batter, but a little syrup sweetened them right up. Thanks for posting dear Linky! Made for CQ 2017, Scandinavia."
895132,500440,2013/8/23,5,"We were both raving about this dish! Accidentally, I forgot to add the spinach, but I think it didn&#039;t really affect the taste.

1363685,500282,2013/12/1,0,"Pointers:  &lt;br/&gt;1.  Use a 4 qt slow cooker; (2 1/2 qt is NOT &quot;close enough&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;2.  Use a slow cooker liner!!  ALWAYS!!&lt;br/&gt;3.  Set aside the flour mixture in step 2.  I used the mixing bowl and added the butter and &lt;br/&gt;     sweet potato to it all at once so when it came to &quot;gradually beat in the flour mixture&quot;, it &lt;br/&gt;     was too late!!  &lt;br/&gt;4.  Microwave the dulce de leche to make it &#039;spreadable&#039;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I only followed #2 and it was a disaster, but I&#039;m willing to give it a try again!!"

280271,512444,2014/4/7,5,I&#039;m giving these a five star because of the spicy flavor...I think I would call these wedges instead of fries...with that said...I cooked my wedges (with skins on) for 45 minutes and they were done but not crispy...so either I would suggest you throw them under the broiler for a few minutes or cut them thinner...into fries...but the flavor of these hit my spicy pallet...thanks for posting the recipe...made for Spring 2014 PAC...=)
2001957846,517006,2018/1/28,5,I added kalamata olives and shaved parmesan with a touch of garlic powder. It turned out awesome! Thanks for the easiest bread recipe ever!
323186,496776,2013/4/4,5,"We really enjoyed this more unusual curry,  I particularly liked the sweet potato, love sweet potato in curry and enjoyed the bright color!   I used ground chicken, since that was what the supermarket had.   As with most curries, flavours blend and improve over time, my DH had plenty left for lunch the next day and pronounced it excellent.  I served this over rice, like my rice, and also made it go further!   Another winner, rp, made for PRMR tag game"
498271,496776,2014/2/5,5,"This is a wonderful and easy to make curry!  You took the rather tame flavors of ground turkey and sweet potatoes and really elevated them with all those spices.  I used a jalapeno instead of the serrano as that&#039;s what I had on hand.  The peas were a great addition to this too and you&#039;re right - it&#039;s very hearty, no rice needed ;)  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
2001275315,496776,2016/11/29,5,What a fantastic combination! I did JUST as you said but stuck it all in a crock pot... 5 hours later PERFECTION! The next time I do this I will throw in some chopped Pineapple. I will do this simply because it was VERY well complimented with Mango Chutney... Pineapple is a nice substitute for that.
2001588133,496776,2017/7/13,0,I made this and it was delicious I loved the way it turned out and very simple to make and I would make it again
199848,505584,2013/8/13,5,"Fantastic salad!  It&#039;s very fresh, crisp and colorful.  I like that it is something different to make with tuna (I used the albacore tuna in the pouch).  I used fresh mint in place of dried and I think that is the way to go.  Great summer food.  Thanx for posting!"
1334806,505584,2013/8/24,5,"Tasty salad!  I added more vinegar and extra seasoning to make the salad a little more zippy, but other than that, it was fresh, crisp and delicious!  Made for ZWT 9."
1436160,511832,2014/4/23,4,"This was good comfort food. There is a lot of sodium in the recipe, but I did use reduced sodium soy sauce, brown gravy mix, and cream of mushroom soup. We did not feel the end result was too salty. The instructions did not include the minced garlic, so I sauteed it with the onion and carrots. I was concerned that I should have reduced the amount of water, but after cooking an additional 5 minutes with the lid off the excess liquid was absorbed. Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014."
482376,498344,2014/5/6,5,"This is a seriously delicious salad! It is going into my best-of-the-best file. I LOVE the strawberry dressing and also appreciate that it is healthy. The toasted walnuts, red onion, strawberries, avocado combination is outstanding. Such a beautiful, healthy and totally delicious salad. Company worthy! I skipped the goat cheese (personal preference) and replaced it with feta - although it&#039;s good without any cheese. Made for the 2014 Spring Pick-A-Chef event in the contest and event forum."
128473,498344,2015/2/5,5,"Wow, we loved this wonderful strawberry salad.  It was so quick and easy to make with ingredients almost always found in pantry and fridge.  It was very flavorful and had great textures.  Made as written but used fig goat cheese and candied almonds (it was what I had on hand). I used a mixture of baby arugula and spinach for the greens.  I really enjoyed the way the avocado paired so beautifully with the strawberries.  The dressing was simply delish, I used a white balsamic because my dh is picky and doesn&#039;t like the red.  You can taste the love in this salad .  I will be adding it on my Valentines Day menu.  Made for Best of 2014 Tag Game.  Kudos on Making it into my Best of 2015 Cookbook.  Thank you so much for sharing."
340141,506303,2013/11/3,4,"Very good burger.   I used Kalamata olives; however, this is one case where I think it might have been better to use a milder black olive."
169430,506303,2015/1/21,5,"I used regular black olives and thoroughly enjoyed this burger.  Lots of flavor and very tummy satisfying. Sometimes nothing will do but a good cheese burger and I loved this one with a mixed salad, :D"
128473,500130,2013/6/24,5,"Wow, what a terrific hot chocolate Sharon.  I made it three times last week.  It was wet, grey and dreary all week, this was a perfect way to brighten up the day.  The hot chocolate was awesome. Rich, thick and creamy.  I especially enjoyed the toasted marshmallows, so yummy.  Do watch them when under the broiler, they burn quickly.  I used pink and white marshmallows as that is what I had in the house.  Thanks for sharing your tasty recipe."
135470,500130,2013/7/6,3,"I was torn with this one - the hot chocolate was tasty with the graham cracker crumbs and the marshmallows but I found but not so much more than regular hot chocolate to have to deal with the mess and the difficulty of trying to get the marshmallow and crumbs to stick. Also after broiling the handle wasn&#039;t too hot but the lip of the mug beneath the crumbs was, to the point I wouldn&#039;t serve this to a child. I might try this with marshmallow cream and see if it works any easier. Made for PRMRT"

488441,495332,2013/3/4,5,Five stars for the cupcake but I don't think that the cocoa was a great addition to the frosting. I think the bacon and maple would have been fine without the chocolate. Creative use of bacon and maple syrup! Like it!
37449,501453,2014/5/6,5,"Yum! I did change it a little with ingredient on hand. I used some leftover chickpea salad for the hummus and some homemade pickles for the cucumber. Loved it with flatbread. Thanks! Made for PAC, spring 2014."
1802696984,513047,2014/4/25,5,great green sauce exactly what I was looking for no tomatillos
1802805807,513047,2014/6/8,5,This is the most addictive substance known to man. I use to buy it by the quart and bring it back to Mississippi with me.
1179225,513047,2014/6/19,5,"Delicious! Spicy, but not too hot. I halved the recipe and when I was cooking the jalapenos the water evaporated enough to singed them, but it actually added nice toasted flavor to the jalapenos. I loved the simplicity of this recipe and the only thing I would do different next time would be to use maybe half a bouillon cube, to reduce the saltiness. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!"
2000320670,513047,2015/7/6,5,Tasted exactly like the green sauce at Taqueria Arandas! Made it for a family bbq and got compliments all day!
2001178634,513047,2016/9/22,0,This was exactly what I was trying to find a recipe for! I wanted to reproduce the squeeze bottle green sauce at Michoacana or Taqueria Arandas. This does it.
2000256563,513047,2017/4/29,5,It tasted exactly like the one at taqueria arandas! Thank you for this recipe!!
895132,495332,2013/3/15,5,"Moist and yummy, perfect balance of sweet and a little salty. I used my own home made gluten free cake mix, and it turned out delicious. I&#039;ve had this kind of topping without cocoa before and have to say that to me, the cocoa made quite a difference. It tasted delectably chocolatey, wouldn&#039;t make it any different next time.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing!"
2597942,495332,2013/5/22,0,"I made these yesterday morning (or I should say that I &quot;tried&quot;  to make these). I did not post any stars because I know it will not change the rating. I&#039;m sure it was my own fault that these failed. I do not have use of my gas oven right now, so I attempted these in a 6 cupcake pan in my electric toaster oven.  They did not cook properly. I have the remaining batter and topping in my fridge. I made these, per instructions (although I omitted the ketchup, even tho I knew that was in the list of ingredients you had to work with), and the batter tasted great (I know, you&#039;re not suppose to eat raw batter, but who doesn&#039;t lick the beaters?) I made the topping as directed, but divided it, and only used cocoa powder in half of it. I tasted both before putting on top of the batter. I liked them both. The finished product did not bake up correctly. I will try these again when my real oven is working again. Thank you for posting your recipe. (Made for. PRMR)"
114027,503600,2013/7/27,4,"This was a nice simple recipe to throw togther in the morning and cook in the evening. The meat turned out very tender and juicey. I served it with recipe#472507.  I did have a slightly bitter flavor, but it was most likely something I did to it. Made for The Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT 9."

2124638,499338,2013/11/4,5,I got this from Pinterest and tried it! Fabulous!  Thanks for posting her for another quick go to.  Nice and easy recipe with fantastic results!  One our holiday favorites!
1802502810,499338,2014/2/18,2,"I baked mine at 325.  It&#039;s a good cake if you are craving something sweet and have limited ingredients in the house and no money to buy a package of cookies,  I guess.  It takes a long time to bake, and at least overnight to chill and I&#039;m hoping it tastes better cold.  I haven&#039;t chilled mine completely yet, but just had to take a small square to see how the layers turned out.  I have three distinct layers - the custard and almost angel food sponge cake are about the same thickness, almost an inch, with a very thin dense bottom layer.  The custard is very eggy, the top, like I said is almost like angel food.  I&#039;m not blown away by it.  I might make it again and keep a closer eye on the time as my kid was making popcorn in the kitchen and I never heard the timer go off after 45 minutes. When I did take it out, the cake was tall, standing well over the edge of the 8x8 pan, and golden, but fell about an inch as it cooled.  So, maybe it was over-baked.  It&#039;s just not thrilling."
8671968,499338,2014/2/18,0,This recipe doesn&#039;t tell you the temperature to bake it at. I&#039;m trying 325 degrees from another recipe. I hope it works!
2001683867,518331,2017/9/17,0,"Terrible, so dry and I didn't even cook it for 8 hrs. Would not make it again."
2597942,497633,2013/4/30,5,"YUM! We made these for dinner (since we had another nice day for grilling out). I&#039;m so happy to have tried this. This is very different from your plain ol&#039; BBQ chicken or Buffalo style chicken. I did have to make a couple alterations, but nothing that really changed the recipe itself. I used legs (drumsticks) instead of wings, since that is what we had on hand  (although I will make this again with wings). I had pre-toasted sesame seeds, so I got to skip that part. Also, I used just a pinch of dried ginger to replace the fresh. We loved this variation on chicken (and we make chicken quite often). Thank you for posting this recipe. (Made for PRMR - Spring 2013). P.S. I believe it took close to 40 minutes to cook the legs thru."
482376,497633,2013/8/22,5,"Excellent wings! We all gobbled these little gems up quickly. I love the Asian flavors and the extra touch of the toasted sesame seeds. The recipe is a breeze to prepare, too. Thanks for posting! Made for the Soup-A-Stars of ZWT9"
80353,497633,2013/8/23,5,"Lip-smacking good wings!  The glaze is delicious, incorporating savoury and hot.  I added just a touch of sweet with a drizzle of honey (my kids love that element).  A definite keeper."
174096,497633,2013/8/26,5,"Delicious!  The glaze is so flavorful, and I loved making the wings on the grill - they crisped up nicely.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
1803120738,497633,2014/9/9,5,"Thanks for posting this. Got this from my Weber cook book years ago then lost the cook book when I moved back to my hometown. Have searched all over the web, in cook books( didn&#039;t remember it was the Weber book), and old Men&#039;s Health Mags(thought that was where I had found it). Finally found it again thanks to you. My family &amp; friends will all be very happy!"
895132,502617,2015/9/5,5,"We loved this!! I made my own tortillas which was a bit messy, but tasted great. Thanks for sharing!
Made for Culinary Quest 2015 / Tex-Mex"
50509,502617,2018/6/21,5,"Tasty and easy. My oven is out, so I threw the tortillas on the gas burner to toast one side, then flipped onto a comal and topped with the other ingredients. I used a poached egg, because I could do that in the egg cooker. I'm going to try this with refried beans, too."
1762637,506925,2013/9/25,1,I didn&#039;t care for this at all. I thought the onion soup mix gave it an odd taste when combined with mayonnaise.
855913,506925,2013/10/22,5,"The first time I made this I used the vegetable dry soup mix and it was DELICIOUS! In fact it was so good that I made it a week later since I was having a group of friends over for dinner. This time I used the onion soup mix and it too, received rave reviews. We served ours the first time over mashed potatoes and the second time over a bed of rice. Both made good use of the sauce. Thanks for sharing! *I don&#039;t know what brand of onion soup mix the last reviewer used, but I used Lipton Onion Soup mix and the recipe turned out really great, but I have noticed that some onion soup mixes can be a little over powering and over salty, which is why I always use the Lipton brand."
1803745163,520603,2015/2/4,5,"I LOVE these, so much so that I created a food.com account just so I could review them.  A great recipe if you&#039;re trying to go more toward home-made, natural snacks and away from store-bought, processed.  They&#039;re great as is, however after making them according to the recipe the first couple times, I tried the following adjustments and think the result was an even yummier and more energy-packed bar.  For the whole wheat flour, I subbed 1/2 c coconut flour and 1/2 c cashew meal (you could probably use any nut meal/flour, as this recipe is pretty forgiving).   I reduced the maple syrup to 1/4 c and added 1/4 c honey.  I used 1 cup quick oats and 1/2 c steel cut oats.  I added roughly 1/3 c raisins.  And any hearty, earthy/grainy cereal will work (in place of the raisin bran.  If the mixture is too dry at the end (i.e. crumbly v. spreadable), you can add a bit more pumpkin or up to 1/4 c water as the recipe indicates.  So good!"
266635,497564,2013/4/5,5,Delicious mushrooms!  The garlic just takes these mushrooms over the top.  I left out the olive oil and just used butter (my preference; although less healthy).  They were sooo good.  Great addition to a grilled steak or any grilled meat.  Made for the PRMR tag.
539686,497564,2013/4/23,5,"These are such a great side dish and very easy to make. I did use a little more wine and it worked just fine. Thanks for posting, we&#039;ll have these often."
2585084,497564,2013/4/28,5,This was a simple and tasty side dish.  I will be sure to prepare it again.  I sliced larger mushrooms and they did fine.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

227978,497564,2014/2/18,5,"This was a fabulous recipe, Boomette.  I really enjoyed it.  I completely forgot to sprinkle the lemon juice and parsley on tap before serving, but they were delicious nonetheless.  I&#039;ll make this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing it with us."
199848,497564,2014/2/22,5,Wonderful mushrooms!    They were red wine reduced very nicely into a nice garlicky glaze.  The fresh lemon juice and fresh parsley really make the recipe; don&#039;t skip either!   Thanx for sharing!
1412985,497564,2017/6/17,5,Very good!
323186,506597,2014/12/17,5,"I&#039;m not always the best baker but these are delicious -- I&#039;m not sure if they should have risen more, between my poor baking skills and a wonky oven I am never sure!!!    But they taste wonderful with the intriguing blend of walnuts, chocolate and lemon essence, really different ,  my husband was VERY pleased with these sweet treats!   (and the sweet potato, lol, they will neer know! ;)  )  Thank you, Linky, lovely recipe I really enjoyed making!!"
2000276988,506597,2015/6/17,0,This cookie recipe is amazing. I doubled the recipe and made  over 60 large cookies. I made these for a client and now he wants me to cater parties for him. AAA+ recipe
242729,499927,2014/1/26,5,"A simple and spicy little number and one that we both loved. I halved the quantities and served this chilli chicken with salad, red onion, avocado, Cheddar cheese and freshly squeezed limes. I also hand-chopped my chicken for a chunkier finish and we ate it with warm tortilla wraps. I loved the ancho chilli and cumin combo and the smoked sea salt that I also used added a lovely smoky flavour. Made for Make my Recipe in the Aussie Forum and bookmarked for future delectation. FT :-)"
2814979,501124,2013/6/23,4,A really superlative vegan main dish.  I will be using the method of dredging in cornstarch and frying in a lot of recipes.  It worked perfectly as the chicken substitution in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!
1800180050,501588,2013/11/3,5,"The butter crispies and snowballs are awesome. My mom has used this recipe for over 30 years. These cookies were the highlight of many holiday care packages she sent me and my family while in the military. The cookies are light and flavorful, not doughy like some sugar cookies. Especially good with cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top. Grandma&#039;s cookies are the best."
852554,503114,2013/7/31,5,Great way to use up rhubarb!  I added in a splash of vanilla too and served over ice cream - tastes like summer!  Made for zwt9
67728,505806,2013/8/26,5,"This was very nice over some sliced canned peaches. Sorry, I didn&#039;t have any coconut milk in the house that wasn&#039;t light, so my sauce might&#039;ve been a bit thinner than intended, but it was still yummy nonetheless. This isn&#039;t too sweet, so it&#039;s perfect with super-sweet fruits. I liked how the bit of salt made it more complex, too. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9"
47892,510476,2014/9/6,5,"All spices used were whole and they were lightly toasted in a clean, dry cast iron skillet first then pulverized in my handy coffee mill aka spice grinder. Will try this on chicken thighs this weekend for one of our final BBQs of the season. Many uses including baked goods and coffee. I always make a small batch for freshness and quality. Thanks! Prepared for CQ 2014."
163112,510476,2014/9/9,5,Stellar!  I used this on tofu &#039;cutlets&#039; ( i slice tofu blocks lengthwise into 2 or 3 slabs) then pan fried until crispy.  Happy family!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ.

128473,510476,2014/9/11,5,"Mmm smells so wonderful.  So much better than store bought.  Can&#039;t wait to  use it.  I ground everything fresh, with my motar and pestle, what a great workout. I even ground my cinnamon by hand.  So much nicer this way.   Made for Culinary Quest 2014 - Suitcase Gourmets."
2001434471,530689,2017/3/14,5,"This recipe is so simple and tastes exactly like Panda Express, if not, better! Will definitely do this again, a definite keeper! Thank you!"
2001434481,530689,2017/3/14,5,"This is a wonderful recipe, I doubled everything to accommodate my bigger family. Other than that I followed everything to the tee and it turned out perfect!"
2001247874,530689,2017/11/16,5,"Awesome, quick and tasty recipe. I left out the sugar, because I think Panda's food is too sweet to my taste anyways. I also added 4 chopped green onions, which livened the flavor up a bit and also gave some good color in a slightly bland colored dish. My family LOVED it!!"
226753,505665,2014/1/26,0,"I always feel less-than-gourmet when I use canned soup, but this recipe produces a very simple, comforting casserole that suggests days gone by and church suppers.   When I first encountered this recipe - where, I don&#039;t remember - it suggested substituting broccoli for some of the chicken, and sprinkling a layer of cheddar cheese over the chicken/broccoli before adding the topping.  I use frozen broccoli cuts - really frozen, not defrosted, so that it doesn&#039;t overcook during the baking process.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because of my guilt regarding the canned soup.  ;-)"
2001595767,505665,2017/6/22,5,"We made this today in our church Soup kitchen X 50. It was delicious, tasted like grandmother's recipe and everyone was giving the cook compliments when the meal was over. We loved it!"
486725,507528,2014/2/11,5,"Definitely the best cooking method - makes it crispy and scrummy. I used mustard greens, but all the greens are great this way. Serving size is generous; I scaled this down, but think the amount the recipe calls for can probably feed 2-4 times the number of people listed (and we are big veggie eaters)."
143721,503433,2013/7/16,5,"Wow, I really liked this recipe.  I must admit that I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I happened to have a bag of coleslaw mix so I used it instead of shredding the vegetables separately.  Also, I didn&#039;t have any sweet pickle relish in the house so I used my own canned pepper relish.  This will be made again and again.  The pineapple really gives this a nice refreshing twist.  Made for ZWT9 and The Apron String Travelers."

39835,503433,2013/9/14,5,Wonderful coleslaw. I shredded the two types of cabbage together in the food processor. this was wonderful with fish tacos. Thanks for sharing!
2378314,510050,2014/10/4,5,"This bread is delicious! Very moist and just the perfect pumpkin flavor. I did not do the streusel because I don&#039;t like nuts in my breads, and without the nuts the streusel was kind of liquid. I ended up swirling it into the bread so there was extra ribbon of cinnamon sugar in the middle. So good, my husband loved it!"
844554,511612,2014/5/2,4,"Good tasting soup with an easy prep time. It was a tad bit bland so I added salt, cumin and cayenne pepper. It still needed something to jazz it up but we ate it for dinner and have enough for dinner tomorrow nite. Made for PAC Spring 2014."
2001346061,511612,2017/1/10,1,Ew it tasted terrible
226863,515560,2014/5/23,5,"Excellent recipe!  The salsa is delicious, and the fish is nicely seasoned but not overly so.  I&#039;ll be making this again so I can get a photo of the beautiful colors!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PRMR tag game."
1802743723,525042,2017/10/15,0,"Used chicken boullion in place of broth , (saves all the cans and cartons) so yummy and good. Would be wonderful on a cold winter night!"
126440,496913,2014/6/12,5,"Great appetizer.  I could have it as a main course.  Loved the sauce, it just made the dish.  I did use chicken meatballs that I had leftover but made the same way.  I served with tilapia and Asian noodles."
2324285,510237,2013/12/26,5,"Delicious comfort food!  I actually tried to bring down the calories by using lean beef franks, skim milk and homemade low-fat chili, but it was still delicious.  This really tastes like a chili cheese dog, and I wouldn&#039;t leave out the yellow mustard because it&#039;s the perfect topping.  I&#039;d love to try making this with a cornbread mix instead of bisquick next time!"
498271,504351,2013/11/14,5,"Oh BOY are these good!  Just like my favorite cinnamon/sugar cake donuts.  It seems like a lot of nutmeg but use it all - that&#039;s what gives these such great flavor.  I don&#039;t have a mini muffin pan so made them regular sized; I got 8 muffins out of the batch.  I just dipped the tops in melted butter, then in the sugar/cinnamon mixture, so I didn&#039;t need as much of either.  Thanks for sharing the recipe for this tasty treat!"

I took shredded coconut the stuff in the blue bag, put it through a food processor to Pulse and dip the donuts in that. I’ve also used fancy sugar to do different flavors as well. Seems like the flavor options are endless"
594620,524791,2018/4/19,5,"I wish I had not taken so long to review this recipe. It is FABULOUS. We try to soak and/or sprout all of our grains before use and this recipe was perfect as we already had sprouted brown rice and sprouted sweet brown rice flours. No substitutions necessary and that is always a plus! The crust was delicious, flaky and wonderful for our pecan and pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving last year. I have used this omitting the sugar for some seafood pot pies and it was amazing. My daughters are especially thankful to Jude because they can have real pie that isn't typically nasty for gluten-free options. Also, we make just this crust sometimes and cut it into strips. We sprinkle them with organic cinnamon/coconut sugar mix and bake. Such a welcomed treat in our home. THANK YOU, JUDE! Thank you so very much! :)"

226863,508096,2014/8/29,5,"Super delicious!  I made this with the purple potatoes, and shared a photo in the Culinary Quest thread.  Beautiful and delicious!"
135470,508096,2014/8/29,5,Delicious! I searched for purple potatoes but couldn&#039;t find any :( Made for 2014 Culinary Quest for the Cruisin Culinary Queens.
226867,508096,2014/9/21,5,"Yummy! I used a mix or red and yellow potatoes. It took longer than expected to cook through, but worth the wait! made for Culinary Quest 2014"
226863,505692,2013/8/21,5,"Yum!  What a welcome meal that is quick to prepare and looks beautiful.  After a long day at work the easiness of this recipe vaults it to 5 star standing.  I left out the water chestnuts (personal preference) and used a mix of sugar snap peas, carrots and broccoli for the vegetable mix.  I used the bean sprouts, and just loved that addition. Served over basmati rice.  I used the sauce sparingly, since I&#039;m trying to not go overboard with sodium.  The peanut and scallion garnishes were perfect.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game."
50509,505692,2013/9/7,4,"If you use a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies, this is as quick as a flash. I have found several decent blends, and that&#039;s what I used. I omitted the bean sprouts, as I did not want to go to the market and we don&#039;t really like them. Reduced the amount of soy sauce, and it was plenty flavorful. I did add some grated ginger, which I think works well with this type of dish. Thanks for a quick meal idea."
546010,510969,2014/3/3,5,"Delicious in every way! This is a bit labor intensive so be sure to have everything prepped and ready to go. I did make some changes to the recipe. I used Israeli couscous and decided not to stuff the breasts. I saut&eacute;ed the chicken breasts, finished off in the oven, then placed them on top the couscous, sprinkled with cheese &amp; sauce. I may make more sauce next time. The couscous is to die for. It would make a great side to any meal. Thank you for posting, you saved me the trouble :D . It&#039;s a winner and we will be making this often. Even the picky kids loved it."
2001822547,534029,2018/1/1,5,I used a different frosting because I had some left from a Yule log. My guests really loved these cupcakes. They said they tasted ‘grown up’. The champagne flavor comes through and the “confetti” was fun!
2001906087,534029,2018/1/1,1,"Hands down, the worst recipe I’ve ever tried to work with. Tried it twice and they come out raw and burned all at the same time. I’ve been baking and cooking all my life and have never had any cupcake turn out like this. Awful. Don’t waste your time or ingredients."
804550,497234,2013/3/19,5,"AMAZING! INCREDIBLE! WOW! These brownies are just like the description states, gooey, chewy and so chocolate that they are not for the faint of heart. Just like promised by the name my MIL is comatose on the couch after eating one small piece. I made these especially for her as she has an extreme love for dark chocolate. She approves of these brownies with all her heart! When making these I made them as written including the optional semi sweet chocolate chips. I gave up mixing the batter with a spoon after I added the unsweetened chocolate and chips. I put latex gloves on and kneaded the chocolate into the mixture. The batter became a very dense dough which I placed into the greased baking dish and pushed and flattened it with my hands to conform to the shape of the dish. I baked it for 40 minutes and waited for it to cool. Since the Chef didn&#039;t specify a dish size I used a 9x12 inch. My brownies were about an inch tall, so if you want a thicker brownie then use a smaller pan. Made for Spring 2013 PAC."
2324285,511331,2014/1/2,5,"I really liked these sweet potatoes.  Despite all the ingredients, it&#039;s not cloyingly sweet at all, and the cumin adds a nice exotic flavor.  I boiled my potatoes instead of roasting them- saved so much time!  Served with a roasted garlic gravy."
724631,505191,2013/9/28,4,"As long as you want gourmet fried onion, this is fabulous with Recipe#505190.  DH did not want the onion, so his sandwiches overcooked.  If doing without the onion, provolone would be so much better than processed American cheese."
1179225,505191,2015/1/25,5,"We really enjoyed these! Didn&#039;t serve them with your soup, but another that I had made. I used American one one side of the onion and shredded mozzarella and some parmesan on the other. I don&#039;t think you could go wrong using any easy to melt cheese. The onions were not overpowering, just fabulous. Perfect balance of cheese and onion. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe."
1802574561,508092,2014/3/12,5,"The multiple meats, the red wine, the veggies, all of it, very tastey.  A very nice blend of flavors,  a deliciously complicated mouth full.  Serve it with a nice, crusty loaf of french bread and some parmesan.  This is one I will use again.  Would be great to serve when having friends over."
333017,508092,2014/11/27,3,"I am a big fan of Cook&#039;s Illustrated and found this recipe in their latest pasta cookbook.   What caught my attention was the the combination of meats and wine.   I guess, &quot;to each their own&quot;!  This recipe did nothing for me.  There was lots of meat and a watery liquid sauce.  Big, bold taste was definitely there...found it a bit on the brash side!  I am going to water it down with marinara sauce and make some baked pasta dishes with the left overs.  Way over 6 cups of sauce for me.  Probably not one I will come back to again!  Too bad....absolutely adore Cooks Illustrated!"
2001723709,508092,2017/9/21,5,"This is an amazing recipe. I simmer mine for a few hours, I use the puree chicken livers (but halve the suggested amount) and you must incorporate the unflavored gelatin- while those two ingredients may seem odd they are important components to the dish!! I have been making this recipe for years (since it came out in Cooks Illustrated in 2009) and I've WOWED a lot of family members and friends. They tell me it's the best Bolognese they have ever had!! Trust me folks this one is a keeper. Oh, and I double the recipe because my family wants left overs!!!"
542159,494434,2013/2/9,0,"Decided not to rate this as we ended up pouring it out as both DH and myself just found it had a stage taste with an awful after taste. Though we would love this as we both love limeade but%u2026.. After much debate we thought maybe it was because we have been on low sodium diets for some years and this had what tasted like a lot of salt to us (recipe called for a full teaspoon), so sorry."
452355,498345,2013/5/11,4,"We liked that this tikka recipe was pretty easy to prepare and that it was chock full of colorful, healthy veggies.  I thought it needed a little heat, so I added crushed red pepper flakes to my serving.  We served over basmati rice.  Made for May 2013 Veggie Swap."
1680722,508830,2013/11/28,5,"Delicious and very comforting during the cold days! Prepared for myself; to this I found out that the right quantity for me is calculated if entering &quot;0.5&quot; in the field &quot;serving:&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;I boiled my Asian dark roasted coffe (I suppose it&#039;s a&quot;Coffea robusta&quot; variety) with cardamom (only one crushed cardamom pod, as fresh it taste much more) and water; then filtered through a clean cotton tissue. I added hot milk and 20 g dark chocolate (from a bar). Stirred until dissolved and added about 1 teaspoon sugar,&lt;br/&gt;The combination with chocolate and cardamom is phantastic! Thanks a lot for this warming coffee!"
169430,508830,2013/11/28,5,"I made this a couple of weeks ago and completely forgot to review it, D&#039;oh. Thanks very much to awalde for reminding me. I used sugar free chocolate syrup and Splenda so that I could enjoy this wonderful cup of pure pleasure. Simply loved the chocolate and cardamom flavors in my Corta&#039;s Mediterranean coffee."
128473,508830,2017/10/20,5,"Wow, this is such a great coffee, I can't believe that I haven't tried it before. Love the spice, the chocolate and the almond milk. Lovely depth of flavor. Thank you for sharing your many wonderful recipes Sharon. You will be missed."
2000376685,522815,2015/8/1,5,Tasty very delicious!
126037,496341,2013/3/14,5,"These are delicious and I love how they look!  Using the Simply Potatoes made them a quick side dish.  Even though I don&#039;t have a mini-cheesecake pan, I used a muffin tin.  They took a bit longer to cook.  I substituted crispy bacon and sharp cheddar because I had those on hand.  Definitely a recipe I&#039;ll use again."
2718447,496341,2013/3/14,5,"My sister gave me this recipe a few months ago.  I&#039;m so glad she entered it into the contest.  I have now made this dish four times, including taking to a potluck, (where they were the first to go), and into my daughter&#039;s school lunch!   It&#039;s the perfect dish with steaks for a dinner party;  my guests loved them.  If you&#039;re looking for something easy and delicious, give these a try!"
689768,496341,2013/3/16,5,Another awesome recipe from Bibliobethica!!
2745694,496341,2013/3/20,5,This is a great recipe and my kids love them.

2747565,496341,2013/3/21,5,Quick and yummy.  Great recipe biblio!
2734669,496341,2013/4/1,0,"(Mar 12) I was looking at this recipe when I saw 5 stars and thought great, I will try it. But then I noticed that it was one reviewer, whom claims to have made this recipe on 4 different occasion (for an elegant dinner for guests, a potluck and a school lunch, etc)... all in a matter of 2 days from Bib&#039;s recipe posting (Feb 28) to Towels reviewing (Mar 2). And then a &quot;1 person found this review helpful&quot; tag was made by the reviewer. I may still try the recipe, but I will not base my choice on this one review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Mar 15) UPDATE: I see that the &quot;original&quot; review has been updated with a reasonable explanation. You could see the possible confusion for anyone reading the first review. Thank you for clarification. I may still try these. Good luck in the contest.&lt;br/&gt;(Apr 1) UPDATE We decided to try these with our Easter meal. We were serving pork loin, so we used bacon for the meat portion of this recipe. We made them in a cupcake pan like the picture shows. They were pretty good for the amount of ingredients allowed for the contest you were playing. Thanks."
599450,503051,2013/8/11,5,"Throw calories to the wind! This is GREAT! Thanks, Dienia! For another great recipe. Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
145352,503671,2013/7/15,5,"Yum!!! It was great coming home to the comforting dish!!! Went together fairly quickly in the morning. The flavors are very homey, in spite of the heat from the jalapenos. Made for ZWT 9."
1801519864,497495,2013/12/29,5,"Super easy all in one dinner.  I spent 20 minutes of active time, prepping the next stage while one cooked like recommended &amp; had a fabulous dinner.  Usually &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;quick&quot; recipes take me longer than they state, because I don&#039;t have someone prepping my ingredients for me, that they don&#039;t take into account, this did not.  Was great leftover too.  This will make the weeknight rotation."
317187,522989,2015/8/13,0,"This is a great &quot;go to &quot;recipe.  I have been doing it this way for years.  Sometimes , put in a baking dish and top with crushed Ritz Crackers and bake for a few minutes to brown it up and get a soft crust!"
2175011,495682,2013/9/22,4,"Excellent! I made this when company came over, and they loved it!"
482933,502461,2013/8/23,5,"Enjoyed this very much! Soaked in water about 30 minutes in same pan I baked in. Timing is spot on, appreciated that it could go in oven with recipe#95077.  Added it to my oven 350 cookbook.  Thanks for sharing."
400708,502461,2013/9/7,5,"It&#039;s corn season and found this recipe while playing &quot;Please Review My Recipe Game&quot; and I sure picked a winner.  It was so easy, fast and the timing spot on.  Perfectly cooked with the butter melted all through - YUM!!  You&#039;ve got to try this easy way to prepare."
542159,502461,2013/9/8,5,Hooray DH was able to do this alone and enjoyed it. I left the recipe out with the corn out on the counter this morning before I left for work hoping DH (who cannot boil water) would have with his leftovers for lunch today and he not only successfully made also said it was easy and good. Thanks for the post.
165933,514981,2014/5/27,4,This was an interesting dish.   I had never thought of toasting the sage before adding it to the dish.  Great flavor.  Thanks.
163112,502505,2013/7/23,5,"I am rating this on the final result.  OMG the BEST cauliflower we&#039;ve had EVER.  The vinegar really makes it sing! BUT I worry about the proportions.  I only used 1 small cauliflower - less than 1lb.  I made the regular amount of sauce.  I had missed the part about that cooking for 30 minutes.  I hadn&#039;t accounted for the time so I cranked the heat &amp; reduced it in 10 minutes.  I don&#039;t see how that liquid could cook for 30 minutes at anything but the lowest simmer &amp; still have enough for 6lbs of cauli?  Anyway, I added the cauli to the reduced sauce, turned it down a but, put the lid on &amp; let it cook for 30 minutes.  When it was soft, all that was left was the oil.  I used a slotted spoon to scoop out the cauli &amp; garlic (OH!!  for 40ml garlic:  1 average clove is 5ml).  We sprinkled some salt at the end.  1 small head was enough for 2 good sized servings which we devoured.  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers. :)"
1925885,504698,2013/7/30,5,"I must admit the ingredient list seemed a bit odd.  Orange juice and coffee???  But I was more than pleasantly surprised by this cocktail and it has made its way onto the Cocktail Recipes list that is posted on the inside of my glassware cabinet for quick reference.  LOL!  Thanks, Nancy, for posting this tasty concoction!  Gourmet Goddesses ZWT9."
383346,504698,2013/8/5,5,"Great drink, so tasty.  I do almost the same but without the lime juice (yellow bird in my recipes).  This one is less sweet.  Thanks Ck2plz :)  Made for ZWT 9"
599450,504698,2013/8/6,5,"After my first sip, this was 4 stars. After a few more sips, I really like this! The flavors really meld together well. DH says that after two servings this could make it to 7 stars! Won&#039;t even go there! Made with Starbucks coffee liqueur, Bacardi light rum, Finlandia vodka, and freshly squeezed lemon/lime juices. Thanks, fellow Gourmet Goddess, Ck2plz! Made for ZWT9."

2703713,495271,2013/2/20,5,Ms. Jaylin Hawkins has really did her thing with this Spinach and Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast! 5 stars up!
2704845,495271,2013/2/21,5,Excellent dish! I loved the use of parmesan cheese and the seasoned bread crumbs. I didn't have to add any salt to this dish. It's as of the favors married together. Mmmmmm!
2705013,495271,2013/2/21,5,"I saved this recipe for my day off since I thought it would take up my day.  Fact was, it didn't!  We eat chicken often, so this was a great recipe to add to my cookbook.  The chicken turned out with a little texture on the outside,  tender, juicy and flavorful inside.  The Hidden Valley Ranch was just delicious and not over-seasoned.  The cheese and spinach stuffing appealed to my love of anything ""Florentine""!!  I rate the dish as an excellent meal for family and even formal dinner parties. I paired it with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.  Absolutely delicious!"

2706705,495271,2013/2/23,5,"This recipe was excellent. I made this for my children and they loved it. My daughter loved the spinach which she calls ""the green stuff"". I was so happy both of my children loved this dish. I will definitely try this again and share this recipe. Thanks food.com and jaylin"
2708362,495271,2013/2/23,0,"A simple, clean recipe. Oh did I mention tasty also? Good job,

2710710,495271,2013/2/25,5,I tried this dish last week. Loved it..
2710763,495271,2013/2/25,5,I love to eat but i don't like to cook much. My lady friend doesn't cook much either so this dish was perfect for us both. I don't eat olives so we used them in her chicken and not mine.
2697638,495271,2013/3/24,5,My kids love this dish  ...great job fast and easy to make
2755965,495271,2013/3/26,5,Tried this to impress my girl she loved it thanks.
140132,495271,2013/9/23,5,"Mmmmm, this is worthy enough for company!  I made this for my family and we inhaled it!  The spinach is delicious in this and the chicken stays nice and moist.  Thank you for sharing with us, its a keeper for sure!"
497152,495271,2014/5/15,0,This recipe is outstanding.  The flavor was off the charts.  I will definitely be making this again.
2123645,495271,2014/9/19,4,"This chicken recipe is delicious. The stuffing is the best part, by far! I found that I had a lot of stuffing left over, and my chicken breasts were stuffed very full as it was. However, everything else was wonderful."
12837831,495271,2015/1/17,5,This dish was extremely easy to make. I added in swiss cheese as well to bring it up a notch and I loved it ! Delicious!
2000203597,495271,2015/5/14,5,"I prepared this dish for Mother&#039;s Day 2015 and everyone absolutely loved it!  I used a few extra seasonings and I added more spinach as well as added mushrooms, I didn&#039;t use the eggs as the recipe called for and it was still delish!  Everyone raved about it...I will prepare this dish again and again!!"
2000887954,495271,2016/2/23,5,simply delicious. this recipe went right into my keep pile. super easy to prepare and presents well on the plate. i will definitely cook this for dinner guests.
2000899220,495271,2016/3/2,4,"Great recipe. I ended up using frozen spinach which worked just as well. A bit of difficulty keeping the stuffing mixture in, so cheated a bit and used twine to keep it together (as shown in photos). Will definitely be making this again. Next time will be making it for dinner parties as it can all be prepared before guests arrive and kept in fridge, then throw it in the oven whilst your having an aperitif (no trying to entertain guests whilst still preparing food!). Fianc&eacute; devoured it and couldn&#039;t compliment it enough"
2001356926,495271,2017/2/18,5,"Absolutely wonderful! DH and finicky 7 yr. old daughter loved it too. Didn't make any changes, and I don't think I will next time. Thanks for a terrific recipe!"
2001424376,495271,2017/3/8,0,I am going to try this tonight.
2001424583,495271,2017/4/19,5,Really yummy!! Husband said the stuffing was amazing!! It was very easy to make! Will definitely make this recipe again.
2001648148,495271,2017/7/30,5,"Perfection! Was a HUGE hit. Making now for second time. Didn't have the ranch seasoning this time, but had a packet of Lipton herb soup mix. We'll see! Didn't use too much jut in case it doesn't come out as well. Thanks!!"
1579854,495271,2018/11/1,5,"Everyone (5 adults 2 teens) thought it was incredible and I have to forward this link to family tonight. This is best 'find' in several years. Thanks for sharing! I cooked 3 very large chicken breasts halves for 30+ minutes. I used about a pound and a half of spinach and completely overstuffed the breasts. However, the chicken still came out exceptionally moist. I also used less than a tablespoon of the ranch seasoning total and withheld the olives."
2002332148,495271,2018/11/14,5,This dish is so good! We love it! I have to use toothpicks because I stuff them so full! Thanks for a great recipe!
425105,513321,2017/11/25,4,I tried this 3 times just to be sure what I thought. First time I subbed fig spread for the cranberry sauce. 2nd time I used freshly baked (warm cranberry sauce). The final time I used cooled overnight homemade cranberry sauce (Sharon's recipe) but switched the cheese to Monterey Jack. I definitely liked it best the 3rd time. I guess the brie cheese just didn't work for me for some reason as a grilled cheese. Also used olive oil instead of butter each time...that's just the way I always make grilled cheese.
169430,505571,2013/8/15,5,I almost forgot to review this! I made it at about mid-morning and it just hit the spot perfectly. I very recently picked up a good supple of mint for our ZWT9 trip to Morocco/Tunisia. I used a bit of Splenda and fully enjoyed Morocco&#039;s national beverage.
37449,505571,2013/8/16,5,"Yum, I love mint tea and enjoyed it with the green tea.  I drank this warm, then added ice to have cold later. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013."
852554,505571,2013/8/20,5,Mine was super minty because I use my David&#039;s Tea North African Mint green tea along with the mint leave!  I knew I had nice breath after that! Made for ZWT 9.
107135,505571,2013/8/21,5,easy tastes great i did same as sharon lol zwt9
163112,505571,2013/8/23,5,"Fabulous!  It was a bit sweet for me but I generally drink unsweetened tea.  I used 4 skimpy TBs.  I added ice &amp; drank it cold.  It was perfect that way!  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
47892,505571,2013/9/6,5,"I used Tazo brand &#039;Zen&#039; green tea, unbleached white sugar and fresh spearmint from our garden! This method of brewing tea is identical to the way our friend from UK taught us to make proper English tea about ten years ago! The tea was served in my Fiestaware espresso cups. Made for Zingo/ZWT 9. Thank you!"
128473,505571,2016/10/29,5,"Wow, was this ever good. I loved it...big bold mint flavor with green tea. It was so easy to make and tastes amazing. I will be making this quick and easy to make treat often. Made as written and wouldn't change a thing for What's on the Menu Tag Game."
330505,509851,2013/12/6,4,"*Edited Review: I must edit to add that these were a huge hit at work, so I am raising  the stars from a 2 to a 4.  People at work said they were perfect. &lt;br/&gt;Original review:  I made these today hoping to put them on a cookie tray that is going to work tomorrow.  For them being called Devils Food I expected them to be much more chocolaty in flavor.  The cookie itself is soft, but to this chocolate fiend it just lacks flavor.  I looked up a similar recipe on another site to find out exactly how much 1 square of unsweetened chocolate would be, and it said 2 oz.  I put in just over that and it still needed something.  May instead of one square it should be 1 bar (4 oz)?  The frosting is just so-so.  Be sure to blend the butter and cream cheese before adding the powdered sugar and then vanilla.  I added them all together because no directions were given and my vanilla is still clumped up on the bottom on the mixing bowl.  Sorry, but I don&#039;t believe I&#039;ll be making these again.  If you like a soft barely chocolate cookie with frosting, then these are for you. I guess I am just too die hard of a chocolate fanatic.   Who knows...maybe after they set for a day they&#039;ll taste better.  That happens some times.  Made for New Kids on the Block tag game."
593927,492863,2013/1/18,4,"I doubt this is Omani but anyhow we liked the taste (we, DD1 (5 years old) and I did not use mayonnaise) It looks like a pretty flower. Just be careful not to cut too deep or the flower will break apart. I used Organic free range eggs (that at least means there is no hormones and antibiotics in the things, but they are grain fed which is not a chickens natural diet! which should be grass. And free range does not define how long they are let outside and how big the space is which may not have any grass to begin with!). I omitted the green pepper as it is not to our tastes. I used plain mustard, sea salt to taste (less), light tasting extra virgin olive oil, some white vinegar and a dash of recipe#257499 instead of pepper as we are travelling and that is what I have on hand here! I used plumb tomatoes, organic baby spring mix, flat leaf parsley, for the garnish, plus the rest of the ingredients. Made for  January 2013 ~ NA/ME Explores OMAN!%u200F"
266635,504308,2013/12/1,5,"We love smoked salmon bagels and now we love this crostini.  This an easy appetizer to make and it really makes a nice presentation.  Next time, I may add additional prepared horseradish sauce to the cream cheese as I really love the taste.  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
1680722,504308,2014/9/3,5,"As I saw this recipe I knew that this was perfect for me as I had smoked salmon, horseraddish, cream cheese and fresh dill in the fridge. In the freezer I had the bread!&lt;br/&gt;In this way I managed to prepare this in a few minutes. Combined with some leftovers this made a wonderful surprise speedy dinner. Thanks a lot for this great recipe!"
296809,504308,2014/12/1,5,"I am not sure how I missed this recipe during the Quest, but now it has been made for the Sweet December Tag Game. This recipe would be welcomed into every Icelandic home &amp; some version of it is often eaten for breakfast, lunch, afternoon coffee or starter dinner courses. I halved this recipe for 2 of us using individual baguette rolls &amp; sliced them the same as you would baguette bread. The recipe was otherwise made as written except that I also added 2-3 sml pieces of very thinly-sliced red onion plus a few capers atop the crostini. Eaten as a starter snack before a leftover meal, DH &amp; I were very happy. Thx for sharing your recipe w/us, Agent Special K."
88099,494481,2014/2/28,4,These were so very easy make.  Overall a nice recipe but not very sweet.  I even used cinnamon graham crackers and they were still not very sweet.  I used about 14 graham crackers to cover my pan and used a little more than called for both pecans and walnuts to cover the top.  I think I will add a little more sugar to the butter mixture next time.  Thanks for sharing.
2001211470,506606,2016/10/18,3,Although a good recipe this isn't the original ann landers recipe. Don't even know what maggi seasoning is
2001285983,506606,2016/12/7,5,"This is exactly,the recipe I have used for years. Mine calls for msg. This is my favorite recipe for meatloaf."
2032595,506606,2018/8/8,0,"the original ann landers recipe I have is exactly as written above, except that is specifically calls/says Accent seasoning brand instead of the maggi/msg"
305531,504308,2014/12/11,5,"Yum! These were really good. Like twissis, I love the bagel and smoked salmon with red onions and capers and might try adding those next time too. But these were wonderful as is. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper, Kathy. Made for Sweet December tag.."
895132,504308,2014/12/13,5,Yum indeed :) These are so easy and so delicious. I used my latest attempt to making a gluten free baguette which didn&#039;t turn out well as baguette but made nice crostini after toasting the slices in the oven. For the dill weed I used dry dill because I found that I had forgotten to buy fresh one. Next time I&#039;ll use the fresh one! This was a very nice dinner with some salad. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for Sweet December Game.
128473,504308,2014/12/25,5,"This was a wonderful birthday treat, I really enjoyed it.  Thank you so much for sharing this quick and easy to make dish.  Made exactly as written but I used minced lemongrass in place of the dill as I was out.  The salmon was the star of the dish.  I served it over a lightly toasted cabiatta bun.  Can&#039;t wait to have this again.  Made for Sweet December 2014."
226867,504308,2015/8/14,5,"I loved the horseradish bit of a kick in the cream cheese! Yum! I likes BK&#039;s idea of using cabiatta buns!
Made for LBOB/Culinary Quest 2015"
865936,504308,2017/9/1,5,My husband surprised me with bagels. I surprised him with this.
486725,504308,2017/9/27,5,"This came out really delicious. I omitted the salt. Loved the subtle horseradish flavor, it gave it a whole new dimension."
107583,492759,2013/4/12,5,Excellent white sauce.  The oregano and garlic really are a nice addition.  I used this on a grilled chicken breast marinated in your recipe #492760.  Made for Spring 2013 PAC.
305531,532490,2017/7/26,5,I made 1/2 of this recipe but haven't used it yet. I will later this week and come back for an updated review. One thing that I can comment on already..........make sure your pan is much larger than you think you need. I thought mine was plenty big enough but this does bubble up a lot!
2001534594,528861,2017/5/13,0,Tried these today and they were very filling but great
2001678279,528861,2017/8/19,0,its very hard hahaha.
743849,509676,2014/2/1,4,"These muffins turned out tasty, but they&#039;re a bit crumbly and messy to eat (which is okay). I had to bake for 32 minutes instead of the 22-24 minutes in the instructions, and I think they might have benefited from a couple more minutes. Like that I had all of the ingredients in the house, so they were easy to put together."
1803055219,509676,2014/8/20,5,"I used All-Purpose Unbleached flour instead of Whole Wheat, and added 1/2 cup of raisins. Moist &amp; oh so delicious!"
339569,507625,2014/3/13,4,Great sauce and tasty chicken -did not need much extra time at 500  so watch carefully. I used skinless so it never did get crisp but it was delish&#039;  I tried the green beans as well but would only give 1 star to them maybe I overcooked them : {
1796771,507625,2014/3/14,4,"I skinned my thighs and took off as much visible fat as I could. I did 500 for 10 minutes. Although the sauce ingredients seemed a crazy mix, it was quite good; and the chicken was moist, tender and delicious. I paired the chicken with a roasted butternut squash/corn/red onion/Craisin medley that also contained cayenne pepper."
339260,512949,2014/4/17,3,"This dip is very easy to make but it is grainier than the con queso that I am use to.  The flavor was very good but I prefer a smoother, creamier texture.  Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2014."
266635,536383,2018/9/13,5,"These were definitely loaded and delicious. I ran out of green pepper, so I used mild green chilies. Loved the red onion and peppers and the creamy texture from the sour cream and cheddar cheese. Great Breakfast!"
2324285,496603,2013/3/11,5,"There's a reason why I check the new recipe feed on food.com every day: it's so I don't miss out on a gem of a recipe like this one!  I love chorizo, lentils, and black beans, so when I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it....  it was great.  I made my own lean turkey chorizo a day earlier to use in this, and served these as tacos.  I skipped the eggs and cilantro, and just topped each taco with a bit of pico de gallo.  These ended up being the best tacos I've ever made, and with the lentils and beans, it turned out to be a very healthy, balanced meal!  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe."
498271,502279,2013/7/2,5,"Spicy and tasty hummus!  I always have a jar of jalapenos around so that&#039;s what I used for the peppers, otherwise made as directed.  I really like the lime/cumin flavor combination in this.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
266635,502279,2014/1/9,5,"Delicious hummus - a great snack to have around the house to serve with veggies and/or blue corn tortilla chips which are our favorite.  The flavors were just right; although I did use less jalapenos (used pickled jalapenos) and since my garlic cloves were fairly large -- I only used 3.  Otherwise, I stayed with the recipe instructions and the result was really delicious.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy as we always keep a batch of hummus around the house. Made for PRMR, January, 2014."
724631,502279,2014/1/28,5,"Enjoyed this hummus very much, although my hummus needed more liquid for the blender to work; next time I would make sure that I had 88g or about 3 fl. oz. of lime juice, as my limes may have been a little dry.  I added more olive oil, although I toyed with adding sesame oil or Chinese hot red chilie oil for the additional amount.  I used only 1 jalapeno so it wouldn&#039;t overwhelm a lactating mama and her 19-mo.-old daughter, who go ape over hummus.  Thank you, Pawel.  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag."
43170105,498083,2014/1/22,5,These are very good. I cut the recipe in half but still had to use 2 eggs to get all the ingredients to stick together. Will make these again!
1072593,492751,2013/4/3,5,My son drove through these like Mario Andretti.  He&#039;s lucky he escaped intact.  *PAC Spring 2013*
2001730000,529146,2017/9/25,5,I've made this dish for over 2 years now. It is absolutely the best! Some people in my family would never easy yams or sweet potatoes before LOVE love this dish. My 13 yr old neice requested it to be made for her birthday. It's so easy to do and taste delicious!
136997,513073,2014/8/2,5,"Very nice and easy side dish. Could benefit from a tad bit of salt, in my opinion, but good as is. :)"
226863,513073,2014/12/7,5,"Yummy rice recipe....I did not use brown rice, but use arborio rice for risotto.  Turned out perfectly, expect I had to heat it up to serve.  I did add some salt to serve.  Dish looks beautiful and is wonderful with fish or chicken.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for &quot;for your consideration&quot; game in yuku."
107135,505411,2014/3/17,5,wow i love this combo .the lemon and lavender pair perfectly . i got lavender at the mexican store here in town .try this one
679953,502258,2013/9/6,5,"First I only used 1 cup of rum.  Second what a refreshing after dinner drink, after painting all the shutters on my house.  I wanted to stop half way through, to try this, but I know that it wouldn&#039;t get done.  The watermelon flavor really comes out nicely too.  All in all very refreshing as this evening the neighbor and I sipped down a couple of these during the football game.  We were satisfied with the results.  Made for Holiday Tag."
80353,502258,2014/8/8,5,"Made for company and everyone thought it was very unusual and so refreshing.  Loved that it used watermelon, which we are swimming in right now.  Will make again for sure."
1925885,502258,2018/8/17,4,"This was definitely a different kind of cocktail! I really liked that the Earl Gray flavor was shining through and through, but thought it had a bit too much rum! The Earl Gray and watermelon combo was great and I'll be making this again with a few tweaks! I've purchased Sweet Tea vodka before, and this reminded me of it. This would make a great substitute in a pinch! Made for SWT 2018, Team IncrEdibles."
39835,503440,2013/7/16,4,Interesting cake which was good with fruit. I like making these types of &quot;ration&quot; cakes to make us appreciate what we have. Thanks for sharing.
280271,511548,2014/3/10,5,Hubby loved this...I did end up adding a touch more milk...but for the rest of the recipe it was spot on...loved the slight taste of rosemary...all the ingredients worked well together...I cut the recipe in half and ended up with what I thought could serve 3...so there&#039;s leftovers for the hubby...thanks for posting the recipe..=)
2900201,493212,2013/7/13,5,"really easy, and very tasty."
1800304485,511850,2014/11/23,1,The recipe calls for 3/4 cup of finely chopped parsley; but ended up being too much parsley.  I may try to make this again with only 1/4 cup of finely chopped parsley; and 2 sleeves of Ritz crackers.
2002147887,509817,2018/5/11,5,"I have made this recipe several times now, always delicious!"
2000164534,511850,2015/4/25,5,"WOWZA!  This stuffing is SOO Very Good!  I?ve made this already several times and served it this past Christmas as an appetizer as stuffed mushrooms and all my guests asked for the recipe.  I?ve also tried it as a topping for haddock using Forevermama?s recipe:  ?ForeverMama&#039;s Baked Stuffed Haddock Or Cod - a.k.a. Scrod? posted on this site and it is way out of this world good.  I just don?t know how the previous reviewer only gave it 1 star, because of too much parsley??  Well, use less.  I didn?t find it to be too much parsley for my taste, but found it to be the best I?ve ever had.  It really is top shelf restaurant worthy!!"
2001266235,497925,2016/11/24,5,It came out wonderful!
599450,504656,2013/8/26,5,"This is absolutely fantastic! Made with Thai basil leaves (although garnished with fresh Italian basil) and kaffir lime leaves, both of which I purchased in jars at my local Asian market. For the green curry paste I used recipe #467553 which I also highly recommend. I chose halibut steak over cod due to preference. Thanks, PanNan! Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
2324915,514162,2014/9/21,5,"Very tasty, and they would have been easy to make if I hadn&#039;t gotten such big pork chops.  Made it a bit of a pain to pound them out.  Also they were a tad bit chewey, so I think I&#039;ll cut back a little on the baking time when I make them again- because I&#039;ll absolutely make these again in the future.  Cream cheese leaked out a little, but a majority of it stayed in place.  I think next time I may soak my tooth picks first- they set off my smoke detector once the broiler was turned on."
1072593,514162,2015/5/29,5,"My dad said this was too good for the kids...so WE ate them by the fistful.  Da pecan don&#039;t fall far from dat tree, does it not?"
1060667,514162,2016/4/15,4,"I loved the flavors but this was dry, dry, dry.  I even lowered the temp and it was still overcooked pork.  If you like your bacon crispy I would precook it halfway then wrap the pork and bake.  4 stars for flavor though :)"
2001664712,532829,2017/8/10,4,"The pitas came out well with the right texture and crispness. I am thinking of modifying this recipe to make zaatar-infused pizza dough as well, with feta cheese, Kalamata olives and other toppings. Maybe, a stuffed pita version for the lunch box. The brand of zaatar I used made all the difference taste-wise, I guess. The blend from https://www.eatzaatar.com/ is high quality with no added fillings, unlike other brands I've gotten from the supermarket. More sumac and thyme in each tablespoon to make even an ordinary salad tastier."
165933,495626,2013/6/24,5,"Made these this morning and it was so much fun!  My first attempt at homemade crackers and they were wonderful.  I used a cheddar/hot pepper cheese, added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon smokey paprika.  It took me 20 minutes to bake but we&#039;re having very high humidity today and that was probably a factor.  Some came out very crunchy and others a bit chewy but they were all great!  I want to try this again using regular hot pepper cheese and perhaps adding some different spices.  Thanks."
865936,496132,2013/9/20,4,This us a really good and also easy way to prepare simple mashed sweet potatoes. I am a huge fan of preparing them in a more savory profile and not so much sweet.
486725,496393,2013/8/16,4,"These were great! We used our own brownie, and tried it with and without the graham cracker. DH liked it better with and I liked it better without! The marshmallow is really the star here."
286566,494574,2013/9/18,5,"I made a full recipe though shared between 3 and we thoroughly enjoyed these very flavoursome carrots, thank you Debbie R, made for Photo Tag game."
128473,494574,2014/2/4,4,"These are very tasty carrots Debbie.  We enjoyed them very much.  I had to turn the heat down from 475 to 425 degrees after 5 minutes because the carrots were burning and not cooking.  That said they turned out great, tender and flavorful with lots of dark flavor.  I will definitely be making these again, but will decrease the amount of sugar and use a lower heat.  Thanks so much for sharing. Made for Name That Ingredient Tag Game."
1800292167,494574,2015/1/2,5,"I kept the ingredients the same for this recipe, but I cooked it on the stove in a skillet because my oven was full.  These were wonderful and I will be making them often!"
13119638,507614,2014/5/20,4,Easy and delicious!
8629,510617,2013/12/10,5,"Oh my goodness, if you love almonds, you&#039;ve got to make this recipe.  I read the reviews for this recipe on foodnetwork.com.  I cut back on the sugar to 1 1/4 c.  My almonds were not very fresh so I just used a sprinkling of them on top. It is a soft, chewy shortbread rather than a crisp shortbread.  It is excellent."
2796729,499628,2013/5/15,5,Another great recipe. Made them for Mother&#039;s Day. They came out perfect. I added white chocolate in the middle of some of them.
780172,499077,2013/7/8,5,"This was a quick and easy recpie whichp I will make again. Next time I will double the recipe as the zucchini shrinks some. I used a zucchini and a yellow squash. Liked the addition on oregano, parsley and feta, really kicked up the flavor."
233583,499077,2013/7/30,5,"mama- Wonderful and so quick.  I love the feta cheese as opposed to mozzarella or cheddar.  So quick and simple and as the farmers markets and what is left of my garden flourish I had everything on hand.  I shared this with a neighbor as we had an impromptu ladies dinner on the porch , potluck style, and all raved for your recipe. (I did pass it along)  I will make this often for myself as a meal and for hubby as a side sans the feta as he is not normal and does not care for it.on his food , in ok but not on  :-(  He married a Greek for Gosh sake.  Simple, delicious and flavors jump out at you.  I was very careful with the salt as feta is very salty so used a tinge at first and adjusted as needed.Made for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap.  update: 7/30/13 Made for the Annual Buffalo NY Garden Walk get together and it was gone so fast I did not get any.  I doubled the recipe and it was a major hit.  Zukes are coming out of our gardens like crazy now so perfect recipe for the gardeners."
582561,499077,2013/12/21,5,"This would have to be the best way of doing Zucchini&#039;s that I have every tried.  And I love zucchini and we eat them often.  I did slice them a bit smaller than 2&quot; on a diagonal line.  The flavours were outstanding.  I used a hard, dryish feta which crumbled easily.  There is nothing that would improve this recipe.  It is perfection.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap December 2013."
251917,499077,2014/2/25,5,Aussie Swap #85: Outstanding!! This dish highlights one of my favorite veggies perfectly and the savory feta cheese - YUM!! We loved this!
632249,499077,2014/5/1,5,"Wonderful recipe, of course you can&#039;t miss when there is feta cheese involved!  I made as written with the exception of the parsley as I didn&#039;t have any on hand. This will be made again!  Spring PAC 2014. Thanks mama smurf!"
1060667,499077,2017/1/9,5,Yummy! I love feta a zucchini and this hit the spot :)
1803751739,520663,2015/2/6,5,Very good!!
452355,503673,2014/6/13,5,"I loved this recipe for dinner tonight.  DH liked it.  The sauce was amazing.  I&#039;m vegetarian, so I subbed my favorite faux chicken that I recently discovered, in this dish (Beyond Meat&#039;s grilled chicken free strips, which happen to be cholesterol and gluten free as well as non GMO).  This worked perfect for me, but meat eating DH likes the strips a little less than I do.  I had half and half on hand that needed using so the pasta wasn&#039;t as skinny as was posted.  I used Earth Balance (vegan) for the butter.  I used a creole seasoning from Spice Merchants.  DH thought the sauce was so good, he might like to have this again sans the &quot;chicken.&quot;  I know I would like it either way.   I am so glad I found sun dried tomato paste as regular tomato paste would not be a substitute, in my opinion.  Going into my keeper file. Thanks, Jan!"
2002276513,536346,2018/9/16,0,"Wow! This savory tart is amazing. I followed the instructions as given. Will be making this one often. To make things easier, I've made a large batch of the jam and canned it so it's on the shelf whenever I want to whip up this delicious tart."
2000864439,536346,2018/9/25,0,I LOVE making Quiche's !! Am going to try this combination .
280271,520577,2015/2/7,5,Wonderful salmon dish...loved the lime flavor...this is very easy to prepare and taste delicious...made for &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; tag game...=)
165933,520577,2015/9/28,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  Did not add the cilantro, DH hates it but parsley was a great color substitute!"
2000716001,524817,2015/11/27,4,this is great item
39835,496011,2013/3/6,5,Very good and easy to make - makes a lot! I used whole wheat spaghetti and ground veal with no problems. Thanks for sharing!
1052873,522916,2015/8/2,5,"Yummy and easy. I used Hershey&#039;s special dark chocolate, melted chocolate chips, and Jif brand hazelnut chocolate spread. Made for C Quest 2015."
560491,497508,2013/4/18,5,SOOOOO GOOD!!  What is not to like?!  I made as written and used Pace Picante sauce (about 3 Tbs).  This potato was a filling but not heavy meal.  Will be making this again!  Going into my Best of Cookbook.  Made for Spring PAC 2013.
14410,492776,2014/5/12,5,"We really liked this! I used a whole red pepper, diced, and left out the onion since it also calls for onion soup mix. I also replaced the cabbage and carrot with a bag of coleslaw veggie mix. This came together really quickly...I barely had enough time to cook a pot of ramen noodles! Next time I make this, I will add baby corn and some broccoli."
204024,501460,2014/5/2,5,This came together very easily and made a nice snack.   Made for PAC Spring 2014.
182312,497664,2017/2/3,0,This was super easy to make and tasted GREAT! Plan to make often.
137302,508378,2014/5/23,3,"There are two major problems with this recipe that I didn&#039;t discover until I had prepared the majority of the ingredients.  The size of the baking vessel is not given and there is no temperature posted.  This definitely caused me problems.  After discovering that a 9 x 12 pan was too big, I switched to a 10 x 7 glass baking dish.  Because I had to guess on the oven temperature I baked at 350 degrees.  After 40 minutes it was definitely not done since not even the sugars were melted.  I baked for 15 min more.  Still not done.  I baked again for another 15 min and then in desperation removed it from the oven.  It tasted okay but was quite dry and not moist at all.  (most likely from the long bake)  It didn&#039;t burn however.  I think if I were to make it again the posting chef would definitely have to change the recipe to reflect the lacking information.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
370332,494246,2014/4/8,5,"This was so savory and delicious!  I added some cauliflower that I intended to rice as a side dish, because I thought the flavors would blend well and I was feeling lazy.  It worked out beautifully.  Next time, I think I will add some almonds or cashews and possibly some golden raisins to make it a little more authentic.  But the spices were spot-on and it was yummy without the nuts and fruit.  Thanks for a great grain-free dish that even my kids loved!"
328048,502828,2013/7/16,4,"This was very good and easy to make. The flavor came mostly from the seasoning, so the type of creole seasoning you use could make a big difference here. Since the veggies were all chopped and not cooked down first, the pieces were larger in the meat than I anticipated and I was afraid that it wouldn&#039;t hold together, so I made meatloaf muffins instead of a full loaf. It was very tender and had a nice spice to it."
107583,502828,2013/7/16,5,"Easy to make and flavorful.  Liked the sauce, because it wasn&#039;t sweet like so many meatloaf toppings.  Looking forward to a meatloaf sandwich tomorrow!  Made for ZWT 9."
480195,502828,2013/7/27,5,I knew I would like this meatloaf because of the ingredients used. I don&#039;t like them if they don&#039;t have vegetables in them. The vegetables in this one gave good texture. It was very tasty and everyone liked it. I will be making it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
47559,503308,2013/8/24,5,"I loved the flavor of this soup.  It was spicy, sour and slightly salty and sweet - just the way I like my Thai food.  I used the kaffir lime leaves and thai basil from my garden, and for the mushrooms some fresh king oysters.  I used only one chicken breast but thought it was plenty. Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers ZWT9."
47892,527658,2016/8/4,5,"This was delicious, light and refreshing, easy and made for a beautiful presentation on the dinner table! After peeling and slicing the cukes I arranged them in a serving bowl then poured the dressing over the cukes. Garnished with shallots in place of standard onion; slices of Thai red pepper. The sugar was whirled in a coffee mill to superfine consistency to make it easier to dissolve in the vinegar. Served with Thai steamed eggs over baby spinach, jasmine rice, strawberries and peaches and fresh corn on the cob. Will make again soon! Prepared for CQ3."
37449,514345,2014/5/26,5,I halved the recipe and just love the flavor! I used decaf black tea bags. Thanks for posting! :D
226867,514345,2016/11/8,5,This is delightful and refreshing! Made for your football win 2016
498271,502443,2013/7/10,4,"This is a pretty tasty meatless burger!  I don&#039;t care for onion so left it out, otherwise made as directed.  I did process until smooth and I think maybe I will leave the mixture a little chunkier next time.  It held together nicely on the grill (charcoal) and that added a great flavor; I think I&#039;d like to try it pan-fried sometime too for a little moister crunch on the outside.  All in all a tasty burger that we enjoyed with dijon mustard, lettuce and tomato - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
126440,502443,2014/8/12,5,"Loved these little gems.  Will make a sauce to go over them as we didn&#039;t have them in a bun.  Loved the lemon flavor, so light and yummy."
266635,505955,2014/8/6,5,"I have been craving pimento cheese and this dish really hit the spot.  DH is loving it and he can&#039;t wait for lunch.  I added a little more cheese, Worcestershire sauce and cayenne.  This is a great recipe -- easy to make and sooo good.  Made for the Culinary Quest - U. S. Southern Region, August, 2014."
1802621805,514757,2014/3/27,5,"Changed the way i think about grilled cheese, just amazing!  Maybe next time i would add some seasoning to the mac and cheese like garlic powder and crushed red pepper."
1802629039,514757,2014/3/30,5,This is an INCREDIBLE recipe!!!
1802632515,514757,2014/3/31,5,SO DELICIOUS!! I&#039;m definitely going to be making this for my family again soon
2000795569,498662,2016/1/2,3,Not sure I screwed up or the heat settings was wrong. Brownie came out cakey; doughy not gooey at all.. Shame.. Will cut down to an egg and less flour maybe? :(
2804893,498662,2013/4/28,5,"took slightly longer than expected in the oven, but the results are amazing! crispy on top but gooey in the middle! fabulous!!! will definitely try this recipe again soon! thank you so much!"
2623909,498662,2013/5/10,5,"These are outstanding. Most brownie recipes are too dry and cakey for my taste. These are fudgy and perfect. I used Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa powder, and Hershey&#039;s Semisweet Baking Melts for the chocolate chips. I added about 1/4 coarsely chopped pecans. Delish. I baked mine in a 13x9 pan, for 20 minutes."
2939609,498662,2013/8/13,5,"Soooo yummy!!  This recipe turns out like the name brand mixes in the store.  We couldnt wait until it cooled to eat it, although I would defniitely recommend it! &lt;br/&gt;We love it and know you will too  :)"
42925448,498662,2013/9/7,5,Absolutely delicious !!! I used Hershey special dark coco and chocolate chips and for an added flare I threw some chocolate chips and a drizzle of Hershey syrup on top right before I popped them in th oven! A huge hit with all my family and friends.
1800361254,498662,2013/11/30,5,The best brownies ever.  Absolutely perfect - that elusive combination of a bit crispy on top and squidgy in the middle.   In my oven they take exactly 23 minutes.
1801601504,498662,2014/3/14,4,Like another reviewer these took me several minutes longer to cook.  I didn&#039;t wait &#039;til the toothpick came out clean though because since there are chocolate chips in it I think it&#039;d be over-done by then.  Mine rose the way they were supposed to but didn&#039;t fall when they cooled so there was a space between the top of the brownie and the rest of it that cracked and broke when cutting.  It tasted awesome but I need a recipe that also looks pretty after cutting.
1802718875,498662,2014/5/5,5,"Instead of butter substituted coconut oil in solid form.  I used 1/4 cup of organic extra virgin coconut oil and used White Lilly self rising flour.  Instead of chocolate chips I used 4 squares of Lindt  85 % cocoa extra dark candy  from 3.5 oz.  bar. I broke the chocolate up and placed on top of the brownie along with a few chopped walnuts on top.  I cooked at 350 degrees in my convection oven for 15 minutes in my 8x8 glass dish.  They came out fabulous, the Best Gooey Brownie Ever"
1802808392,498662,2014/6/8,0,"I&#039;ve been making these for years and they&#039;re delicious, but this recipe is a total rip-off of &quot;Brooke&#039;s Best Bombshell Brownies&quot; from allrecipes.com.&lt;br/&gt;If it&#039;s someone else&#039;s recipe, please give credit where credit is due."
1802849661,498662,2014/11/25,3,"I did not wait for an inserted skewer to come out clean because the way I&#039;ve been taught is that they are over done then, so I pull them when there are just a few crumbs left! They still took a little longer to cook than the time stated. I liked the chocolate chips in there and the crunchy top was one of the better ones I&#039;ve tried - it can be a bit elusive! These were pretty good and definitely gooey, but not the absolute best I&#039;ve ever had."
2000229703,498662,2015/5/27,5,Fantastic. Absolutely gorgeous.
2000235825,498662,2015/5/30,5,This is by far the best gooey brownie with a nice crispy outter that just melts in your mouth. I have made this several times now and everytime it turns out perfect even if you dont have choc chips in it. Ive also added nuts and white choc chips before and it was just as delicious. This is my go to recipie when i want a simple sweet treat. All round family favorite.
2412137,498662,2015/8/28,5,"This is an awesome and easy recipe.  They taste a lot like Betty Crocker chewy brownies yum.  I will say these took longer in the oven than indicated.  I think if your baking in an 8x8 glass dish it takes about 25-30 minutes or more.  I think it because they are cooked into the smaller dish.  Glass might be a difference too not sure.  This happened with other reviewers as well.  So, just adjust the time and use the toothpick method before pulling them out.  Thanks for the great brownie recipe.  Will be my go to for brownies."
2000538741,498662,2015/10/8,0,Absolutely the best brownies we&#039;ve EVER had!!!! Thank you
2000570234,498662,2015/10/17,5,"This without a doubt is the best brownie recipe I&#039;ve ever found. It bears mentioning I possess lacklustre cooking skills and yet still produced a batch of the most decadent, soft, tongue-tingling brownies ever, so that should attest to how amazing this recipe is. The only &#039;criticism&#039; (if you can even call it that) I have is the cooking time indicated falls a little short. Instead, I would recommend 30 minutes in the oven. Otherwise, what I&#039;ve said still stands. 

What are you waiting for? Go bake a batch!"
2000631168,498662,2015/11/1,5,"LOVE these brownies! Have made them 3 times in the past 3 weeks. First tried them in a 13x9 pan, and the batter spread very thin. The brownies still tasted good, but had a very crunchy texture. The past two times I&#039;ve made them in an 8x8 pan and they were fantastic! Went to make them the last time and realized I was out of semi-sweet chips, so I substituted milk chocolate and I loved them even more! My husband and I both say they&#039;re the best we&#039;ve had!"
2000779385,498662,2015/12/27,5,Everyone loved it! Crispy on top and gooey in the centre! ??
2000819981,498662,2016/1/15,5,It took slightly longer than the recommended time and I used less sugar but it came out absolutely fabulous. Thanks for the recipe.
2000500635,498662,2016/2/5,5,"Thank you for sharing your yummy recipe! Have made these with the kids a few times, with and without the chocolate chips( depending on if I have them) and they are awesome either way! Simple to make too with on hand ingredients. Just check at 20 mins as ovens vary."
2001014807,498662,2016/5/20,5,I got so many compliments on these!! They are perfect! I put white chocolate chips once to make my son happy and they were awesome too!!
2001271425,498662,2016/11/26,4,"Taste was good, easy to make. I cooked these 10 minutes over the longest suggested time (35 minutes total). It was not enough. It rose beautifully. I took it out and let it fall. The outside 1 inch was perfect. Excellent crust. The rest of the center was completely wet, not gooey, it was wet through. I waited to see if it would harden, but that was a no go. I give 4 stars because the flavor is top notch. I would cut the chips to half a cup, or possibly 3/4ths. I gather as the outside edges heat and rise the chips are concentrated in the center. (My floured ones did great through out initially, but that is my best guess for the uncooked center. 40-45 minutes, but your edges may be over cooked."
2001366845,498662,2017/1/26,5,Absolutely amazing.
2001416827,498662,2017/3/4,1,"Instructions were very unclear, worst recipe I've ever followed, brownies ended up burnt to a crisp, would not recommend"
2001471921,498662,2017/4/4,0,Very good recipe! Can you freeze these?
2001499658,498662,2017/4/21,5,"Excellent recipe! I used a glass square dish and it took 10 extra minutes to cook. Otherwise, this recipe is fantastic and I would definitely recommend it!"
2001751640,498662,2017/10/14,5,"Hi! I've used this recipe before and absolutely adored it, it's the best brownie recipe I've found by far. I want to make them again, but the person I'm making them for is gluten intolerant. Will this recipe work with rice flour?"
2002026908,498662,2018/3/3,5,"One of mine and my daughters favourite recipes. We tweak the sugar, using a cup of brown sugar, originally by accident due to what we had then it became our normal preference. Great recipe!"
2002079328,498662,2018/3/27,5,Turned out amazing; crispy on top and gooey in the middle! Took into work and everyone raved about them
2002116014,498662,2018/4/15,5,Delicious brownies. It took 35 min for me.
2000660534,498662,2018/7/16,5,These were the best!!
724631,498815,2013/12/11,4,"Think of raisin bread, but with dried apples...  Enjoyable, but I think if I improved my rising technique it would be even better.  Used Woodchuck Hard Apple Cider, which is THE one to buy.  I learned today that serious bread bakers use gram weight measures instead of liquid measures.  In case that puts anyone else off this recipe, 90 g water is 3/8 cup (shy of 100 ml); 15 g hard alcoholic cider is 150 ml; 10 g salt is shy of 2 teaspoons; and 130 g sourdough starter is between 1/2-2/3 cup).  If you haven&#039;t already, go ahead and get a good digital scale that can do grams or ounces.  Apparently I need a dough whisk; I used my gloved hands to mix.  In fact, I did without the stand mixer and used my gloved hands again; apparently the job is quicker in the stand mixer.  I&#039;m not sure I provided a warm enough environment for the rising.  Guess I should use the proof box to guarantee optimal temperature.  Next time, I would use a food processor to chop up the dried apples; and I for one would prefer bigger bits of apple.  Made for Pammyowl Cookathon."
324136,519141,2016/8/31,4,"Made this tonight for dinner. I used one green capsicum and one yellow, and chicken sausages. I think it would be better with beef or pork sausages. I also replaced the red wine with stock and used dried basil. Tasty low cal dinner- will make again, thanks!"
593927,493287,2013/1/9,4,"Taste 5 stars yet the instructions have something to be desired. I used frozen salmon fillets like the introduction suggested. No where did it say to add the tomatoes so I forgot them, I didn't use the turmeric which would have made it yellower, cinnamon or clove, but I did add more tomato paste per red rice preference. I used my own bahrat spice mix like recipe#79179, less extra virgin light tasting olive oil, Basmati rice which just needed 30 minutes soaking, plus the optional black loomi. I would make the basic recipe for this again. Made for January 2013 ~ NA/ME Explores OMAN!%u200F"
679953,507314,2014/5/26,5,"Omitted the honey, and sweetener.. Great as is. and great on a hot day in the yard.  Made for Holiday Tag."
1249567,516886,2014/7/3,5,"Wow!! Excellent dish. I didn&#039;t even peel the potatoes, just scrubbed them. I sliced 4 small, russet potatoes about 1/2&quot; thick and poured about a tablespoon of olive oil over them in the plastic bag, then the onion soup. Shook it all up, placed them in a plastic bowl and nuked on high for 10 minutes. Served them with a little sour cream on the side. This will be a favorite go to potato side dish. Thanks, Carol"
280271,513029,2014/2/13,5,We really enjoyed this dish...I cut my sprouts in half as well as the recipe...and it served 2...I&#039;ve never dipped my sprouts before but the dipping sauce is very tasty...and it was the perfect amount...thanks for posting it...
679953,514555,2014/4/27,4,"Not too fond of the Chia seeds, but still pretty good.  Made for a midday snack."
2367537,501718,2013/6/13,5,"I have tried so many turkey meatloaf&#039;s that I have not liked, this one is very good I never like sugar in  anything so it is unusually that I did add a little ketchup to the sauce  We enjoyed this very much and will make it again"
2002092252,531144,2018/4/3,4,"It was delicious -- it's a streamlined recipe, but it took longer than I thought the first time--definitely not 5 or 10 minutes, more like 45. But I can see with practice it could get quicker, (esp. If you use already peeled garlic and have you sesame seeds already roasted.) Mine was a little too vinegar-y but I admit I had no honey and used agave as a sweetner. I think the addition of pineapple would make the dish much better. It was really good though."
2000055756,498675,2015/3/11,5,better than any takeout
2000145395,498675,2015/4/16,0,I am in the process of making it now and my only thing is that I wish you separated the ingredients needed to marinate the chicken from the ingredients for the sauce. It reads very confusing for someone that really doesn&#039;t cook much but that wanted to try this recipe.
80353,505690,2013/8/28,5,This is sensational - and so easy!  The sweet and savoury sauce was a breeze to make and really complemented the fish (I actually used tilapia).  A keeper.
216999,505690,2013/9/2,5,"This was great, the sauce was tasty and had the right amount of pepper in it, and the whole thing was very easy to make.  Family loved it and this is going into the favorites file!  Made for the Hot Pink Panthers on the Prowl for ZWT9 Zingo."
67728,505690,2013/9/6,5,"Loved this fish! The flavors in this are perfect, and it&#039;s really simple to make. I made this with some sticky rice and Recipe#441847. This was a company-worthy meal, and would definitely make this again. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9 Family Picks"
793359,505690,2016/6/4,5,"Made this with fresh frozen mackerel and my own homemade caramel sauce plus fish sauce, ginger, etc. This is wonderful for fatty fish i.e. sardines, salmon. The sauce flavors the fish so well. This is going into my international seafood category along with the Bok Choy recipe and white rice. Really good."
2001764441,533528,2017/10/24,0,Question: Could I use puff pastry instead of pie crusts? Would the crimping to hold in the sloppy joe prevent the puff pastry from rising?
37449,511119,2013/12/30,5,This turned out very nice! I didn&#039;t have the purple cabbage and used dried tarragon and enjoyed it. Thanks Annacia!
39835,506032,2013/12/23,4,Very good and easy. I used steaks which were on sale and this way a great way to cook them. Thanks for sharing!
80353,503223,2013/8/21,5,I love shakshouka and this is a very tasty and authentic recipe.  The harissa brings it over the top (and is the ingredient that is sadly lacking in most shakshouka recipes).
37449,503223,2013/11/10,5,I too love shakshouka and this was very good. I scaled the recipe back for one. Thanks!
2399085,512379,2014/2/20,4,Made for PRMR! This did have a great flavor but to me the ricotta cheese really overpowers it in my opinion. I am not a ricotta fan so that may be it. 1/2 of the family liked it others did not. I separated from the ricotta cheese and it tasted pretty good. So if I was to make again I would leave out the ricotta cheese and add more mozerella. Thanks for the different variation on a lasagna.
461834,512379,2014/2/22,5,"I served this as a birthday dinner entree for my DS&#039;s girlfriend&#039;s bday and it was so good.  I made the sauce the day before, although cut back to about 3/4 of the amounts for the crushed tomatoes, sauce and paste.  We don&#039;t care for Italian sausage and I didn&#039;t have quite the amount of hamburger to equal  the listed amounts of both meats.  We don&#039;t care for fennel seeds (which maybe why we don&#039;t care for the Italian Sausage) and only one of four of us like ricotta cheese, so we used cottage cheese and only 1/2 of the amount listed for the ricotta.  I also used a 12 oz package of fresh mozzarella slices and then some shredded (not measured) mozzarella cheese, soooo good!!!!  I really enjoyed the added red wine (not something normally in my lasagna) and the amount of sauce in this recipe!!!  The added sugar isn&#039;t noticeable as sweetness but rather helps reduce the acidity, which is needed item for lasagna.  I served this with homemade garlic bread, green beans and recipe#505080.  Sorry for no photo, was busy finishing salad and bread, while DS, his girlfriend and DH were cutting and serving themselves the lasagna.  Sent 1/2 of the leftovers home with DS and kept the other 1/2 for us, so might be able to get a photo from them.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
80353,512379,2014/8/24,4,"Very good!  The sauce especially was full-flavoured and definitely more-ish.  2 lbs of ricotta is just way more than I would use for lasagna, so I used exactly 1/2 that amount, keeping all the other ingredients as called for.  We didn&#039;t miss the extra lb at all, finding proportions &#039;just right, for our tastes at least."
2728063,515004,2014/4/1,5,Absolutely delicious!! And EASY!!
1584953,503123,2013/11/18,5,"I made this recipe years ago, and it&#039;s delicious. I got it out of a Paul Prudhomme cookbook, which I&#039;ve since lost in one of my moves. I&#039;ve been searching all over the internet, but none seemed to be quite the same. I recognized this immediately  Thanks for posting"
107583,502719,2014/5/6,5,"Very easy and great flavor.  I used the chili powder options, which is a nice touch.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
386585,522864,2015/8/8,5,"This was delightful and a great use of my new favorite discovery, miso!  Super easy and super quick.  I did not use minced onion, but added onion powder instead.  Made for Culinary Quest 2015 by a Toasted Tourist."
135470,522864,2018/7/26,3,"Made as written, I marinated the scallops for about 45 minutes and found despite all the delicious flavors in the marinade they didn't really take hold. The onion was probably the most dominant. So while the scallops were good, it didn't seem quite worth the effort. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 testing updating review"

1803104466,501742,2014/9/4,5,Never was much on country style rib&#039;s but this recipe will knock your sock&#039;s of.
1869474,501742,2014/9/21,4,"Cooking technique made the ribs very moist and tender, just a little to much salt. Will use this technique but use less salt. Thank you."
1803275681,501742,2014/10/28,5,I also never was a fan of country style ribs.  I picked them up because they were on sale and thought I&#039;d give it a try.  I am so thankful I came across this recipe.  Absolutely delicious !  Great job Mis. Liz
1675225,501742,2015/1/11,2,"Unfortunately my luck with this recipe did not yield the good results of the others posted.  Too much salt for one; I think sprinkling each piece with the seasoning chosen would be better in getting correct amount. 20 minutes of baking did not give me the browning effect that I desired, so I browned longer.  Did not get  the carmelized effect after 20 minutes so baked longer.  By that time the pan was becoming charred. Baked 2 hours after covering with foil.  That seemed to be appropriate, but the final product had some of the meat dry and charred, I presume from over baking in beginning. ( Guess I can be blamed for that because of cooking longer than designated times trying to get correct visual effects.)   I&#039;ve had better results with other recipes by putting on sauce, covering &amp; baking, then removing cover to brown at end."
1803678181,501742,2015/1/18,5,"Great recipe! The only addition I made was that I added chili powder and red pepper, and sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. We tend to like ours on the spicy side :) otherwise followed the cooking time to a Tee! Thanks for the recipe, will be using this method again and again. :) Otherwise followed the heating instructions"
937051,501742,2015/2/1,1,They were very moist and tender but the salt ruined the food.  Very disappointed.  The browning time and carmelizing did not work either.
2000078801,501742,2015/3/22,4,"I make my own rub and used Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s regular bbq sauce as a base, but the cooking works nicely! This time I used fresh ginger and local raw organic honey in the bbq sauce, yum!"
2000197182,501742,2015/5/10,1,"My 12 year old son and I made this for our family for mothers day dinner this evening.. we were very excited and then we tasted it. We couldn&#039;t even finish it. The salt RUINED everything.  Waste of our money, preparation and time..guess now we will have pb&amp;j. Maybe the recipe instead of tbsp meant tsp. DONT MAKE THIS RECIPE. Disgusting."
2000230725,501742,2015/5/27,0,I have not tried this yet but I think the garlic salt should be changed to garlic powder.

2000340371,501742,2015/7/15,4,"loved the way they turned out, however, too salty for my taste.  I will not add so much salt next batch."
2000368794,501742,2015/7/28,5,I never follow a recipe to a &#039;t&#039; because of my own preferences in terms of certain ingredients and the amount. I made these without  the seasoning and used just a pinch of salt and pepper. They were amazing! Super tender and delicious with baby rays bbq sauce. My husband and kiddo lived them so I&#039;ll be saving this in my recipe folder.
2000474118,501742,2015/9/14,4,"As I have high blood pressure I do not cook with salt. I used granulated garlic, minced onions (flakes) and a no salt version of Emeril&#039;s essence to coat the ribs. They turned out great. As others have stated a greater amount of time is needed to brown the ribs before the 2 hour bake. Really enjoyed these ribs and will make again."
2000538360,501742,2015/10/8,0,It was OK i don&#039;t know what I did wrong it was not tender it was spicy and dry I did exactly everything the recipe said to do
2000581336,501742,2015/10/19,5,"This recipe ROCKS!  I cooked these with my own sauce and they are SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  Mouthwatering, tender, flavour FULL!  Don&#039;t add to much salt...couple of TEASPOONS ....and you&#039;re on your way to pork nirvana!
Thanks Mis Liz!"
2000155788,501742,2017/1/15,1,"I really regret following this recipe. They are very tender, but I wouldn't put any rub on these, just your barbecue sauce you like. They are so salty, that they're inedible. I just waste my time, my meal, and my money. I either need to rinse everything off, or throw these away.??"
2001466940,501742,2017/4/3,5,"I always have a major fail with baking country style ribs and I have been making them for 30+ years. This recipe is the bomb!!! I eliminated those salts and used garlic powder, California Onion powder, Cajun Chicken rub and a tsp. of red sea salt. Following the baking times and temperatures were so spot on to the BEST country style ribs EVER!!!!"
2001478590,501742,2017/4/8,5,"I have gathered recipes for bone in and boneless ribs, shoulder roast, pork loin etc. and consider myself quite accomplished. This recipe has proven to be my favorite for the boneless country ribs. Tender every time and gives ample opportunity for adding spice along the way and lots of drippings for marinade if you want to grill for the last 10 minutes or so."
2001496862,501742,2017/4/19,5,"I fixed these for my husband, very good and tender. I did brown mine a little before taking out of the oven. Plan on making some tomorrow....."
2001031077,501742,2017/7/11,0,"This is perfect! Can't wait to try them. We'll be taking them camping, freeze them and put them on the grill with bbq sauce when ready. Didn't add the bbq sauce but I did add some smoked salt..."
2001622038,501742,2017/7/11,1,Horrible! This should be removed as a recipe! You will throw this away as it's wayyyyyy toooooo salty. You won't brown at 350 degrees in 20 minutes and you won't carmelize at 350 in 20 minutes. It's done in 2 hours as well.
2002035115,501742,2018/3/7,0,These are the best country ribs. For those complaining about too much salt use garlic powder instead of garlic salt &amp; reduce the amount of seasoned salt.
2002202472,501742,2018/6/30,3,Looked and smelled amazing! I had to leave out some spices due to dietary restrictions. Had trouble getting the initial browning and it wasn't very tender. May try again but I'll tenderize the ribs first and add bbq sauce the last 20 min instead. I went very light on the salt and pepper so no salty taste to mine.
2002248165,501742,2018/8/15,3,"I tried this according to this recipe. The pork didn't brown in 20 min at 350 but I still finished making this according to the directions. After adding BBQ sauce and another 20 min at 350 there was no caramelization at all. Covered tightly and baked at 250 for 2 hours. Pork was tender but seems most of the moisture came out and was in the pan, there was a tight seal with the foil so none was lost to the oven. All in all not to bad. I found a better way that worked great. Heat your grill to high sprinkle with Cajun spices, brown for about 5 min on high to sear in juice on all sides, lightly paint a thin layer of bbq sauce then only keep on grill until you can see the sauce getting thick, a few min. Then put in pan or casserole dish and cover tightly with foil, cook at 250 for 2 hours. They came out perfect, I think the key to keep the moisture in was to seer on a hot grill."
316094,515841,2015/1/11,5,"I wanted to make a light dinner using chicken as my protein, and this fit the bill perfectly!  The mushroom salad was bright and citrusy, and the garlic made it smell divine.  The chicken cooked perfectly and was nice and moist, although I ended up moving the oven rack closer to the broiler because things weren&#039;t browning fast enough.  All in all, though, it was a quick and delicious dinner!"
2847415,499202,2013/6/1,1,"Let me just say: Great. Big. Mess. Not happy. I had my tummy all set on a sweet, light, fluffy, slice of tropical cloud. Huge disappointment! I almost cried. If you insist on making this atrocity, please, reduce the sour cream to one cup (instead of two)."
1052873,503349,2018/12/9,4,Easy to prepare except I had a lot of trouble with the eggs. I had to turn them over to set.
2686575,494767,2013/2/10,5,absolutely wonderful
1925885,504105,2013/8/8,5,"Very spicy and very good!  I made these exactly as stated, using habaneros and scotch bonnets - the most common chiles here.  The only optional ingredient I added is a pinch of oregano.  Made for team Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
204024,504105,2013/8/11,5,Great combination of flavors and really fun to make.  I used the peppers listed plus yellow peppers and serranos.  Made for ZWT9 for Hot Stuff.
369566,504105,2013/8/24,5,"My neighbor gave me a small bunch of mixed hot peppers from her garden and this was such an easy way to use them!  When we vacationed in Puerto Rico, we had this served with every breakfast and loved it; this bring us back there.  I&#039;m going to make some good rice and beans to enjoy with it!"
2000236604,504105,2015/10/30,5,"This easy  and quick recipe was  just  what I was looking for to use the abundance of habaneros from my garden. Better yet the apple cider vinegar complements the flavor of the pepper while calming the intense heat. I love the flavor of the habanero , but one must be cautious with the heat! I used the basic recipe and stuffed as many peppers that would fit into the container and have aged it for a month, and it is perfect!"
1722110,504105,2017/5/15,0,"While this is a lovely hot sauce recipe, this is NOT Puerto Rican style pique, perhaps a general caribbean hot sauce but not puerto rican . Certainly every family has a slight variation, including my own family, but we puertorrique&ntilde;os don't use cider vinegar (that's a recent trend resulting from all the cider vinegar miracle cure hype) lime juice, bay leaf or cumin when making a traditional pique. A more authentic puerto rican pique is made with white vinegar (which doesn't alter the flavor but rather blends the flavors of the ingredients), fresh pineapple pieces or pineapple juice if pieces are not available (this adds to the unique flavor of pique puertorrique&ntilde;o that is not achieved with cider vinegar), aji caballero (a VERY traditional very hot pepper used by boricua's), recao leaves, cilantro, and oregano (adds to the flavor of cooking puertorrique&ntilde;o), and olive oil (because we love it!) are added to the remaining ingredients above. Some of us will take a few peppers and smash them, with the seeds, in a mortar and pestle before adding into the bottle with the whole or sliced peppers. And we don't top off our pique when it begins to run low, we make a fresh batch using the pique previously made (similar concept to sour mash). Why would we cheat ourselves in such a way?!?!"
65502,503613,2013/7/16,5,"Oh my goodness, this was good!! The sauce is very flavourful and would be great with any protein, even a meatier fish like halibut or salmon. I made half the amount of the sauce and it was enough for us. I should have only put one of the &quot;meatballs&quot; on each skewer because it was virtually impossible to turn two of them at the same time. Most of them fell apart but the taste was really great. They were spicy but not too strong and paired so well with the remoulade sauce. We enjoyed these with a fresh salad and some grilled garlic toast. Made for The Tasty Testers. Thanks loof! :)"
145352,503613,2013/7/21,5,"Oh my!!!! These were soooo good!!!! I wasn&#039;t sure I&#039;d like the sauce, but it went so well with the meatballs. They were so tasty too! They would make a great burger! I used Thai chili sauce and it gave the sauce quite a kick! Made for ZWT 9."
226863,503613,2014/4/10,5,"Amazing!  The taste is absolutely devine!  I cooked mine on a charcoal grill, and had a hard time turning them.  They really wanted to stick, but I persevered and enjoyed a wonderful dinner!  This will be a definite repeat, absolutely wonderful flavor!  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
1243137,512893,2014/2/11,4,OMG! This was Awesome-It tastes like a Big Mac on a pizza crust! Followed recipe exactly using my own homemade crust and everyone loved it. The only thing I will do different next time is make more sauce because i like things really saucy. It was also great warmed up for lunch the next day!
461834,506838,2014/10/30,5,"Just loved this all in one pan meal!!  It brought back childhood memories of my Mom making a dinner similar to this dish, but it was in separate pans.  Recently I had found a double pack (at Walmart) of skinless smoked sausage, so that is what I changed in the recipe, but otherwise made as written.  I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet, so did add some oil.  Thanks for sharing this recipe which I will make again.  Congrats on another win in the football pool!!"
226863,506838,2014/10/31,5,Loved this!  It would be perfect for breakfast too!  I have to admit I didn&#039;t use turkey sausage....I used Conecuh Smoked Sausage as that is our favorite.  All I can say is that try to stick to 2 servings....cooking more makes it hard to brown the potatoes.  This is delicious....even without any added salt or seasonings.  Just delicious...I&#039;ll make this often.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for your win in football pool at Yuku.
305531,506838,2014/12/6,5,What a great dinner. This was easy to make and very tasty. I used German sausage and had a spicy mustard and horseradish on the side to dip the sausage into. We&#039;ll have this again soon. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Congrats on another win in the football pool!
1098582,506142,2013/11/13,5,"This was 100% awesome!  It is exactly what I hoped it would be.  I did eat the bread because I was on my &#039;cheat day&#039; from low carb.  I will make this without the bread for a great low carb meal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My awesome 11 year-old daughter is getting into cooking and she liked this.  She is a picky eater and she actually ate some the next day for leftovers.  Her comments were to put the tomatoes in a food processor because she wanted sauce.  Wouldn&#039;t be bruschetta without the texture, but I love that she was thinking about- says a lot about the flavor!"
220348,503346,2013/8/22,5,"This was so awesome! I didn&#039;t think olives and chicken would go together, but in this recipe, it did! And the spices were not overpowering either."
383346,494105,2013/4/9,5,These pancakes have a wonderful taste.  The texture was perfect.  They&#039;re moist and were great with maple syrup.  Thanks Roberts :)  Made for PAC Spring 2013

37636,494105,2015/2/3,5,"These pancakes are very good! I counted out 14 pancakes (from 1/4c batter ea), although these are the thin type. I don&#039;t think they exactly match IHOP in flavor. I think those have slightly more of a creamy tang to them. But these are still delish. Makes for an all too easy breakfast which I served with sausage links (which I precooked, froze and then just nuked), so perfect for me to get together on  a workday/schoolday. Thanks for sharing!"
305531,494105,2015/2/10,5,So yummy. They were thinner than I expected but that&#039;s ok - I just ate more of them. lol. Thanks for sharing. Made for Best of 2014 tag.
482376,494105,2015/3/8,5,"Great pancakes! The recipe made about 12 flavorful pancakes. I found that I needed to cook them at a lower temperature than I usually do for pancakes, because they brown up very quickly. Great flavor. Thank you!"
2549237,499437,2013/5/10,5,"This was really good!  I used a 2 pound pork loin roast and pre-sliced the meat before marinating it, but followed the recipe to a T besides that.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to double the sauce.  We like our fried rice a little bit sloppy.  Thank you for a great easy meal JLTaylor04.

2001361486,502859,2017/1/22,5,Amazing! We added 1/2 cup shredded Parmigiana Cheese to the sauce before adding the pasta. De-lish!
328048,502859,2013/7/18,4,"I made this as written with the addition of salmon, diced tomatoes, and zucchini to turn it into a one pot meal. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much but the flavor of the sauce sort of overpowered the salmon, which I wasn&#039;t expecting. I&#039;ll have to try it again sometime plain, but even with the salmon, it&#039;ll be in our rotation now. Thanks!"
163112,502859,2013/7/20,5,"Delicious!  I used 1c plain full fat yogurt &amp; 1c half &amp; half because I found out too late that I was out of cream!  Grr.  It worked wonderfully!  Be careful using both cajun seasoning &amp; salt - my seasoning mix has salt in it &amp; if I had used both, it would be too salty.  Plus I used chicken broth (has salt) and the parm has salt.  So I didn&#039;t add salt.  ;)  We loved this &amp; will definitely make it again.  Made for ZWT9 for Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers!"
318262,502859,2013/7/22,5,This was really really great! I loved the diff take on a cream sauce. The only change I made was to mix in some veggies at the end for a more complete meal.
169430,502859,2013/7/27,5,"Great combo of flavors. Kudo&#039;s to Elmo for mentioning the salt ratio, she&#039;s right on and I&#039;m glad that I didn&#039;t add any. That said this was a marvelous way to say so long the the Cajun region od ZWT 9. Mike, you have many excellent recipes and I always enjoy them, this was no exception. The creamy spice sauce is tops and a very welcome change from the usual. It really perks up the pasta (I used a wide linguini). Thanks for another winner. :D"
461834,502859,2013/9/13,5,"Yummy pasta, loved the little zing you get from the Cajun seasoning!!  I was worried that it would be too much of a tomato flavor, it really wasn&#039;t, but it looked like it was a tomato based recipe.  I also always worry that it maybe too spicy for me, but, again, it worked for my tastes/heat.  This was a new awesome experience for me to enjoy the taste of the South/New Orleans, what awesome foods I have been missing!!!  I used Emeril&#039;s Essence for the seasoning and cut the recipe back to one serving(using mini penne pasta)  for DH and I, which worked out to be more then enough for us.  But we also had grilled garlic bread, yummy Cuban marinated grilled chicken and a salad.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!  Made for your win in the football pool, congrats!!!"
305531,502859,2013/9/15,5,"Yum! I made this as directed and loved it. As others have mentioned, I can see lots of things to add to this. Chicken, andouille, mushrooms and any other kind of veggie comes to mind. It was yummy as is but I think I&#039;m going to try different variations each time I make it again. Thanks Mikekey for a nice winner. Made for your win in the football pool. Congrats again!"
381180,502859,2014/2/6,5,"Quick and easy, and quite tasty!  I thought the smoked paprika was a nice addition to the sauce.  I used mini bow tie pasta, and added shrimp.  Tagged for Best of 2013 on 01/23, due 02/06/14."
1802540385,502859,2014/3/1,5,"Love this recipe! I had family over and served this...everyone LOVED it! I used Bowtie pasta and added shrimp at the end. We all like our food spicy, so I added some cayenne pepper, just to heat it up a little! Served with a salad and bread, perfect, quick and easy meal! And leftovers taste just as good!!! *takes a bite*"
323186,502859,2014/4/4,5,"Cant go wrong with this recipe,  excellent, we loved it, could have this every night! I used linguini as per my husbands preference, but confess that I think a short pasta, penne or similar, would be a better choice.  You could add shrimp or bacon or ... lots of stuff -- but it was great as was!   Thank you, made for I Recommend tag game."
2001349221,502859,2017/1/13,5,"I recently went to a nice restaurant and ordered the seafood cajun pasta. It looked delicious, but I was so unimpressed with the flavor. I had to add lots of salt and pepper to make it taste better. I decided that I would try to make my own and found this recipe for the sauce. My family loved it! I added crawfish, shrimp, sausage, and crab meat with a penne pasta. I will definitely be making this sauce again. Thanks for sharing!"
2001569685,502859,2017/6/5,5,"I just made this, I used crab meat and sliced up some chicken tenders, this was amazing, I used to order this at a cajun place years ago, and this is just as good, or even better, I also used a little butter with the olive oil. Make this dish, you will not be sorry."
2001957550,502859,2018/1/27,5,"This recipe was the BOMB!! I added shrimp, Cajun andoulie sausage and red bell pepper to the sauce and used penne pasta. It was sooo good! I was requested by my family to make this again as a dish for the superbowl next Sunday!!"
2002120360,502859,2018/5/2,5,"This is soooo much BETTER than the restaurant version i made it with shrimp,spicy smoked sausage and chicken.Sooo GOOD! A must TRY recipe guys you will not be dissapointed! :)"
80353,495333,2013/3/2,3,"This was quite good but not as successful with my kids (my prime sloppy joe market) as I had hoped.  The 'wet' ingredients turned into a very sweet and overpowering flavour combo that I feel overwhelmed the beef.  Also, there was not as much 'sauce' as we normally like in our sloppy joe mix.  Lastly, I think we would have enjoyed it more if the cheese had been added towards the end of the cooking time, by the time it finished cooking, the texture was just weird but that may be the cheese I had to use (cheese slices) as Velveeta isn't available."
131126,495333,2013/3/2,3,"I liked the ease of the recipe and thought the idea creative. I thought the inclusion of pickle relish was also an inventive touch.  That said, we were disappointed with the recipe. :-( <br/>The result tasted more like a ""cheeseburger"" than sloppy joes; so much so that we felt the only similarity was the texture of the meat.  The dish was very cheesy and pale yellow in color.  The recipe doesn't specify sweet or dill relish. I used the dill and unsweetened applesauce which probably contributed to my wanting a little sweetness in the dish.  The cooking times were spot on.  Served on buns along with slaw and cob corn.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!"
39835,509481,2014/2/14,4,Very good dish. As there are only two of us I cut the amount of vegetables in half but used the full amount of everything else. Made as directed but used rice noodles (and I am not sure if that is the same thing as suggested in the ingredients). Thanks for sharing!
2001336778,511844,2017/1/4,5,"Hands down one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life! I was crying when it came down to the last piece. I've recommended it to all my friends. This is what heaven tastes like so don't walk, run and make it!"
1800055246,499587,2013/9/11,5,"This is a very tasty dish.  I don&#039;t used canned beans so I put 2/3 cup dry lentils and 2/3 cup small red beans in my pressure cooker with 4 cups of water and cooked for 15 minutes.  After the beans came to pressure, I continued the recipe from the top.  It turned out fabulous!  The yogurt is optional as I forgot to add it at the end and never missed it."
1179225,499587,2014/1/9,4,"A tasty, simple way to prepare lentils. I was looking for a copy cat recipe for the lentils madras that Costco sells. This is similar, but was lacking  some depth of flavor. I ended up adding some nutritional yeast diluted in water, about a 1/4 t. of corriander, tumeric and a pinch of cinnamon. I was closer to what I was looking for. But, as is this a tasty recipe, just not quite what I was looking for. Thanks so much for sharing this version."
2000467171,499587,2015/10/12,5,"Before I added the lentils and beans, i blended it after it cooked, then put in back on the stove with t he lentils and beans for a few min, added the cream and a little butter. Poured over rice. So YUM!"
2001236385,499587,2016/11/7,0,"Hello, I don't understand what the last ingredient means...&quot;1/4 cup cream, substitute&quot; The word &quot;substitute&quot; is throwing me. Substitute cream with something else?"
2856126,494283,2013/6/8,1,"This recipe when done as it is written, makes a dry, unflexible tortilla.  After the first one, and discovering this, I quickly rolled the next 3 balls in coconut oil.  They came out more flexible, but not as much as I was hoping for.  I am new at making tortilla&#039;s, and I was disappointed in this recipe&#039;s directions and taste.   I love the Wheat Belly books, and I have converted my family to being gluten free after reading the book.  I have been looking for a replacement tortilla for my husband, and I will continue to look after this attempt.  Maybe I could find one that gives an oil as an ingredient, and give this one a try again, adding the correct amount of oil to it to make it more flexible."
2000845643,494283,2016/1/30,0,Add 1 Tbsp coconut oil melted and 1 Tbsp water for every egg ou use...this will yeild a softer tortilla.
480195,500409,2013/9/6,5,We really enjoyed these eggs for breakfast. I will be making them again soon. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
157167,503682,2013/7/15,5,"These were great little fried pancakes!  They reminded me of beineights.  I tried one fresh out of the pan, and then waited to eat until I had cooked all the batter and fed everyone else - they are MUCH better warm.  I got 25 little petoules, which made a full breakfast for 3 people (since they are so small.)  They really don&#039;t take any time to cook, by the time I had spooned 5 cakes into the pan I needed to flip the first one.  For ZWT9"

These were very interesting; ours came out a bit like small crepes, flavor and thickness-wise. We doused them with all available condiments recommended. They really did make for a nice breakfast, and I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be enjoying them again. Thanks for sharing, diner524!"
128473,503682,2013/7/26,5,"Mmmmm, I love pancakes and these tiny honey pancakes were wonderful.  Quick, easy to make, with ingredients found in the pantry.  Perfect served warm with cinnamon, icing sugar and a little honey.  They really do remind one of beigenets.  Wow, were they the bomb...so tasty.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will make again often.  Made for ZWT9."
895132,501382,2014/4/10,4,"I&#039;m not totally sure how to rate this. It was filling and tasted okay, but actually not something that I would make again. It *did* fill me up nicely, though, so it definitely worked, and that&#039;s why I rate it four stars :) Maybe it depends on the kind of tea you use and the fruit. I used lemon grass tea and frozen mango, but overall, I think I don&#039;t care for the tea in it. Thanks none the less for an interesting smoothie experience :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for Spring PAC 2014"
1072593,531164,2017/8/15,5,Wait a minute! Skillet Margarita Pizza? What in the name of piquant sauces and full-fat cheese is THAT all about?! I'm thinking it's just about time for a another lunch break.
226863,508029,2014/4/20,5,I really loved these!  I think my favorite was the beef broth!  It added a lot of depth to the peas.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game.
163112,508029,2014/9/26,5,Oh yes.  I love pancetta.  I was very happy to find Boar&#039;s Head sells wee packets (4oz) of chopped pancetta.  Makes the dish just that much easier!  We all loved this.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ.
381180,503929,2014/11/24,5,"Loved it!  Not as spicy as I expected, but the hot sauce added the needed kick!  Served on Sue Lau&#039;s Soft White Bread ABM recipe on Zaaz!"
865936,513941,2014/3/14,4,"What a great option for those that love spicy chicken wings, but have chosen to eat more (or all) vegetables!  I made the glaze with mango fruit spread and found the addition of the sriracha it just a teensy bit too hot for my taste.  I just added a touch of sugar and a small squirt of ketchup and that calmed it down but not too much.  Cauliflower is just so versatile.  Made for PRMR tag game."
542159,503278,2013/8/19,5,Nice any time of the day meal! We both thought the Mexican chilies add a nice new twist to this great traditional dish. Thanks for the post.
2001745369,531683,2017/10/8,1,I would give this zero stars if I could. This was the WORST rice pudding I have ever made. Unfortunately I was making it to send to my friend’s mom who was in the hospital and could only eat bland food. It was gummy and just awful!
37449,504273,2013/8/16,4,This was a different way to use my cauliflower. I liked the crunch and the flavor. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013.
2000384126,533188,2018/1/29,0,Looking for ward to trying this in the next breakfast day.
37449,502568,2013/8/16,5,Yummy breakfast yesterday! I liked all the spices and this hit the spot! Thanks!
174096,502568,2013/9/2,5,"Delightful!  Lots of flavor from all of the spices and garlic mixture, and the tomato sauce was rich with the use of tomato paste.  The eggs came out perfectly cooked and were a perfect pairing.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
157167,522889,2015/7/30,4,"This was a great, easy breakfast.  I made a ingle serving (1/3 recipe) in a ramekin, and it took 15 minutes for the eggs to set.  I also added a little more salt and some regular pepper.  For Culinary Quest Munching Minions :)"
226867,522889,2015/8/2,4,"I made half the recipe and used gruyere cheese. It took a lot longer than 15 min. to cook - around 20 or a little more. Tasty and easy, would be great in winter when you want to warm the house a little extra!"
47892,522889,2015/8/3,4,"Version #1 was made as written. For Version #2 I whisked the ingredients together and poured the mixture into buttered ramekins.  This version took only 15 minutes to bake whereas #1 took closer to 25 minutes. I switched brown mustard for mustard powder, skipped the salt and substitute paprika for cayenne. Very easy to make and great flavor! Prepared for CQ 2015."
305531,522889,2015/8/3,5,I really enjoyed this recipe. I cooked 2 eggs in a small baking dish and it took about 20 minutes for the eggs to set. The hardest part of this recipe is getting the eggs out of the baking dish. lol. Thanks for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2.
37636,522889,2015/8/4,5,"I cut this recipe back to 2 eggs since it was just for me and put it in a round small buttered souffle dish. Eggs at 20 minutes had firmed  whites and soft set yolk.  Easy to get out of the pan- I loosened the edges and slid it onto a plate. If you cook all of them in the larger pan it might be more difficult. There was probably too much butter dots for the top, I would cut that back by about half, and the salt seemed heavy- I&#039;d cut it back too, but that&#039;s just me (I try to use less salt and fat). Otherwise this cooked up just fine. Thanks, and made for 2015 Culinary Quest."
482376,522889,2015/8/5,5,"I made this for my son this morning and he really enjoyed it. 20 minutes seemed to be the right amount of time. The melted cheese was wonderful. Next time, I would cut back a little on the salt and mustard. Made for Culinart Quest 2015 - Switzerland."

530915,494438,2014/3/17,5,"I have made this two weeks in a row, last weekend being a double batch and they quickly disappear, and I actually heard moans of joy when friends bit into it.  I have been offered an entire daytrip sailing for free as long as I bring these along! Really amazing!  thanks so much for sharing!"
37449,503212,2013/9/5,5,I scaled the recipe down to 2 eggs and really enjoyed all the veggies! I forgot to put in the cheese and it was still good. :D Made for ZWT 2013 Family Picks.
145352,503412,2013/7/17,5,"This was soooo good!!! Had a house full of young men, and they said it was awesome!!! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Made for ZWT 9."
482376,503412,2013/8/27,5,"Simple and delicious! I doubled the recipe, using all drumsticks, and it worked out really well. I loved the thick, lemony sauce. Yum! Made for Zingo ZWT9 for the Soup-A-Stars. Thank you!"
1706426,503412,2013/8/29,5,"Loved this! We devoured it so fast I didn&#039;t have time to take a photo, but will next time! Made for ZWT9"
47559,505279,2013/9/2,4,"I trimmed off the tenderloin side of two large porterhouse steaks, cubed them and used that for the meat.  It was slightly under a pound.  I used the full amount of marinade ingredients, and in retrospect should have reduced the salt somewhat because it was a bit salty.  I allowed the meat to marinade for about 4 hours and the flavors came through nicely.  It came together very quickly and was an easy and tasty meal.  Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers, ZWT9."
128473,505279,2014/6/2,5,"We really enjoyed this tasty dish.  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  I used a nice sirlion steak, it worked great in the stir fry.   Wow, what flavor Bethie.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, its really good.  Quick and easy to make with lovely results.  I marinaded the steak mixture for 10 hours, it was wonderful.  Served with Jasmin Rice, tomato wedges and garnished with green onions."
2000721307,524927,2015/12/1,5,"My husband and I love this chili! I added a little extra chili powder/cumin, and espresso instead of regular coffee."
2002277099,536305,2018/10/1,0,"My question is the same as Christine G. If you're using only 1/2 of the blueberry sauce in the recipe, and putting whole blueberries on top, what do you do with the other half of the sauce?"
480195,503801,2013/8/4,5,"This was very tasty. It was served as part of a Scandinavian buffet and finished, which is always a good sign. I will make it again, maybe adding a little Dijon or even coarse mustard and serve it over chicken breast. Thanks for a versatile recipe."
2001213199,528652,2016/10/20,0,Trying this right now and I'd just like to know how you handled the mints while hot. I'm already feeling the burn!
2000938801,521821,2016/3/28,5,"Third attempt:

This recipe works really well. I have tried it with left-over bqq chicken and boiled ham in addition to the bacon in the original recipe; all equally good.
Last time I turned it into a penne pasta bake and sprinkled it with mozzarella and parmesan. Yummy."
58439,504779,2013/10/15,4,"When you want a quick Thermomix dip for entertaining or on sandwiches and pizzas, easy to do!&lt;br/&gt;Did I mention is VERY tasty! Is a keeper! Thank you!"
1802737240,492718,2015/4/12,5,"This is my husband&#039;s all-time favorite breakfast. I made it two weekends in a row, it is that good. I followed directions exactly, including the attached recipe for the black-eyes pea salsa. A+ breakfast for spicy-food lovers!"
47892,492718,2016/1/13,5,This one hit the spot! I bought two tamales (pork) at a local Mexican market for this recipe and made a quick &#039;Cowboy Caviar&#039;. I also subbed half of the cheddar cheese with cotija and homemade crema mexicana in place of sour cream. A definite winner in our household! Prepared for Holiday Hits. 2015-2016.
199848,505594,2013/9/11,5,"These are some really great lentils!   They are nicely spiced without being overpowering.  Easy and healthy, too.  This works as a side or a thick soup.  Thanx for posting!"
2000382876,521585,2017/1/25,0,Made as is and was great!
2324285,504140,2013/7/21,5,"A great meal!  I have to say though, this makes a LOT of quinoa.  We were more full than usual after dinner- next time I&#039;ll use half the amount.  The spice blend on the chicken was great, and it turned out perfectly moist.  I&#039;ve made avocado cream like this before, and it&#039;s always a great addition.  I also topped the quinoa with a generous amount of homemade pico de gallo, and it really brought all the flavors together.  Thanks for sharing!"
37449,504432,2013/8/16,5,"Delicious!  I must admit, I skipped baking the eggs and just put them in the frying pan on top of the tomato mixture and the greens. Yum! Made for ZWT 2013 by one of the Hot Stuff."
220348,504432,2013/8/17,5,"This reminds me of growing up, and having something warm and out of the ordinary. I left the sauce in the skillet, and cracked the eggs over the sauce. I really do love the addition of the kale; I never had it before in my Shakshuka, but it added something nice to it. And it made for a filling breakfast, allowing me to get through the morning, without having to snack on anything."
107135,504432,2013/8/24,5,i loved this very flavorful  cooked in skillet zwt9
227978,536063,2018/7/10,5,"This was a wonderful snack. It's pretty easy to make, too. I have never made it before, so this was a new experience for me. Thanks, sheepdoc. Made for SWT 2018 (Malta)."
1925885,536063,2018/7/23,5,"Delish! I love Halva and had I known how easy it is to make, I would have it more often! This is so tasty - but I think you need to use a good Tahini from a Mediterranean store (which I luckily had in the pantry!). Next time, I think I'll try flavoring half with cocoa and make a swirled Halva. Yum! Made for SWT 2018. Team Incredibles."
169430,511060,2013/12/26,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this on Christmas day. Made it with vanilla almond milk and used Splenda for a delightful and guilt free drink and I would enjoy at any time of the year. Thanks Sharon :D
400708,508912,2014/4/28,4,"A fresh, lite dressing for a Spring salad with a nice blend of different vinegars and spices.  Wondering how it would be with a tablespoon of balsamic added to it, might give that a try next time, and maybe a little big of garlic.  But good just as it is too.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
136997,508912,2014/5/2,5,"A bit tangy, but very nice on our mixed green salad. Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2014 Event."
227978,513180,2014/4/23,4,"I thought this was quite good, ladyknightscot.  It did taste similar to my mom&#039;s recipe for Cabbage Rolls, but most of my family thought it could benefit from a little more seasoning.  I think the next time I make this, I&#039;ll start by adding a little chopped green pepper or perhaps chopped celery, just for a little extra taste and color.  Made for the Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef event."
2278121,513445,2018/2/12,5,I loved this recipe!!!!
1803088290,501118,2014/8/31,1,I made this last night. It did not turn out at all. The fruit were all hard. I used fresh fruit too.
145352,503972,2013/7/14,5,"Great side dish!!!! The recipe makes a lot, so I&#039;m gonna have leftovers for lunch this week. I&#039;m excited! I added just a touch of olive oil when mixing, and some salt and pepper to taste. Yum! Made for ZWT9."
114027,503972,2013/7/27,5,"Loved this! I left out the mushrooms for my own taste, but did everything else as written. I the blend of herbs was perfect with the veggies and a little olive oil. Made for The Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT 9."
362499,493131,2013/1/7,5,A fabulous use of pea protein and chia seeds.  Delicious and filling.  I sprinkled a little cinnamon on it all and used almond milk.
2731384,497016,2013/3/10,5,I would have used some sort of breading on the outside of the steaks but I guess there wasn't enough ingredients. Kids really liked having their own individual roll ups and gravy.
2725770,497016,2013/3/11,5,sounds simple and yummy!  bet you could do it with chicken breast pounded thin.
401767,503355,2018/9/4,5,Great way to make small batches of sugar-nectar for small feeders! Perfect for Northerners in Spring who want to put small feeders out early and are not sure quite when their little guests will be arriving. Much less waste than filling and putting out a large feeder early in the season while awaiting their arrival. Thanks for posting such a helpful recipe!
1800113340,502571,2013/10/12,5,The best cupcakes I have ever made. I substituted some of the buttermilk with eggnog in the frosting and it added the perfect touch. I will definitely make these again.
2211242,496573,2013/3/16,5,easy and delicious
865936,503023,2013/8/29,4,"The saucesis really nice and full of flavor.  I wound up choosing to cook pork chunks in it, so added a little water as it was cooking because it was a tough pork shoulder.  I added in some cauliflower and red onions.  Once it was done it needed more oomph.  I just drizzled in a little more if the curry sauce!"
2420655,496573,2013/3/14,5,I thought these tasted even better than I thought they would!

2742283,496573,2013/3/18,5,You put all of my favorites into one delicious bite. Love the crispy panko. This is definitely a keeper and one to pass along.

2000727246,524984,2015/12/4,5,great
498271,503770,2013/8/17,5,"Great sweet/tart salad!  I used less oil; I don&#039;t care for raw onion so used parsley instead.  The salty/tangy dressing was great with the fruits.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
136997,503770,2014/3/2,4,Very crisp and refreshing. I will omit the onions next time. I felt they overpowered the salad just a bit. Made for Everyday Holiday Tag game.
865936,503770,2016/8/9,5,I liked this salad very well even though it is a bit on the sweet side. Next time I would add MORE green onions to contrast with the sweet fruit.
131126,503770,2016/8/12,5,The mix of sweet &amp; savory elements caught my eye &amp; I'm glad it did. I used a smaller pineapple so reduced the other ingredients to match. I liked dressing although I would reduce the oil a bit next time. I served this with grilled chicken breasts and the leftovers with sandwiches the next day. I will make this again.
606850,521756,2017/11/28,5,"This was delicious! However, I have some notes for myself for later! First, keep an eye on it before it starts to simmer, because it will boil over *very quickly*! Also, don't let it sit in the pan, even with the burner off ... or it will continue to cook, and pass from &quot;syrup&quot; to &quot;hard candy&quot; (or even burnt). Fantastic taste!"
280271,503265,2013/7/25,5,We loved this spicy/sweet salad...it&#039;s so refreshing on a hot summer day! I can see it being doubled or tripled for those who have lots to feed...but for hubby and me...it was just perfect...I served it as a side...but next time I think I will throw in some cooked shrimp to let them marinade along with the other ingredients for a nice lunch dish...this is a keeper...thanks for posting it...=)
461834,503265,2013/8/18,5,"What a wonderful salad and a nice change from our normal cucumber salad!!!  I made this as written, but scaled back for just the two of us.  This is so similar to ours for the first 6 ingredients, except we use apple cider vinegar and no sugar.  We enjoyed the slightly sweet heat to the cucumbers!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
364211,499684,2013/11/19,5,"Delicious! Very nice recipe for couscous.  I really enjoyed the fresh asparagus in this dish.  The nuts were omitted for preference.  I have tried couscous a couple of times before, but wasn&#039;t very fond of it.  Pammy didn&#039;t mention when to add the garlic, I just threw it in in the last minute of toasting the couscous.  Glad you shared this recipe and glad I found it!  Made in your memory, Pammy.  RIP"
169430,512461,2014/1/23,5,"If you enjoy white chocolate you will surely enjoy this. I used fat free liquid coffee creamer for the cream (saved some calories and fat there). Loved the cardamom and vanilla, I added 1/2 a tsp of vanilla. Great comfort drink for sitting with a good book on a snowy afternoon and just enjoying life for awhile."
128473,512461,2014/2/16,5,"I adore hot chocolate and I also love cardamom.  This recipe was tailor made for me.  So delicious, rich, thick, decadent and velvety.  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  I did add some cardamom whipped cream as garnish.  (it had the same spices, so I knew that it would compliment the hot chocolate).  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe, which I have placed in Best of 2014 Cookbook. kudos to you!"
47892,494466,2013/4/27,0,"We served this bread with kofta and a side salad. Although not traditional, we liked&lt;br/&gt;the bread slices dunked in that lovely olive oil/balsamic mixture! I cut the recipe in half. The texture was interesting. At least it was a lab experiment that didn&#039;t go horribly wrong. Made for NA*ME March/April."
157167,503658,2013/7/23,5,"This was excellent, and reminded me of a New Orleans poboy :)  I threw the gravy ingredients in the crock pot with a sliced roast, which made both preparation and cleanup quite simple.  For ZWT9"
131126,504555,2016/8/2,5,"The chicken strips were excellent and honestly would fit the bill for most palates. There isn't the jerk or curry flavors one would associate with the Caribbean. They fried up crispy, crunchy, and wonderfully browned. I appreciated the posters excellent step by step instructions. Great job! Made for the Culinary Quest 2016."
92006,504555,2016/8/5,5,These were great! My kids especially loved them with bbq sauce. Thank you! Made for CQ '16.
2001141120,503658,2016/8/25,5,"Yup this IS it! Nice dark rich debris gravy. Taste just like my MIL roast beef. She's from Bayou Vista La and knows her food. Nolacuisine has awesome recipes. I made his redbeans&amp;rice. My FIL told me &quot;girl don't change a thing, taste just like in Nawlins, dem some good beans&quot;."
328467,503658,2017/2/11,4,"This gets 4 stars as written, but with the slight mods I made the second time this was SPECTACULAR. Use only beef broth (low sodium or so salt added - the worcestershire is salty enough). This needs a 'meaty' broth so don't bother with chicken broth, it's adds zero flavour. Use 4 cups beef broth instead of 2 otherwise it will dry up. While it's cooking (I cooked mine in the oven at 300 degrees F), make a proper deep brown roux. It takes at least an hour on a very low simmer. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup flour, stir frequently until it's chocolatey brown. When the roast is finished cooking, add debris gravy to the roux plus the extra beef broth - this makes outstanding gravy."
1925885,502948,2013/8/15,4,"Mmmmmm!  The house smelled so GOOD while this was cooking!  The blend of spices was amazing and the result was very flavorful.  This recipe is definitely a keeper - it was so easy to make. But in the future, we will probably increase the spice mix by 50% - not that the dish was bland, but for our taste we would like a bit more punch.  Served this with Mikekey&#039;s Recipe#505110... wonderful!  Thanks for posting a great recipe!  Made for team Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
498271,502948,2013/8/23,5,"Wow - this is absolutely delicious!  I used about half the chicken called for and took the suggestion of another reviewer and doubled the spices (except the salt).  Smelled amazing while cooking and came out with a rich, hearty, flavorful meal.  As expected, leftovers were terrific as well.  Thanks for sharing a keeper!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
286566,502948,2014/3/1,3,"This didn&#039;t fare well for us I did omit the onion and salt for dietary reasons or otherwise made as per recipe but allowed 4 to 6 hours for cooking in my crock pot at the 4 hour mark the chicken was cooked nicely but the vegies were still hard and by the 5 hour mark the vegies were perfect but the chicken had become dry and even though the dish smelt wonderful the flavours did not come out in the taste, therefore if making again I would use skinless thigh and add more spices, thank you ElizabethKnicely, made for Best of 2013 and recommended by loof."
2324285,502948,2014/4/10,5,"Very tasty and easy to make.  I cooked everything on low for 8 hours, so the flavors could really work their magic.  I also doubled the spices, and it came out just right.  This one is a keeper, for sure."
1277527,506665,2013/9/15,5,"Had 2 portions with a salad for lunch, it was delicious !!"
2000736824,524984,2015/12/9,5,Looks amazing! Cannot wait to make it
2549237,505776,2013/8/20,5,"This was so easy and so good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only thing I did differently was to use chicken quarters and regular raisins, simply because that is what I had on hand.  I served this over couscous as you suggested and we had a wonderful dinner.  We really loved the spicy sweet flavor that came through in this dish.  Thank you for another great and delicious meal Nif.  Made for the African round of ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers."
334010,505776,2013/8/23,5,Very Tasty! I don&#039;t like most Moroccan food as I feel like it is an overload of cinnamon... but this was perfectly seasoned.
329769,505776,2013/8/24,4,Made as written for ZWT9. This made a lovely family dinner and was enjoyed by all - including my youngest that doesn&#039;t like spicy foods
114027,505776,2013/8/26,5,"This recipe turned out great! Loved the flavors from all of the spices. This wasn&#039;t too spicy, but could easily be adjusted to make it spicier if you like. Made for the Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT9."
2153704,524984,2015/12/10,5,Looks delish!!!! Making this tonight:)))
2674422,494323,2013/2/3,5,Extremely unique recipe and FULL of flavor! My taste buds were in overdrive! Highly recommended!
266635,494323,2013/5/11,5,"This is delicious shrimp cocktail.  I was fortunate to find some tequila-lime (cooked) shrimp at the Whole Foods Market and they really complimented this sauce.  The only changes I made was to leave out the corn and add a bit of prepared horseradish to the sauce. I halved the recipe since it was just DH and I and he absolutely loved it.  Made for PRMR, May, 2013."
174096,503889,2013/7/21,5,"Delicious!  This is filling and flavorful, with a nice kick!  I did reduce the quantity of sausage, egg, and cheese a bit for the two of us, and we still had plenty.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
305531,503889,2013/9/3,5,"Yum. I halved the recipe for 2 of us and we devoured it. As Starrynews already said, this was filling and flavorful. Thanks for sharing. Made for ZWT9."
131721,507167,2014/1/2,5,"This was easy to make, and everyone loved it!"
1803116455,518230,2014/9/10,5,This is quickly becoming one of my favorite recipes on Food.com. It is a wonderful blend of sweet and savory with the pineapple and A1 marinade. Surprisingly tasty for how healthy it is! I would recommend this dish to anyone and everyone.
2000474316,515476,2015/9/14,5,"I made these brownies as a birthday treat for my son&#039;s kindergarten because I know there are some children with gluten intolerance and the result... mmmmmm delicious. Fist time kidney bean replacent user :)
Thanks for sharing this beauty, I will add it to my list of basics (from which I will start experimenting for more gluten free alternatives!)"
1802590778,515476,2017/1/23,5,This tastes great. More cake like than brownie. I used one can of red kidney beans. I also used 1/2 cup of agave nectar and 1/2 cup of special dark chocolate chips. Increased cocoa from 1/4 to 1/3 cup.
143721,504145,2013/8/14,5,"I made this using a tri-colored couscous that I had, so I measured out 10 ozs of couscous and using the rest of the portions as stated, I followed the directions on the couscous package (simmered for 10 minutes).  I did not add any additional orange juice.  Very nice side dish!    Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;"
1925885,504145,2013/8/16,5,"Loved it!  The flavor was spot on - very subtle, but definitely orangey.  And so simple to make!  Followed the directions exactly as written - boil, stand, fluff. We used Israeli Couscous from Trader Joe&#039;s.  Excellent!  I did end up squeezing the last drops of the orange over the finished couscous and it was delicious!  Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
107583,504145,2013/8/24,5,Ridiculously easy and very tasty!  Great side for a roasted chicken.  Made for ZWT 9.
323186,504145,2013/8/26,5,"Really enjoyed this delicately scented couscous, good flavour too.  Thank you, Ellie, made for ZWT9, Pink Panthers"
482933,504145,2013/9/13,5,Nice recipe. Orange zest dresses it up. I did add juice at end as I wanted to taste orange. Huge recipe. Served with recipe#294925 and recipe#497219
2000599037,507821,2015/10/24,5,This is so easy to make and so very good! Taking to a Halloween party tonight and can&#039;t wait to hear the opinions!
2000551975,505810,2015/10/12,0,This is an excellent recipe. The custard turned out perfectly.
2324285,493522,2013/1/28,4,"The flavor of this dish was really good, but the sauce did not caramelize like it should have.  This was probably because I used a large pan instead of a clay pot or dutch oven.  Really quite tasty though!"
461834,499493,2013/6/1,5,"These are a lot like a pecan sandy!!  I made 1/4 of the recipe and used all butter and did add a pinch of salt.  I ate a few and then had to hide them from myself, lol!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Photo Tag Game."
169430,499493,2014/5/19,5,"I normally save shortbread cookies for Christmas because I just can&#039;t resist them and they are so rich. However, I have yet to try a cookie recipe from this chef that wasn&#039;t a 5 star winner so I just had to go for these. I made a half amount and them made the cookies bigger than ask for and got 18, melt in your mouth, wonders. Love the ground pecans and will make these again using hazelnuts. Used Splenda for the sugar without adding any extra or rolling in sugar after baking. I love them with the minor sweetness that really allows the pecan flavor to shine. As a side note these may be the fastest to make cookies I&#039;ve ever made! :D"
266635,499493,2018/1/2,5,"These cookies are so tasty and I especially love that they aren't overly sweet. I used all butter for these cookies and added a pinch of salt as did the other reviewer. Made these cookies for New Years day. Next year, they'll be on my holiday cookie tray for sure."
1581225,510907,2016/11/8,5,This turned out very tasty. A very healthy recipe too. Keeping this to make again.
368289,510907,2017/1/6,1,"Rather bland. Doctored it up by adding sweet potatoes, curry, paprika and pepper. Next time I will roast the vegetables and include sweet potatoes and maybe carrots and garlic while roasting."
2001523287,531307,2017/5/6,5,"First time ever cooking prime rib. Used this recipe last night and it was great!!!! Was really surprised that 15 minutes per pound on the high temperature, then let sit in the oven a couple hours would cook as desired. IT WAS GREAT!!!!!"
2001590451,531307,2017/6/18,1,If you use this recipe just throw the prime rib in the trash
2001504356,531307,2017/9/4,5,"The absolute BEST Prime Rib I've ever made!!! I'm an experienced cook, and have made Prime Rib multiple times ,but this by far is the best recipe I've ever used!! I've made this recipe with success multiple times!! Make sure you use a roasting rack. I find it browns better when I just wrap a cookie sheet with heavy foil, and put the roasting rack in top of it. Make sure to put beef broth on the bottom of the cookie sheet as well. It prevents the butter from getting burnt and no nasty burning smell or smoke. I set my oven on Convection Roast as well. Wrapping the pan in foil makes for easy clean up too! Bon Appetite!!"
2001769321,531307,2017/10/28,0,"I've made this twice now, EXACTLY as written, both times were PERFECT medium rare. Love this recipe!!!"

724631,498351,2014/2/1,5,"Awesome!  I could eat the cake without the frosting, it was that good!  This was the 2nd Italian Cream Cake that I have made, and this was a super star with the pecans and coconut in the cake batter.  If only I could convince DH to make it for me for my birthday!  Made for Photo Tag."
2002277403,524501,2018/9/17,5,This is Fabio Viviani's recipe from his weekly online show called Chow Ciao. He did three seasons of videos on Yahoo until the program ended. I highly recommend digging up those episodes for anyone interested in simple Italian cooking. He is super funny and his recipes are delicious!

The family loved it and we thought the recipe was spot on. Great job, Bizzy-bee! The instructions were perfect, right down to when to turn off the heat. This recipe is a new family favorite and we will make it again and again! We are very grateful for the recipe! Thanks, Kay~Cee"
306797,498331,2017/4/8,4,"We were at Giovanni's a few weeks ago, so made this recipe last night in a hope of revisiting that experience. The results were tasty, but I don't believe Giovanni's use flour in theirs, as our shrimp were coated but not as juicy as the real thing. Will definitely try again, but will omit the flour. Thanks for sharing."

We loved the oats in this nice thick pancake that gets all its sweetness from whatever you use for a topping or stir in from the offered variations. I made using the banana and coconut option, but we did fined the nutmeg way overpowering and will cut it way back (probably in half) next time I make these great country griddle cakes. Thanks for the post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Updating from four to five stars now the nutmeg has been cut back. Thanks Annacia for the great tasting pancakes.&quot;"
1419314,524982,2015/12/7,5,"This was creative all the way!  What a fun dinner I put together following this recipe.  Noodles into chips.  The best of the regular nachos with chips, except nothing is fried (except sausage).SO flavorful!  Noodles turn out a bit tough from the baking, so there&#039;s some serious chewing involved, but again, the fun and flavor factor win out over minor issues.  This should be a major contender for contest winner."
2000689016,524628,2015/12/3,5,Yum!!
2000041020,521242,2015/3/3,5,Great tea taste not too sweet with all the benefits of green &amp; black teas and naturally sweetened!  Love it!!
1802746590,513593,2014/5/17,0,This recipe is total BS. The KFC recipe has been in my family for over 40yrs. Sanders was best friends with my great uncle. The original recipe has been handed down each generation.
45106003,513593,2014/12/26,0,The &quot;real&quot; KFC chicken is made in a pressure cooker.
451301,493431,2013/4/12,5,"Very nice flavor, I mixed 1lb each for ground lamb and ground sirlion, Used Garlic instant potatoes, and left out the green peas because no one in the house likes the peas.  This recipe was dead on to what I remember Shepherds tasting like, thank you for posting such a yummy recipe"
2000495469,493431,2015/9/24,0,Tinned mushrooms?? Shepherds pie does not contain mushrooms. Especially not tinned! I&#039;m English and this isn&#039;t traditional at all
37449,511351,2014/2/10,5,"Oh my, these are so good! Almost like little cookies, nice and chewy and sweet. Thanks! I gave some of these to a friend for her birthday, some to a guy who cut some wood for me and kept the rest for me.  :) Made for PRMR game."
1620171,494524,2013/5/28,5,"Wow KUW, this is amazing! I let it marinate approx 24 hours (prepped night before) but forgot to put the lime in at that point, so added in right before cooking. The SMELL, it was driving me crazy I couldn&#039;t wait to eat it. Served per your suggestion on rice, put some saffron in it and used red kidney beans since I didn&#039;t have any black beans on hand. What a winner. Made for Photo tag Spring 2013."
2324285,494524,2013/8/19,5,"Very good and unique-tasting.  It&#039;s really loaded with lime flavor, which I loved.  I sauteed the chicken with some sliced bell peppers, and served everything on black bean &amp; coconut rice.  Tasted very tropical and delicious! [Made &amp; Reviewed for Rookie Recipes]"
1643801,495744,2013/4/26,5,This was so delicious. I prepared it just as written. My husband who is NOT  a poultry fan gobbled them up and even had them for leftovers the next day. Surprisingly tasted very much like poppers. A keeper for sure.
135470,504333,2013/8/24,4,"This tart is odd but tasty. I made it as mostly as directed, I used half honey and half agave and cut back just a smidge because I was concerned it would be too sweet, and it was just right. The texture is what is odd. The edge is kind of cakey but the center is much moister more like a damp frangipane. I used mostly fresh picked blackberries with some blueberries to added in - I did use more than a cup of berries to cover the whole thing. I baked it about 5 minutes longer than stated and still wasn&#039;t sure if the center was done but the edges and bottom were nice and brown. We really liked the combination of the almond and fruit, but decided we preferred it warm on the day it was baked better than room temp the next day. Made for ZWT 9 N Africa by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers."
2001034033,504333,2016/6/1,5,I first made this a year ago and it's a family favourite - even the girls at work love it... We use mixed berries and only honey and it's fabulous... Eat with whipped cream or ice cream (or both)..... DELISH!!!
2722807,496652,2013/3/5,5,these are AWESOME!
2722963,496652,2013/3/6,5,My wife made these for me and my friends for a party we had.  They were a complete hit!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Would highly recommend.
2726021,496652,2013/3/7,5,"We made these at work and they were great.  We froze the ones we didn't use and will eat them in a few months, can't wait!"
2726755,496652,2013/3/8,5,"Wow!! This appetizer is not only very easy to make, it is incredibly delicious! These bites practically melt in your mouth with  gooey, cheesy, pesto delight. This is a sure-fire crowd pleaser!! =)"
2731183,496652,2013/3/10,5,"These were so delicious that after tasting one I got so excited that I jumped up in the air. Unfortunately, I twisted my ankle when I landed and have been unable to work ever since. So worth it!"
169430,499585,2013/5/23,5,I really enjoyed this for this morning&#039;s breakfast. I took Cookgirl&#039;s lead and lowered the sweetening (I used Splenda) by about the same amount she did although I didn&#039;t measure. For the milk I used vanilla almond milk. It made a lovely and welcome change of pace that tasted very good indeed and is quick and east to make.
2597942,500412,2013/5/21,4,"These are extremely tasty little bites. I only gave it 4 stars (for now) because mine did not hold their shape and looked more like cookies with a baby bump, than like balls. This was most likely my fault, because I used a toaster oven rather than my gas oven (it wasn&#039;t working at the time).  I will deinately try these again (the taste is very good). I highly recommend using &quot;sharp&quot; cheddar. I will also put a pinch more of the seasonings in next time. I will post a revised review when I can make them correctly. Thank you for posting your olive puffs recipe. (Made for New Kids tag)"
125356,500412,2013/10/24,5,"Oh, so flavorful. I loved them. Thanks for such a great recipe. I put everything in the food processor, except for the olives. It took 2 minutes to make. I had some blue cheese stuffed olives, so  used those. Be careful if you eat them warm, because the olives inside they stay VERY hot."
695933,500412,2013/11/9,5,I used crescent rolls and cut the triangles into 3 separate pieces. I tried the phyllo dough but thought it was too difficult to use! I pressed shredded cheddar cheese into the dough. Sprinkled with garlic salt and/or paprika. I tried the pimento stuffed large green olives and I also tried almond stuffed and Jalape&ntilde;o stuffed olives too. Very easy and we really liked them. Grpa
2796729,499449,2013/4/26,5,I made these when I saw these on your web site. They are awesome! We ate them up in like 5 minutes.
2549237,513009,2014/4/25,5,"This broccoli was soooo good!  I loved the slight spice with the cheese.  It was so easy to throw in the oven for the last 20 minutes that my chicken was cooking so that they both came out of the oven at the same time.  I make oven roasted broccoli quite often, as it is my 9-year-old son&#039;s favorite vegetable.  I&#039;m sure this recipe will be put to good use in my home.  Thank you so much Baking Barb!  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
498271,499183,2014/4/23,5,Great tasty hummus!  I made half of the recipe and loved the smoky flavor from the ancho chili.  I did add just a little water so that it wouldn&#039;t be quite so thick and it came out smooth and creamy.  Served with warm pita bread and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2014
1888263,515019,2014/11/29,5,I love these with a warm winter soup or stew. I sift the dry ingredients before ading the wet.
226863,512486,2014/3/13,5,"My doctor just put me on a special diet, and I can&#039;t use milk products right now.  So I used Almond Milk.  The taste was great, but it wasn&#039;t as thick as a milkshake, more like a slushee.  Not sure if it was because I substituted with almond milk?  The dates gave it a bit of extra sweetness I think, and a little texture. Thanks for sharing!  Made for Rookie tag game."
2001393369,495547,2017/2/15,5,This recipe was exact and easy! Lobster tails came out amazing!
2001580523,495547,2017/6/12,4,"Turned out fantastic my wife loved it, first time making lobster."
1803506241,516517,2014/12/15,0,I tried this tonight. It was delicious!
2001420574,516517,2017/3/8,1,"when I roasted the garlic it turned brown then lighter then light orange and became very hot. I offered it water but it wanted my hardwood floor. it keeps on moving around the kitchen, slowly becoming bigger and i don't know what to do. pls respond"
199697,516517,2017/3/19,5,I've been cooking corned beef and cabbage for years and years. Hardly anyone eats the cabbage and it is more of a requirement than an enjoyable part of dinner. Then I found this recipe and everyone LOVED the cabbage. All but a tiny bit was eaten and everyone commented on how good it was. I chopped some garlic small and luckily had a HUGE bulb of elephant garlic that worked nicely to rub on the cabbage. The chopped garlic went into the EVOO and purposefully some was tucked into the nooks and crannies of the cabbage. Highly recommend this - will do this every year from now on!
2002013859,516517,2018/3/1,2,Will this work with red cabbage?
266635,511380,2014/1/10,5,"A nice version of butter chicken which we served over brown rice.  I actually watched Bal make this dish on Cooking Channel TV, so it was nice to try another of her recipes which emphasize healthier ingredients overall.  I liked the idea of using greek yogurt vs. cream.  The only change I made was to use less red pepper flakes as I was concerned that it would be too spicy.  Made for PRMR, January, 2014."
39835,511380,2014/4/24,5,Very good curry dish which we served over brown rice and with spinach. I did not know what butter chicken was but really enjoyed this dish - used olive oil instead of grapeseed oil and skipped the garam masala but otherwise made as directed. Thanks for sharing!
2001648874,511380,2017/7/30,4,"This recipe is awesome. For once I don't feel guilty eating Indian butter chicken! I have used Indian &quot;simmer sauces&quot; in the past and this is about 100x better. It tastes just like something you would get in an Indian restaurant. I made it exactly as the recipe is listed here. My only criticism is that the sauce is a little &quot;chunky&quot; because of the cumin seed, ginger, onion, etc. Next time, I think I will cut the cumin seed down to 1/2 T and add some ground cumin instead. I do like the cumin seed especially when it gets mixed into the rice, but 1T is a bit much. I will also probably do ground ginger instead of fresh. I might reduce the pepper flake too, if I'm not in the mood for something so spicy or if I'm cooking for others."
2001685235,511380,2017/8/24,5,I love this recipe and make it at least a couple times each month. It's quick and easy.
2001210026,526089,2016/11/1,4,I've made this a couple of times. After the first time we decided to go without the breadcrumbs. It did make a nice crunchy layer but felt it took away from the rest of the dish. The second time we added crumbled up bacon to the mixture. Both ways tasted good. It was just a matter of preference.
318262,492925,2013/6/17,4,"Yum! Great concept. I did end up using jarred tomato sauce and added a bit of cheese on top (love cheese). I found this well balanced, although I suggest making thin patties as they are a bit mushy when really thick."
2549237,492925,2013/7/8,3,"These were good.  They were slightly dry, next time I will use less bread crumbs and more carrots.  I made the tomato sauce that came with this recipe and that was delicious.  The only big change I made was to add a slice of mozzarella after flipping the burgers over during the last 4 minutes of cooking.  Thanks for posting this great healthy burger recipe Dr. Jenny.  Made for Photo Tag Spring 2013.  P.S. Sorry that the photo was bad, I couldn&#039;t get a good picture no matter what setting I had this on.  : ("
610488,505121,2013/8/20,4,"This unusual concoction could be considered a Tunisian hummus it was that good. Never expected to enjoy this mixture but made a very tasty side dish (I know this is a salad served at the beginning of the meal). Very thick and creamy and probably designed to help fill the belly when the meal is not very much, as it is in many parts of the world."
560491,503665,2014/5/16,5,"Made 1/2 the recipe for lunch with DH and we both really liked it.  Made with beef smoked sausage and diced tomatoes with onions but otherwise used the ingredients listed.  I liked the beans and rice together, wasn&#039;t sure DH would go for it, but he said her would eat it again!  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
804550,501197,2013/6/13,4,"This recipe pruduces a very sweet treat. I made three of them and opted not to add the green food cloring. I also omitted the powdered sugar only because I didn&#039;t have any. My guess is that the sugar would have made them less sticky, but for sweetness, they really don&#039;t need the extra sugar.

476809,501461,2013/6/15,0,This is my  go-to recipe for PB cheesecake! Glad I have it here so I can access it when I&#039;m cooking away from home. This is one of the few that has enough PB taste to suit me.
2002104299,535270,2018/4/9,5,It was everything!!!
169430,495366,2013/9/13,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed this hearty soup last evening. It really is pot pie filling without the crust. I used fresh chicken, carrots and peas and started by cooking the chicken and onions proceeding from there. It ended up thick and rich tasting even though I used less butter than ask. This is great comfort food and made for a very happy DH who kept on saying &quot;this is really good!&quot;. Thanks for sharing Jackie, we&#039;ll be seeing this again. :D"
2549237,501567,2013/6/23,4,These sandwiches were very easy and &quot;brewing&quot; the bratwurst added an extra little kick.  We used the Rye bread option.  This sandwich is very large and filling.  We liked the Sauerkraut with the mustard too.  I served this alongside steamed green beans for a fast and delicious dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe lazyme!  Made for Went To The Market tag game - Spring 2013.
655199,501567,2013/7/5,4,"This was VERY good!!! I&#039;ve made brats like this for years. I liked the &quot;sandwich&quot; idea over buns, so I used caraway rye bread. Also used Muenster cheese. I&#039;m not a big mustard fan, but my wife likes Gulden&#039;s, so that&#039;s what we used. THANKS for sharing!!!"
2000843807,522286,2018/3/27,5,Delicious! Had to use mirin instead of sherry and chinese vinegar but it still came out great! It will definetly go in my rotation! Thank you!
800543,497091,2013/5/17,5,"Restaurant quality right here!  This recipe is easy and delish.  I made 3 minor changes in the ingredients.  I used fresh orange juice simply because I have an orange tree in my yard.  I simmered the juice a few minutes to concentrate it before making the sauce.  I used fresh lemon juice because I have a lemon tree as well.  For the oil I used coconut oil.  It added even a little tropical flair to the dish.  The rest of the dish was prepared as written.  Outstanding blend of flavors!  Fruity, sweet, hot and tart.  It was perfect served over a nutty brown rice.  We loved this dish, it&#039;s a keeper!"
1803179828,531171,2018/10/8,4,"I really enjoyed added diced ham or cooked bacon. With all quiches you can add just about anything, try few spoonfuls of cottage cheese."
2549237,497470,2013/3/27,5,This was so simple and very flavorful.  I am lazy and hate cutting raw meat so I bought pre-sliced sirloin steak from the meat department and had my husband stand out in the snow and cook them on a charcoal grill.  These could easily become a frequent summertime meal for my family.  Thanks for another great recipe avalon!  Made for Spring 2013 PAC.

2002207660,501023,2018/7/4,5,"We are big fans of a tangy macaroni salad, and this one is off the chart good. Flavor amazing."
593927,500380,2013/5/16,5,"This was tasty for DD1 (5 years old), DD2 (18 months) and I. Mind you, it was kind of messy with the turmeric but made the organic unhomoginised yogurt I used pretty. I used only the slender end of a large organic butternut squash so that all the slices were uniform and I served it in the traditional Afghan manner by slathering yogurt on a plate and topping with the rest. Served with a thin version of socca bread to be gluten free. Made for My Food Odyssey - Afghanistan"
1449158,533190,2018/2/19,0,I make these almost every morning. Great sandwich. One word of caution. Use a covered dish when you microwave that egg!
2001047203,533190,2018/2/19,0,"Clearly these are not One-Minute breakfast sandwiches. It takes longer than that to gather the items, then toast the muffin and 1.5 minutes to cook the egg. That's not even counting cooking the bacon, if that is selected, though I guess one could buy the cooked bacon. Hopefully, it takes more than a minute to eats it, if that's the criterion for the title."
2001973294,533190,2018/2/20,0,You could cook the egg and bacon the night before and warm up in microwave and toast muffin.
2002001957,533190,2018/2/20,0,What's the low-carb alternative? (i.e. without the muffin)
1803704990,507975,2015/11/2,0,I used Truvia for this recipe instead of Splenda. It tasted great but has a real gummy texture. It baked beautifully and then collapsed to half of its size as it cooled. Will try again using Splenda.
2001212700,507975,2016/10/19,1,"Although it tasted great it did not raise at all. I tried making it twice, once mixing with stand mixer and once by hand, no difference."
227652,523532,2016/3/3,5,"An amazing recipe! My husband is on a very low carb diet &amp; just the other day he was missing mozzarella sticks. I found this recipe soon after. I followed the recipe pretty closely the first time--but I found I needed much more olive oil to cook the sticks--and I needed more batter to coat the sticks. I did roll them 3 times so that might have been why--but I was nervous about the cheese melting when they hit the hot oil. The 2nd time I tried them--I found that 2 rolls was good enough &amp; tasted better. I added Italian seasoning, oregano, parsley &amp; a little salt to the batter. U have to be careful to not crowd the sticks, and be careful when you take them out (breading can still be a little flimsy, so hold  onto the sticks). I did cut the string cheese in half, but the 2nd time I did not--and that was much easier to work with (perhaps my sticks were small). Husband really enjoyed them. Thank u very much for sharing!"

852554,502832,2013/7/22,5,"This is decadently delicious!  I will say though, I wasn&#039;t the best direction follower - I softened the cream cheese and mixed the green onion and dill (because I didn&#039;t see where to add it) then folded in the crabmeat into it and rolled it in the crescent rolls.  I also threw in some fresh parsley!  Thanks!  Made for ZWT 9"
169430,503385,2013/7/18,4,This bread is delicious and has a marvelous light interior texture and the crust is chewy. The only thing I would do differently would be to mix the oregano and feta into the dough instead of having it all on top. The cheese became too hard to eat around the edges and the rest fell off in cutting and eating. I used fresh oregano and that too would have been better spread through the bread. It&#039;s quite easy to make and I&#039;ll make it again with putting the goodies into the dough.
2001951941,511223,2018/1/24,0,Eww Not sour cream
280271,493462,2014/4/26,5,Now this is an excellent dish...the onions really didn&#039;t caramelize but they did get golden brown and very tasty...I cut the recipe in half and used an 8X8 pan...I topped the chicken with fried onions from a can of French&#039;s Fried Onions...for some reason cheese didn&#039;t seem like it would work with soy sauce...that&#039;s just me...DH loved this and he&#039;s a chicken hater...thanks for posting the recipe...Made for Spring 2014 PAC...=)

I was a little afraid because it featured some ingredients I&#039;d never heard of, but I am so glad I overcame my fear and just took the plunge.  Don&#039;t be afraid of the fish sauce, it is NOT that strong with all of the other ingredients.  This is a perfect medley of mingling flavors.  I cannot say enough about this spicy, rich recipe.  I served it over rice to sop up all of the wonderful juice.  Thank you so much for sharing!"

169430,501215,2013/6/14,5,I made this lovely rice to go with a creamy chicken dish yesterday evening and it was pure pleasure with each bite. The seasoning is spot on for my taste and I will surely be making this again. :D
37449,501215,2013/6/14,5,"I used brown basmati rice, so cooked it about 40 minutes. Loved the nice spices in this. Made for Vegetarian swap-June 2013."
163112,501215,2013/6/21,5,Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  There wasn&#039;t as much caramelization as I was expecting when I added the sugar.  I served this with Annacia&#039;s recipe#500358.  Can this be a NA/ME Tag the next time you&#039;re IT?  ;)
242766,500227,2013/10/3,5,"Outstanding scones!!  We loved these quick and easy, not overly sweet scones.  My husband doesn&#039;t like scones that are sickening sweet, so these got two-thumbs up from him as soon as he took his first bite.  I didn&#039;t have any buttermilk, so I used the common buttermilk substitution of 1 TBSP lemon juice in 1 cup milk and let it stand for 15 minutes.  It worked perfectly in this recipe.  Cinnamon baking chips are hard to find in my area, so when I find them I stock up and keep them in the freezer.  I am always looking for recipes using these chips so I was thrilled to find this one.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper!!  **Made for My 3 Chefs - October 2013**"
169430,500227,2014/5/1,5,"Two things at the top of my favorite list are cinnamon and scones so how could this recipe miss! The scones came out beautifully well risen and with a perfect texture and sweet level. Add to that the little cinnamon morsels in the scones and a mug of cinnamon coffee and we have one very happy breakfast. Used Splenda to sweeten and made just 4 scones. Two disappeared with the coffee and the other two will vanish in the not too far off future. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
176615,500227,2014/7/2,5,"Really good! Tender with a crisp top. I didn&#039;t bother brushing with butter, just sprinkled with cinnamon sugar from my pantry which I&#039;d made from vanilla sugar. Also, cut each circle into 8 wedges for 16 total smaller sized scones. Will make these again!"
367392,527731,2016/8/1,5,"This is absolutely delicious! I made for a neighborhood potluck, I couldn't wait to take the leftovers home and have some.... Well, guess what? I had NO leftovers! Making it again today for hubby and me. It is very refreshing using tomatoes out of the garden! Thanks for sharing!"
539686,493441,2013/3/5,5,"This makes a beautiful salad. I made it as directed, with the exception of toasting the pita for topping. We are watching our calories. The second night I served it topping a larger green salad with an additional drizzle of olive oil and squeeze of lemon...it was even tastier this way. Thanks for posting."
2707517,494461,2013/2/23,5,love the sofrito! really gives it spicy flavor.
135470,513705,2014/8/28,5,"Easy and delicious, I love the combination of the Kahlua, coffee and ice cream. For the cake I used a brown sugar genoise that complimented the coffee flavors. Made for  the 2014 Culinary Quest."

2201427,518022,2014/8/20,5,What an awesome recipe!!!!  This just might be one of my &quot;go-to&quot; favorites!
2352596,518022,2014/8/24,0,Anyone else think a cup of sugar for four chicken thighs sounds excesive? Over 1200 calories per serving. Wont be trying this one.
2211242,518022,2014/9/11,5,well balanced sweet and sour flavor and a creative use of orzo instead of the typical rice
1179225,495525,2015/1/24,5,Loved it...just what I was looking for to frost a chocolate cake. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
128473,497824,2016/10/16,4,"We really enjoyed these quick and easy to make meatballs. They were excellent, tender, moist, juicy and flavorful. The stuffing was a nice addition. The sauce was delicious, who knew it would taste so good. Thank you for sharing. Made for First Time Tag"
599450,502004,2014/1/15,5,"These were so easy to make and very tasty! Thanks, Crafty Lady! Made for Aussie Kiwi Recipe Swap #80."
2703085,495224,2013/2/20,5,This was a hit with my whole family!  And that's not an easy task with six people's different tastes at the table...
2712138,495224,2013/2/26,5,This Harvest salad was one of the best I've ever had.  The warm maple ranch dressing is too amazing for words! I highly suggest you try this salad at home.
685883,506705,2014/9/17,5,"This is a great ice cream base recipe. I had American pawpaws, not papayas. I didn&#039;t realize until after it was done that the recipe was for a papaya"
480195,502893,2013/7/24,5,Very good recipe. I served this over zucchini pancakes (recipe 503941). Absolutely delicious.
284897,502893,2013/8/28,5,"I cut this recipe down to serve 4 people.&lt;br/&gt;Served with lamb kebabs this sauce was a wonderful accompaniment to the lamb&lt;br/&gt;Will be making this again with lamb, as this family loved it."
37449,515586,2014/5/1,5,This was so easy! I put in blender with almond milk and a little cinnamon and enjoyed as  a midday snack. Thanks! Made for Pick a Chef(PAC) spring 2014.
1800335603,493084,2013/11/26,4,I enjoyed this meal.
292090,520657,2015/4/28,5,"Hubby and I both loved this - great rib-stickin&#039; comfort food and easy enough for work days.   Since my kitchen is gluten-free, I used my favorite Barilla gluten free pasta instead of the tortellini - worked great"
690623,510926,2017/11/9,0,I made half the recipe because the juice came in 750ml bottles. I made as directed and wish I had made the full recipe. Living in a rural area items such as these are often impossible to find. I'm delighted to have found this gem and already have about 6 uses for it. It made a wonderful glaze for Pork Tenderloin. Made in memory of a lovely lady. Sharon you are missed.
131126,494125,2013/3/29,5,"Loved these! I wish I had more stars to pass out! Very different &amp; a recipe I&#039;ll keep to use again. Although the recipe only made 9 standard size muffins instead of the mentioned 12 I was happy.  The muffins are sweet, savory, and each bite is accompanied with a sigh of pleasure.  I made these to serve with soup, but we found ourselves eating them spread with honey butter for breakfast and snacks.   They would be a perfect fit for a &quot;ladies luncheon&quot; paired with a fancier chicken salad or even baked as mini muffins for a upscale brunch.   I would add &#039;fold blueberries into mixture gently&#039; to the directions and change the servings to 9, but otherwise not change a thing.  Thank you for sharing the recipe! Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef."
266635,494125,2014/5/29,5,"These corn muffins are delicious!  I love the savory taste of the corn muffin with the burst of blueberry and the crunch of the pecans.  I especially love the fact that they are not sweet -- just a wonderful surprise and delicious improvement to the average corn muffin.  They can be served as a breakfast/brunch item or with dinner.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag, May, 2014."
463435,505288,2013/11/27,5,"Elmotoo, I&#039;m excited to be the first to review this recipe! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs for the chicken. At first I was concerned that it would be lacking in flavor...but I couldn&#039;t have been more wrong. The chicken was so moist, and flavorful...just plain delicious! Best of all it was simple and quick to make. My ginger grater is still packed, so I used a potato peeler to peel thin strips of ginger which I then minced. I was a smidgen over on the ginger, but not by enough to alter the recipe. The only drawback I found, was there were no leftovers. I will definitely be making this dish again in the future. Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe. Made and reviewed for the 82nd AUS/NZ Recipe Swap. (Note should there be no stars in this review it was rated ***** I would have given more if I could.)"
66448,512009,2014/6/2,5,"Made as written, done perfectly!"
2002286380,512009,2018/9/28,5,Happened to have some epicure lemon dilly spice so used that instead but omg this really IS a foolproof way to make salmon. I have made this dish 4 times now - perfect every time.
2001015435,512030,2016/7/13,5,That is the best chicken gravy recipe it was quick simple and very tasty thank you for sharing
2001424202,512030,2017/3/8,0,Made this today but use rice flour instead took a little longer to cook but my goodness so good
2001464528,512030,2017/3/30,5,"I increased the butter to a half cup and used two boillion cubes to two cups of water instead of stock, but this is an excellent recipe"
2001737315,512030,2017/10/2,0,How do you make the chicken broth. ?
2001747016,512030,2017/10/10,5,"Yum. Increased butter ( used unsalted real butter) a bit, used canned chicken broth, plus half packet of oxo bouillon used low salt varieties of broth and oxo"
2001779285,512030,2017/11/5,0,To make chicken broth get 2 dry chicken broth packets and mix in 2 cups of water on warm heat and mix until the dry broth becomes liquid
1060667,512030,2017/12/2,5,"Loved, loved, loved!"
1802739971,512030,2017/12/5,5,I added a little chicken boullion and Mrs Dash Garlic &amp; Herb and the gravy was AWESOME.
2000851412,512030,2017/12/26,0,"My gravy came out just wonderful, my husband and I loved it . I just want to say Thank You and Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year's"
2000107081,512030,2018/1/16,0,"My gravy came out really good,was short on broth so added a little milk and a tablespoon of chicken boullion. Really good and easy"
2001960418,512030,2018/1/29,0,is there any thing else rather than oxo hate the smell turns my tummy sick to make this flave way to stong
2001985965,512030,2018/2/11,5,"This is a great, easy way to make gravy when you don't have drippings as I didn't have any to add to my roasted turkey I had frozen/reheated-very tasty and my family raved. Can add a little cream to make it more milk based. It has become a staple recipe."
2002295081,512030,2018/10/8,0,"I used an extra teaspoon of butter. I was making a ham based gravy so I used &quot;Better Than Bouillon&quot; ham. I mixed the stock per directions on the jar of bouillon. I used a little less flower because I've used this recipe before to make chicken gravy and it was too thick for my liking. Onice I combined the flower and butter I added an ADDITIONAL TABLESPOON (roughly, maybe a little more )of the bouillon. I poured in 2 cups of the broth I made and it is DELICIOUS!"
2002332734,512030,2018/11/15,5,"This gravy is fab. I used home-made stock and seasoned it with about 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. It would be a fab quick-cook gravy for Thanksgiving. For tonight, after I saw how good it was, I cut/ground up a hot and a sweet cased sausage, and added it after the gravy was made. It is obscene. Spoon/bowl obscene."
2002212158,512030,2018/12/6,5,Love this gravy. I always add a little garlic powder at the end.
724631,513202,2014/3/15,5,"My step-daughter and her husband declared this to be the best cheesecake they had ever tasted.  We decided this was a NY-style cheesecake.  It seems that no matter how good a springform pan claims to be, leakage occurs; I used redundant safeguards: 1) I lined the inside of the pan with aluminum foil to prevent the batter from leaking; 2) I then placed a parchment paper circle on the inside bottom, and lined the interior sides with parchment paper to make it easy to unveil the cheesecake; and 3) I laid another large piece of aluminum foil under the pan and pressed it up the sides to prevent the water bath from seeping into the pan.  To make it easier to remove the cheesecake pan from the pressure cooker after cooking, I made 2 long 4-ply aluminum straps and crossed them at a 90&deg; angle on top of the trivet, then placed the filled pan on top and fastened the ends of the straps above the pan.  I had a good laugh at myself, but I experienced no leaks, so it was worth it!  I&#039;m not sure about chocolate wafers with a lemon cheesecake, so I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs. By the way, I used a 7&quot;-diamerter, 3&quot; tall Kaiser Noblesse springform pan, which fit easily into my oval 6-quart electric pressure cooker. My cheesecake cooked up perfectly, with no pool of water in the middle.  I made this after dinner so it could chill overnight for the next day&#039;s dinner. This recipe produces a fine-tasting cheesecake without a lot of effort, and the smaller size is perfect for small households.  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag."
1250824,513202,2016/2/13,5,"Excellent and easy cheesecake! Genuine creamy, NY style cheesecake and so easy and quick to make. I mixed this according to the recipe and then baked in a buttered and parchment lined spring form pan (omitted the crumb crust).  I placed the spring form in an Instant Pot (electric pressure cooker) on top of the trivet with 1 cup water in the bottom.  When baked the time listed in the recipe, it wasn&#039;t quite done.  I found 24 minutes to be perfect time for the Instant Pot. After blotting the condensation off the cooked cake, I added a sour cream topping.  I whisked together 1 cup sour cream, 3 TB sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla.  Poured on top of the cake and then put in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 10 mins to set the topping.  I then cooled and refrigerated before removing from the spring-form pan. Everyone raves about this cheesecake."
2000927680,508854,2016/3/19,2,The award was likely sponsored by the dairy farmers of America.  Way too much dairy fluid and perhaps a mistake was made in the amounts since the 1/2 and 1/2 was a quart and the heavy cream was 2 pints which are the same amount.  Recommend starting with butter and sauteed minced onion.  Eliminate the whole milk and half of the cream.  Eliminate salt and pepper and add another teaspoon of Old Bay.  Some chicken or vegetable broth is also warranted - a cup or cup and 1/2.  Add a bay leaf and some mace and you have a new recipe all-together.  Wondra is a fine thickener without having to mix the cornstarch.
2001021754,508854,2016/5/22,5,"Excellent recipe. Absolutely perfect every time. I made one small adjustment, add white shoepeg corn."
2001162893,508854,2016/9/10,5,"It always annoys me when someone gives such a low rating and than continues to give the 54 ways they would change the recipe! Submit your own recipe if it's so much better. This recipe is authentic and true to it's area. If you don't like it, don't make it. Everyone has different tastes and little things they do to make it suit them. I don't see the point in leaving bad reviews and knocking down someone else's recipe. If you note in the title it stated &quot;rich&quot; and not a diet soup. My entire family which has grown to about 38 people absolutely love this recipe. We like our &quot;cream of&quot; soups thick not watery."
2001520206,508854,2017/5/3,5,This recipe is so simple and wonderful! My family loved it. We are crab snobs from Maryland as well. I wouldn't change a thing.
2001902842,508854,2017/12/31,0,Way too much liquid in relationship to the crabmeat.Nice taste but next time will halve the liquids.
2001004864,527541,2017/3/2,3,"First off, 2 lbs of jalapenos for one sammie? Um, no. Im sure they are really yum, but for my money, jarred will work just fine. And guava jam? Not at Safeway. Substituted apricot and its good. The black beans are tasty though."
2001122411,527541,2017/3/3,5,This was delicious even so I used a jar of pickled jalapenos since I can't buy fresh where I live in Spain-I also could not get any guava jam (which is unusual) so I used Mermelada de Vino Tinto de Ronda.
226867,533120,2017/8/21,4,"This made a tasty meal with the rice. I think the added garnishes were helpful to give it a little more texture. I did not think this was meant to be lentil soup, so did not add extra water as the list of ingredients mentioned at the end. It was only a little more liquid than the rice. I think chutney would have been a good accompaniment if I had some available!"
383346,494622,2013/6/27,5,"I didn&#039;t know this recipe would turn out so good.  Because the only wet thing in it is the oil.  But with the garlic, roasted peppers, spinach and feta, it&#039;s so yummy.  Thanks Elizabeth :)  Made for PRMR tag game"
67728,493636,2013/4/13,5,"I love, love, love agua de jamaica, so I knew this would be a winner with me. I wasn&#039;t sure how the spices were going to be in this, but they were perfect (not too strong, just a hint of them in the finished drink). Since I knew this would disappear quickly between DH and I, I made a double batch (with the single-recipe amounts of spices and 2 cups of sugar). This was the perfect strength where it wouldn&#039;t get too watered down, even with a full glass of ice. I&#039;ll be using this again in the summer, for sure! Thanks for posting!

39835,504428,2013/8/25,4,"Very good salad - we had it as a main dish, added some tofu. I also used a green bell pepper instead of a red one, but otherwise made as directed. Having the rest for lunch during the week, maybe adding some tuna to it. Thanks for sharing! Made for ZWT9"
92006,504428,2016/8/9,5,"This salad has great flavors, and it gets better after standing. I only added a pinch of salt and a dash of hot sauce, otherwise made as directed for CQ '16. Thanks for sharing!"

DS, and I had a slice for lunch, and we, (kids too), had a ready dinner.  2 slices each filled us up, The prep time took a bit longer, but it was me.

165308,496614,2013/6/3,5,"perfection in the world of the biscuit. next time I&#039;m going to cut the dough into only eight biscuits, to avoid the arguing over the last one!! Thank you for the recipe Hen Basket."
2905618,496614,2013/7/17,5,"You can not go wrong with this recipe, so easy and they just melt in your mouth, Good-bye to my old recipe..love,love these biscuits!"
135887,496614,2013/10/6,3,Tasted great but what a wet sloppy mess to make.  I am thinking of adding an additional 1/2 cup of bisquick mix to the dough in addition to the half cup used to roll out
269883,496614,2013/10/30,3,"Yes, these are easy and yes, you get a nice light roll. However, they are pretty tasteless. I didn&#039;t use all the butter so perhaps that would make them a bit more tasty. I also substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream to bring down the fat content, too. Perhaps the sour cream makes them taste better. So, if you are thinking of substituting, think again. I may try them again with full fat butter and sour cream."
2264777,496614,2014/2/6,5,"This is not so much a review of the recipe, but a review of the reviewers.  Don&#039;t give a recipe a 3 star rating when you didn&#039;t even try it as is.  Here is a paraphrase &quot;I made all these changes and they were not good.  Here is a 3 star rating.&quot;  How dumb is that?  You didn&#039;t even review this recipe.  You reviewed a completely different recipe that you created on your own.  Make the recipe as it is written and review it as written, or don&#039;t review it at all.  I see this all the time on this site."
1802375343,496614,2014/2/9,0,I tried mixing this twice and got a gooey mess both times.  I do not know what I did wrong and I followed directions but still got a gooey mess for dough.
165755,496614,2014/2/15,5,"These were amaaaaazing!  I made a boo-boo and added the 1/4 c. melted butter to the mixture and they still came out amazing.  I will be making these again in the near future.  For the person who found them to be too wet, they are indeed wettish until you add baking mix to the bottom and top during the last step.  Don&#039;t overdo this just enough to be able to shape, transfer them.  They were awesome even with my little boo-boo.  Thank you for a great and extremely simple recipe!"
891756,496614,2014/2/16,5,I made these tonight.  They are great.  Thanks for the recipe.
160638,496614,2014/8/19,0,Bisquick contains no yeast so there is no need to knead it.  In fact it&#039;s defeating the purpose.  That&#039;s why people are getting flat biscuits.  Just mix it until just blended then either spoon it out into the pan or double the recipe and spread it into a 9x13&quot; pan and cut them after they are baked.  But you will need to bake them at 425 and for a longer time.
9953205,496614,2014/8/24,5,"These were very easy and delicious. As a southerner who has made biscuits for 50 years, the dough was just as sticky as biscuit dough made with shortening and flour.  I don&#039;t know why the others had problems but I will definitely make these again."
2001803096,496614,2017/11/18,5,Made these one saturday for breakfast and the family ate them up. My grandbabies already requested some more.
2001808442,496614,2017/11/20,5,it turned out so good I was so excited when it came out very good
403729,496614,2014/9/16,4,"Pretty tasty.  Used light sour cream as that is what I typically have on hand, followed the recipe exactly using #35950 as the biscuit mix.  Pretty close to a homemade buttermilk biscuit, and a bit quicker to make.  Served with chicken and sausage gumbo, made for a great meal.  Thanks for posting."
1913729,496614,2014/9/16,5,"Guys, this is a wet dough and I agree with posters who discourage folk who not only do not try the recipe as stated but then give it less than 5 stars.  It&#039;s as though you are downgrading your own recipe at that point. A couple hints: do not knead; mix only until ingredients come together; turn out onto floured surface; fold &amp; shape; cut; bake.  My 7-up were room temp and my sour cream sat out about 30-40 minutes.  Delicious."
280271,496614,2014/10/29,5,Delicious and so easy...we loved them...yes the dough is sticky but you just have to work with it...I got 10 biscuits out of mine...although next time I think I will not pat the dough so thin and get the 9 bigger biscuits...made for...&quot;What&#039;s on the Menu&quot; tag game...
1803290176,496614,2014/11/2,5,I have never been able to make good biscuits with this recipe I made GREAT biscuits!
1910869,496614,2014/11/24,0,Great Recipe!!  Very quick and no need to alter anything.  My family loves them!
1803407887,496614,2014/11/25,5,I have never made biscuits before but this recipe looked easy so I tried it tonight.  Easy and awesome taste.  Will definitely make these again.
1803435945,496614,2014/11/29,0,My son and husband just about swallowed their tongues on these biscuits.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
45420974,496614,2014/11/30,5,"Very easy, might I say foolproof? Perfect the first time. (and in a problematic propane oven that never bakes well) Light, flaky, not too sweet. The only problem is that they were gone in a flash-my family loved them. From now on, I&#039;ll always make a double batch."
1493816,496614,2014/12/1,5,"So good! Mine were much flatter, in large part because I made this with gluten free flour. But it was delicious -- buttery, biscuit-y, and wonderful. Highly recommend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substitutions made: Seltzer for 7-up, gluten free flour for regular flour -- baked for about 17 minutes."
2913442,496614,2014/12/7,5,"I just made these, exactly as the recipe says, and they were delicious, buttery and crisp on the outside, flaky and soft inside!  I ate four all by myself for breakfast with homemade peach jam.  Yum!  I&#039;d have liked them to be a little thicker--the recipe doesn&#039;t say what thickness they should be when you pat out the dough--so I&#039;ll pat them out thicker next time.  I&#039;m going to make these for Christmas, they&#039;ll be delicious with ham.  By the way, I agree with the reviewer who said that the exact recipe should be reviewed.  If you make these with Greek yogurt, omit the butter, whatever, and they don&#039;t turn out, don&#039;t blame the recipe!  If you&#039;re going to post a review, it should be a review of the recipe, not one that&#039;s tweaked with multiple changes and substitutions!"
1803489523,496614,2014/12/11,0,"This is a question, not a review, I&#039;ll do that after I make these... My question is does the flavor of the 7-up consist after cooking? Has anyone tried just carbonated water instead and if so does it change the taste? I&#039;m just a little skeptical about the 7-up the flavor doesn&#039;t sound very appetizing."
110654,496614,2014/12/14,5,These were great and soooo easy! Followed directions using a home made bisquick mix. Good flavor and light and fluffy. Will definitely make these again!
11905954,496614,2014/12/15,5,"Excellent, I made 2 dozen and they were great. The ones we had left over were scarfed up and took home by guests."
1803567803,496614,2014/12/27,5,I have tried many biscuit recipes over the years and I&#039;ve never been very pleased with any of them. My husband has been asking me to be sure to learn how to make biscuits with his mom before she passes away! I tried this recipe Christmas Day really hoping they would turn out and I could impress everyone. These were super easy to make and very good! The dough is very sticky but you just have to flour your surface and the top of the dough whend you put it on the wax paper. I will definitely make them thicker next time and maybe add a dab of salt for a little more taste but my family was impressed and I plan on using this this recipe every time! My husband said he wants me to make them weekly! Thanks so much for this recipe!!!
2726849,496614,2015/1/4,0,Excellent and extremely easy!  The first time I made a batch I did not have sour cream.  I added plain yogurt and baking soda.  Turned out great!
227978,496614,2015/1/19,5,"These are the softest, fluffiest biscuits I&#039;ve ever made.  They&#039;re quite easy to make, too.  I&#039;m so glad I came across this recipe.  I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll make them often.  Tonight, I served them with chicken and steamed carrots.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, The Hen Basket.  I made them for the Best of 2014 cooking tag game."
461834,496614,2015/1/20,5,"Very good biscuits.  I made this exactly as written, except for adding some chives and I cooked them in a pre-heated cast iron biscuit pan, so I made them as drop biscuits.  Five stars for be so quick and easy to make!!  They are a little sweet for me, I am a totally savory type of biscuit eater unless using for shortcake desserts, so will definitely make these again and maybe add some mini chocolate chips for strawberry shortcakes, yummy!!  Thanks for sharing a fun and easy recipe!!"
266635,496614,2015/1/27,5,"Delicious biscuits and easy to make even for a person who doesn&#039;t bake that often, like myself.  They came out nice and soft -- a great recipe for any meal.  Made for the Best of 2014 tag game."
128473,496614,2015/1/30,5,"I loved this recipe.  The biscuits were wonderful, big, light tender and flaky.  I didn&#039;t have any bisquick mix so I made up a batch, it worked really well with these tasty biscuits. I used club soda as my clear pop.  I got 6 beautiful big biscuits.  They were the perfect accompaniment for tonight&#039;s sticky chicken, glazed carrots and rice.  Thanks so much for sharing a recipe that I will make again.  Made for Best of 2014 Tag Game."
296809,496614,2015/2/8,5,"Made for the FF&amp;F Best of 2014 event &amp; applauded by TeresaS. I used Bisquick &amp; Sprite Zero to make these tasty biscuits. Yeah, the dough is wet &amp; sticky .. So like TeresaS, you work w/it. Flour your counter, flour your hands &amp; make it happen. I used them to make biscuits &amp; sausage gravy. My DH &amp; his brother attacked the combo before I could snap a pic &amp; didn&#039;t stop the attack until there was nothing left. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
74904,496614,2015/2/18,5,So much better than bisquit biskets!
2000060594,496614,2015/3/14,4,"Great biscuits, and I&#039;m a Southerner. These come out like Hardees&#039; biscuits!

Minus one star for lack of yield, and calling for a 9&quot; square pan while showing a 9&quot; round pan in the picture."
2000095923,496614,2015/3/28,5,"These biscuits were super simple to make, required very few ingredients and were absolutely delicious! They were gone in a matter of minutes and left people wanting more! Lastly, I never post food pics. on Facebook but it was an absolute must for me to do so! People asked about them and I directed them to this site!"
2000114441,496614,2015/4/4,0,"I always double the recipe, because my family absolutely loves these.  These get rave reviews from all who get them.   Great for weekends with eggs or equally good for Sunday family dinners.  Make extra and heat them up for late night snacks with honey!"
2000124959,496614,2015/4/7,5,Best biscuits ever!!
2000165635,496614,2015/4/25,5,"I have never been able to make good biscuits!  My son Loves these! I followed the recipe and they turned out perfect! Thanks,"
2000174622,496614,2015/4/29,5,I make these biscuits a lot and my family finishes them off in one sitting. I have to triple recipe as I have very large family. I have also laid them flat and froze then places in zip lock bag for a quick breakfast biscuit. Buttered and warm...my oh my are these delicious!
2340615,496614,2015/5/9,5,"I am 58 years old and enjoy cooking. This is the first biscuit recipe that actually turned out a soft , tasty biscuit. I went by the directions exactly. I can hardly believe they were made by my own hand and came out of my oven! Thanks!  This recipe is definitely a keeper."
2000209619,496614,2015/5/17,4,"i tried the recipe as given and it was too runny. i added about 3/4 cup more flour and it came out very good. i was able to get 10 biscuits, and i brushed them with butter after they came out of the oven. they were moist and soft. very good. thanks."
2000091009,496614,2015/5/21,0,We enjoyed this recipe very much and will be using it often.  Very tasty and love the bottom crunch.
2000254242,496614,2015/6/7,5,Excellent recipe. I have made plain and with cheese and garlic. Everyone raves for these.
2000261841,496614,2015/6/10,3,"These were okay, but they were to sticky to pat out.  I used a lot of extra mix to get them pliable.  This made them come out tasting floury."
2000332127,496614,2015/7/11,5,Melt in your mouth pure goodness.
1957498,496614,2015/8/30,5,"Followed directions as written.  They were amazing, this will be my go to recipe!!"
2000514028,496614,2015/10/2,5,These are my favorite! I just tend to make them as drop biscuits. I also use Sierra Mist and a touch of organic garlic powder. These things are heaven! Also you can mix in some cheese of your choice to add a new texture.
1199752,496614,2016/5/22,5,"I make these all the time. They are very forgiving. I add 1/2 c bacon and 1 cup cheese, 1 teaspoon onion powder and proceed as normal. Makes a great breakfast biscuit on the go."
2001821976,496614,2017/11/23,5,"I have been making these biscuits from this exact recipe for a couple of years. So easy, and a hit everywhere I take them. Needs no tweaking. It's a perfect easy recipe! I just double up for more."
1421135,496614,2016/9/9,5,"I was bound and determined to perfect this almost already-perfect 7-Up Biscuit recipe! There are many versions and variations to this particular recipe, but this recipe is the simplest and best recipe of them all. I've made the biscuits a dozen times or so with consistent results each time. The texture of the biscuits speaks for itself; however I was wanting a more fluffy, lighter biscuit so I added 1/2 tsp baking powder to the biscuit mix before cutting in the sour cream. I let them sit for about 15-20 mins and they DID rise approximately 1/4 to 1/3 more than the recipe without baking powder. But the real surprise came after the biscuits came out of the oven -- I had my LIGHT and FLUFFY biscuits! They were absolutely awesome with honey and butter spread on them. Needless to say, my family loved them too, as there were NO leftovers!"
2001174003,496614,2016/9/18,5,easy peasy!! and delicious... love this 4 ingredient recipe- It's my first time making them but far from my last!!! Thanks 4 sharing
2001243899,496614,2016/11/13,5,"I just made this first time and what a huge hit!! Delish!! Easy to make,, easy ingredients!! Everyone ( including my finicky step son) lovedd it!! I had to take a pic before they all dissapeared lol! I also make garlic butter along side of the gravy,, goes well with both! will definantly be making these again! Great recipe:)"
2783733,496614,2016/11/22,5,Outstanding! Super easy &amp; so good. They taste like KFC biscuits only better! I will have to start doubling the batch because my family of 4 wiped them out and none were left after dinner.
2001323210,496614,2016/12/26,5,These are awesome. I made a batch for home and work and at both places loved them. About the only complaint I have is that now these are the only biscuits my family wants so..... Other than that the are Great!
2001394278,496614,2017/2/16,5,So these turned out PERFECT. All I did different was used Fresca cause I had no 7up. Sooooooo yummy!!! And it ended up making like 12 biscuits. Maybe mine were smaller? Either way!! Yum yum yum!!
2001414694,496614,2017/3/3,5,I make sourdough normally. Then decided to try these on a whim for something new. The Husband loved them. Not to mention these are now the only biscuits allowed in the house. They are amazing. If making for dinner instead of breakfast. I have added garlic and Italian seasoning for a change. Add both to the dough and to the butter. I also add more butter. =-)
2000248025,496614,2017/4/4,5,"So good! I've tried several biscuit recipes in the past with this one being my favorite. These are soft, buttery, and tender. I used Pioneer biscuit mix, Sprite, and I just cut the biscuits into squares. I also turned the biscuit in the melted butter so that both sides were coated in butter. I will definitely be cooking these from now on."
2000965211,496614,2017/4/5,5,"Just made these biscuits. I am 73 yrs. old and my biscuits have always been like hockey pucks. My MIL made homemade bread, pies, cakes, etc. My husband just said best biscuits he’s ever eaten. And they were. What I did wrong....I burnt my butter and had to start over. I didn’t put bisquick on my hands and they were a sticky mess. I read where someone added 1/2 tsp. of baking soda. That is the only change I made. I’m doing cartwheels......and that’s not easy at my age. LOL. One question....is it better to flash freeze before or after baking. We like to travel in our RV and I need these in my freezer."
1802833488,496614,2017/4/10,5,Excellent biscuits. I've been looking and trying biscuit recipes to make for my husband and they never turn out right. This is THE recipe for biscuits! Thank you. 5 + stars for sure!
2001505251,496614,2017/4/24,5,We both LOVE these biscuits! They're super easy to make and turn out perfect each time. :)
2001420891,496614,2017/4/27,5,This is the best/easiest recipe for biscuits I have ever used! I have never been able to make a biscuit that weren't hard as a rock until now. Everyone loves my biscuits.
2001663834,496614,2017/8/9,5,I love this recipe..these biscuits are perfect.. I will add alittle sugar next time.
2001674900,496614,2017/8/16,5,"I have been making scratch biscuits for years and this recipe is probably one of the best recipes I've ever used that starts out with a store-bought baking mix (prefer Bisquick or Pioneer). I tried this recipe a couple years ago and it was OK but the dough was so wet that the biscuits really didn't look as pretty. So I decided to try one more time and found this recipe which recommends adding a half a cup of your baking mix to the board or mat you dump the dough out on. Then I rolled around the dough in the baking mix and worked it a minute or two, just until it came together. The dough is still a wet dough, but by using that extra half a cup of baking mix it makes it the perfect consistency. I made the recipe pretty much exactly as it is written. The only thing I did different was really more to do with a preference instead of any kind of change to the recipe. I cut the sour cream in with a couple of table knives and used a fork to mix the 7-Up into that mixture. I did use a 9 inch round cake pan. But when I finished working the dough, I patted it out then divided it into 10 equal pieces of dough by hand, no cutter. This is something I've always done when I made my scratch biscuits. Then I rolled each piece of dough in my hand for a couple of seconds till they were smooth and rounded out a bit, then place them in the pan with the melted butter evenly spaced out. Once they were all in the pan I took my hand and pressed the balls of dough down a bit until each biscuit was touching each other on the sides. The biscuits will not come out perfectly round, but to me that's what makes the biscuit homemade, that they are not all exactly perfectly round biscuits. This is the way my grandmother did it as well. She very rarely ever rolled out biscuit dough. The taste and texture of these biscuits will remind you of a fluffy buttermilk biscuit. One last thing, maybe just my oven, but I found 425&deg; at about 13 to 14 minutes was perfect. Will be using this recipe over and over."
2001973616,496614,2018/2/4,5,"These biscuits are quick, buttery and fluffy! You can save calories, carbs and sugar by substituting diet lemon-lime soda. Try to find one sweetened with splenda for baking without the bitterness of other sweeteners."
2001633793,496614,2018/3/22,0,"Going to give these a whirl tonite with baked chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and broccoli and cheese."
2001801643,496614,2018/4/10,5,I love this recipe and so does my family. To the person that said something about 3 star reviews. You are so right. I don’t get why someone does that. Review on THE recipe not on changes to the recipe. I love this recipe. Very good!
2002355720,496614,2018/12/4,2,"Tried this recipe exactly as written. Didnt love it, was more like cornbread and sweet. Nothing like a biscuit. Probally wouldn't make again, the family wasnt pleased."
1620171,504210,2013/11/10,5,"These were delightful and a wee bit decadent. I used some homemade apple pie jam for the filling. Made for your cookathon, may you rest in peace and always bring joy to the hearts of those who loved and knew you. P.s The flowers are for you, the cookies are for me :)"
28177,504210,2013/11/15,5,"Just like my Swedish gramma used to make!  I have always been partial to these cookies, but never make them for some reason.  I will now though.  They&#039;re really very easy.  So easy in fact, that my 7 year old DD actually made them.  The only thing I did was put in small dollops of jam and bake the pans.  I used boysenberry jam and Pammy&#039;s recipe #506915, which was just a little too watery to stay within the thumbprints.  Made and enjoyed in Pammy&#039;s honor.  We&#039;ll miss you."
1287956,518045,2014/8/28,3,"My family didn&#039;t like this one too well, but if I make it again, it&#039;ll go over mashed potatos instead of puff pastry.  I&#039;d also cut back on the A-1 sauce, which is odd because I usually drench my steaks in it."
1802737078,536575,2018/10/10,5,This recipe is excellent. I made exactly as the recipe states. My house smelled so good. It was like being in Olive Garden or Carrabba's. The recipe states it serves 4. It's really more like 6 unless you eat an awful lot.
2549237,496561,2013/10/8,5,This soup was so easy and great comfort food.  I cooked the chicken on low all day for about 9 hours and then finished the soup up in about an hour this evening.  My kids really loved the mushrooms and I loved the addition of spinach.  I also love that this is diabetic friendly as I am a Type I Diabetic and often find Diabetes friendly foods bland and boring.  Thanks for a great soup Annacia!  Made for PHOTO TAG FALL 2013.
1801425446,515280,2014/4/13,0,"I haven&#039;t actually made this recipe, but it certainly seems like an awful lot of steps prior to putting it into a crockpot.  If you have such a problem with dry rigatoni and meat and sauce when baking, why not just add more sauce????  Better than messing around with the crockpot for three hours."
266635,500441,2013/5/23,5,"This is one of our favorite sandwiches!  We used cajun turkey breast and some delicious fresh Farmer&#039;s Market tomatoes for this wonderful sandwich.  Of course the addition of the buttery avocado and the bacon really takes this sandwich over the top.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag, May, 2013."
242766,500441,2016/1/27,5,"Delicious!  I love BLTAT (bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, turkey) sandwiches, and this one with the addition of cheese was even better.  I doubled the ingredients to make two sandwiches and used a hearty multigrain bread.  The only change I made was to mash the avocado and add the mayonnaise to it before spreading it on the bread...yum!  Thank you for sharing!  **Made for 2015 Football Pool**"
425105,500441,2017/12/24,5,"What a fabulous sandwich. The flavors are great. Toasted white bread (I used English Muffin Bread), mayo, avocado, bacon, turkey, cheese. I didn't have provolone so I used mozzarella, and I didn't have lettuce so I left it out. Used deli roasted turkey done in house at a small independent grocery and pre-cooked bacon warmed up in the microwave. Yum!"
486725,500441,2018/2/13,5,"Avocado and bacon are always sure to please, but the real surprise was the cheese. We used Irish cheddar, and it really stood out flavor wise."
323186,513615,2014/12/5,5,"Totally yummy!!!!  I could eat Thai Noodles every night, made exactly like this!!   However, I did dress it up a bit, adding shrimp, spring (green) onions, peanuts, slivered zucchini -- um, oh, I also  made a small egg omelet and sliced it up ---   that was it. Totally delish!   I made enough so that I would have extras for my lunch today ;)    Sooo good, thank you Breezermom!!!"

39835,505569,2013/8/22,4,Very different and interesting dish which we enjoyed. I used soy crumbles for the pork but otherwise made as directed. Very interesting way to prepare eggplant. Thanks for sharing!
1663024,496163,2013/11/10,5,"I roasted a three and a half pound spaghetti squash at 450F degrees for one hour and then lowered the temperature to 350F degrees for one more hour. The outer skin became brittle hard and dark brown, but the inside was moist, tender, and sweet. Roasting for such a long time caramelizes the natural sugars in the squash developing a sweeter flavor than when the spaghetti squash is baked for a shorter amount of time like most recipes recommend. Furthermore, the longer baking time breaks down the plant cell walls allowing moisture to release causing the spaghetti squash to be more succulent and juicy than when it&#039;s cooked for a shorter time. The flesh slipped right away from the brittle skin without wasting one strand of squash. I recommend scooping out only the amount that you plan to eat and refrigerating the leftovers in the harden shell to preserve moistness. Thank you, Gluten Free Me, for a simple, healthy, and delicious recipe!"
1802594243,507621,2014/3/17,0,"I would like to try this recipe, but I can&acute;t find the amounts for the vinegar or the ginger."
157167,504340,2013/8/19,5,"This was a really interesting breakfast.  The egg plant rolls had a great flavor, although I had a hard time cutting even, thin slices.  It made for a very substantial meal, and it as quick and easy to throw together the salad and eggs while the eggplant cooled.  For ZWT9"
251917,504340,2013/12/31,5,"Aussie Swap #83: Now this is an unusual breakfast but OUTSTANDING! This is my kind of breakfast - veggies, eggs, cheeses - YUM!! Full of flavor!"

169430,504347,2013/9/2,5,"This made a very welcome light and refreshing lunch today. I had everything on hand and it was so simple to make. Used green pepper, mushrooms cut in half, small organic carrots, celery, broccoli bits and tiny grape tomatoes. The dip is delicious and would be good on a chicken sandwich too. :D"
482376,504349,2013/9/18,5,"Excellent! I only had time to marinate my chicken for 30 minutes, but those flavors still infused themselves. Great flavor. I also really loved brushing the buns with the olive oil mixture and grilling them. The roasted red pepper mayo was delicious and I&#039;m glad I have some left over to use for sandwiches. Thank you! Made for NA/ME tag"
2001292471,504361,2016/12/11,0,"Love these boller.. There's Shell petrol station on the way from Oslo\Gardemoen to Trysil, in the store they trade local food - sausage, honey and etc, and these boller, staffed with caramel, chocholate , rasins .. We always drive in. Perfect with Coffee or local strawberry flawoured mineral water. Sincere thanks for the receipt"
542159,504362,2013/8/18,4,Pam you are correct these carrots can be used as a side or an appetizer. These where a wonderful side to our Moroccan dinner and went really well with  Recipe #191057. There is a little left that I am thinking would make a good lunch wrap with some cool crisp veggies. Thanks for the post.
163112,504362,2013/10/16,5,"WOW!  I was worried about this...mashed carrots?!  But everyone LOVED this!  It&#039;s surprisingly &amp; wonderfully different.  The vinegar really kicks it up.  Very easy to make, too.  Made for Traveling Through Tunisia in the NA/ME Forum 10/2013."
2000296389,504366,2015/6/26,5,"Delicious.
I made this and used a whole scotch bonnet as well as adding in a 1tbs of white wine vinegar and the flavours take me right back to Mo&#039;Bay.
Served with a side of fried breadfruit.... Definately recommend this ."
1803703592,496163,2015/1/25,0,"&quot;Toss it in the oven&quot; is my kind of recipe. I have the day off tomorrow (translation: I have plenty of time to scrape exploded squash from inside the thing that heats up,) so tonight&#039;s the night. I have no idea how much the squash weighed, but it was pretty big. At 7pm, I put it in a casserole dish with about an inch and a half of water and shoved it in the oven on 350 degrees. I checked on it at 8pm, and it still seemed really roly-poly so I left it in. At 9, I pressed on the skin with the handle of a spatula and it seemed hard so I figured I&#039;d leave it in for one more hour. Then I forgot about it. For another two hours. When I realized my error, at 11pm, and pulled it out of the oven, I was surprised to find that it burnt, but not as burnt as the photo. I sliced into it and steam came out as if from an overheated radiator. Exciting! The burned bit was dry and stiff, and all the flesh was slumped in the bottom. I was worried that because I hadn&#039;t scooped out the seeds that it would be hard to get the flesh out, but it was easy enough. I also worried that the whole thing would smell like burned stuff but surprise- it was great! Yay! (I love it when food doesn&#039;t explode.)"
1802109244,504372,2014/1/9,1,"This is gross. I can&#039;t eat it because it&#039;s so unenjoyable. The texture is horrible. It&#039;s like a slimy marshmallow. Don&#039;t make it, it&#039;s a waste of time"
1802419093,504380,2014/1/29,4,It was amazing!!!!
1925885,504392,2013/7/30,4,"For such a simple recipe, this has great flavor!  I really like the preparation method, though I did have to finish the fish in the broiler to get the top to brown.  In spite of being yummy, my fish didn?t turn out so pretty, but no fault of the recipe.  Like other imported items, sometimes we don?t get the best quality, and so it was with this package of frozen cod, purchased in a rural area of Costa Rica, which was super thin and had suffered some freezer burn.  I will definitely make this recipe again, but perhaps with some fresh local fish like Corvina.  Thanks for posting, Pam!  Gourmet Goddesses ZWT9."
226863,504392,2013/7/30,5,"What a wonderfully easy recipe to make!  I really wondered, reading the ingredients, if this would work.  But it was super good!  That being said, I don&#039;t care for frozen fish, so I used freshly caught amberjack fillets, about an inch and a quarter thick.  Amberjack is a great-tasting dense white fish, similar to cod in color but a little tighter in texture.  The taste was wonderful in this recipe...the only thing I didn&#039;t care for was that the flour coating turned a bit &quot;slimey&quot;.  Maybe turning the broiler on at the end would help with that.  But I loved the wonderful lemon/butter juice that I could scoop out of the baking dish over the fish, and the broiler might dry that juice up.  Regardless, I absolutely loved the flavor and my fish was just wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game."
296809,504392,2013/7/31,5,"Made as written for the Goddesses of ZWT-9 &amp; the Seafood Cooking Challenge, this meal is a ?staple? of Icelandic dining &amp; a definite DH-pleaser ? Especially if your DH is a bit of a purist about his ?Icelandic staples?. I followed your suggestion &amp; served it w/a cucumber salad &amp; parslied potatoes w/carrots. We buy cod in 10 kg pks &amp; love finding new ways to enjoy it. This cod was moist, well-flavored, an ingredient-friendly easy-fix &amp; a tasty classic for the cuisine. Thx for sharing the recipe w/us."
895132,504392,2013/8/11,5,"Lovely dish! Made this with gluten free flour, and it turned out great. Easy to make and very tasty. recipe #504455 was the perfect addition. Thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Scandinavia for The Apron String Travelers"
37449,504392,2013/9/4,4,A nice dish to prepare and was tasty with the lemon flavor. Thanks Pam! Made for ZWT 2013 for team Hot Stuff!
227978,504392,2013/11/13,5,"So easy to prepare, yet so big on taste.  I really loved this!  It&#039;s amazing how much additional taste the little bit of paprika added to this dish.  But it was the buttery lemon coating that really made this so delicious, and the time was perfect and produced such a moist piece of cod that I really enjoyed.  Made for the 2013 pammyowl Cook-A-Thon in Pam&#039;s memory."
131126,504392,2013/11/16,5,The flour breading was still fairly wet at the end of 25 minutes so I flipped it and sprinkled again with paprika and baked 7 minutes more.  It seemed to help.  Served with Recipe #483458 and rice pilaf for a nice dinner in memory of pammyowl.
482933,504392,2013/11/22,5,Simply delicious! I omitted the flour and broiled a bit. Reminds me of poorman&#039;s lobster. Made in memory of Pammyowl.
655199,504392,2014/6/6,5,OMG....this was SOOOOOOO GOOD!!! This is the best oven baked cod ever....a DEFINATE KEEPER!!! THANKS for sharing!!!
373020,504393,2013/7/25,5,"We are in cauliflower season right now and what better recipe to try!  I didn&#039;t add the optional ingredients, but I did add 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese and the last 2 potatoes I had in the bottom of the cupboard (peeled and chopped small).  Served with fresh crusty bread. I think almost any left over veggies would be great in this (carrots, celery, sweet potato, broccoli, and even corn).  Thanks for posting, this is a winner!"
226863,504393,2013/11/17,5,"I really enjoy cauliflower, and this was a very easy soup to put together.  I followed the directions exactly, but didn&#039;t see where there was another cup of water to add, so I just added the chicken stock and milk.  I garnished with nutmeg and enjoyed a delightful lunch.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for the Pammyowl Cookathon."
266635,504393,2013/11/19,5,"This is a delicious creamy soup which makes a really nice lunch all on it&#039;s own or with a sandwich or salad.  I did add additional salt, pepper and a dash (or two) of cayenne.  Will definitely make again and will always remember &quot;Pammy&quot; when I make it.  Made for Pammyowl&#039;s Cook-A-Thon, November, 2013."
286566,506675,2014/2/23,5,"Love smoked salmon with scrambled eggs any time but takes it to whole new level when you stuff it into sweet vine ripened tomatoes with the slight saltiness from the goat cheese and capers and you have a 5 star recipe, thank you Chef for a great recipe, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
2000888358,525748,2016/2/23,4,"This was AMAZING!!! They were really delicious, and had the perfect amount of chocolate in the middle. Your recipe is amazing, I made 4 dozen for a birthday party and everyone loved them. Upload more PLEASE!!!"
1597832,525748,2016/2/24,5,Gooey and delicious!
2000888924,525748,2016/2/24,5,Oh my GOSH so very very very YUMMY!!! They are especially tasty right out of the oven served with berries &lt;3
2000889338,525748,2016/2/24,5,"This was AMAZING!!! I made these for my little brothers birthday party, and they were delicious. Everyone wanted more. P.S. You should add more chocolate, and more eggs."
2001187474,516610,2016/10/13,0,Added some fresh cranberries on top for a festive look!
515278,519190,2014/11/14,5,I decided to try this recipe because I had seen America&#039;s Test Kitchen (I think) recommend bread flour when making pizza dough. This crust is the best one that I have ever tried at home. Thank you so much for sharing!
2847194,501133,2013/6/1,1,"You say to put in the lemon juice and zest but there is no amount in the ingredients list. I had to guess, I put in about a tablespoon. The muffins were gross, I cooked for 20 minutes and they were still doughy on the inside. Wasted my chia seeds!"
1056692,521251,2015/5/9,4,"My kids loved this!  I used half flour and half oatmeal because I got this confused with another recipe, but it turned out fine.  Used yogurt rather than milk.  Make sure you use a large mug.  These rose to the top of my latte mugs before settling down a bit as they cooled.  I&#039;ll make these again for a fairly healthy treat for the kiddos.  Thanks for sharing."
2001815844,521251,2017/11/22,4,Mine didn’t work out as i thought.... next time i will use a bigger bowl and yougert. But it was good!
1802564954,522079,2015/5/20,5,Absolutely superb. Very easy. I was very skeptical about the  mustard but it worked well. Next time I will add mushrooms. yummo... Thank You for sharing.
2001529689,526150,2017/5/11,5,"This was one of the most flavorful recipes I have ever found online! ...and also the first I have ever bothered to review. I made a few minor substitutions. I used portobello mushrooms, a vidala onion, and cashew milk since that is what I keep in the house. I also used my homemade whole grain pilaf mixture in place of the farro; which I prepared in my rice cooker. I will be making this again over the weekend."
486718,503179,2013/9/8,4,This wasn&#039;t exactly like Chili&#039;s version but pretty good anyway.  Thanks!
1800245941,503179,2014/1/5,5,This is really yummy and pretty close to Chili&#039;s queso. We use Tostito&#039;s new thin Cantina chips with it and we haven&#039;t had to go back to Chili&#039;s since!
607820,503179,2016/8/12,5,Make this for Friday Night meal at our Quilt Retreat and everyone loves it. Made according to recipe.
1800536426,496129,2013/12/8,4,"I just created the same exact thing. I thought I was the first to invent this but apparently not. I googled it and found this recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyhow, the sandwich is 9/10 stars, rivaled only by a BLT. The advantage to this one versus the BLT is the cheapness of the ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suggest you throw a pinch of pepper over the egg once you get it into the pan. If you&#039;re using craft singles for cheese, you will need a napkin because that stuff will melt all over the place."
865936,501176,2013/6/21,5,"Love, love, love the creamy sauce!  I seasoned my chicken with Stubbs rub which worked out quite well. This is a definite keeper. Aaaaarrr!  Pieces o&#039;gold, indeed!"
1706426,500479,2013/8/29,4,"This recipe needs a bit of tweaking, but it was quite tasty! I found the vinegar solution was not enough to fill the jar, but that may have been because I didn&#039;t pack the veg tightly enough, so then I added more vinegar, so of course then it was too sour, so I had to add more sugar. Nonetheless it was a fun experiment!"
2667031,503179,2016/9/30,5,This is pretty darn close to the skillet queso at Chili's. I LOVE that stuff but don't go there very often. Now I don't have to. I use the thin OTB chips and it's perfect! My whole family loved this. This will be my go to queso recipe.
2001516053,503179,2017/5/2,5,Just slightly more robust flavor. I prefer it with beans in the chili.
2001837961,503179,2017/12/4,2,"Honestly I love chilis, I love to cook as well I followed the recipient, and I even added more spices because it did not taste anything like it at all, the only good part is the cheese"
226867,499490,2013/10/1,5,"Can I review twice to give this 10 stars? Well, this was fabulous and easy! I used less bacon than called for (actually 4 T. of bacon crumbles like one uses on salad), also only about 2 T. of bacon grease. DH loved it, too. Thanks AZ!"
280271,518972,2015/8/11,5,These are juicy...the cooking time was spot on...I cooked mine 3 mins on each side...and I cooked them in my cast iron grill pan...loved the flavor of the butter...thanks for posting this recipe...
2000659212,518972,2017/2/26,4,Excellent flavor ...when I make pork chops it's baked shake and bake or bbq sauce and onions..hard to cook chops and not end up high and dry. Great call on flavor mix!!! Thanks
169430,505086,2014/4/24,5,"This recipe is outstanding and was a commanding partner for your Moroccan Lamb and Date recipe. I could make a meal with just this!. I made just a single serving but wish that I had made more. All of the ingredients create a symphony of flavor and the texture of couscous is always pleasing. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
2002287311,505086,2018/9/29,5,"I didn't have all the ingredients and wanted to have a filling lunch so I mixed the recipe up a bit but really love it. I didn't have apricots or dates but an apple I needed to use. So I added that one, toasted some almond slivers and fried some chicken with more sesame and spice mix. I halfed the recipe since I am not making family meals but I am now happy to have this meal for today and tomorrow. Will make it again!"
275425,503997,2013/8/23,5,"Very very good! I am a big beans and greens fan, so I was excited to switch it up and try this recipe since I picked up a bunch of fresh black eyed peas at the farmers market and sice this sounded good. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By mistake I picked up hot chicken sausage instead of just regular old sausage and this recipe STILL earns all five of the stars. Very full flavors, and the calorie info is only true if you eat the he-man serving this poster suggests. Oh, and I replaced one of the quarts of stock with a quart of water since stock is pricey and it was still very, very good. I hardly ever log back in to just rate something but this just had to get some props. Thanks for posting! Make it! Will be sending it to all my family."
2000652733,508753,2015/11/8,5,"I love making this dish! Easy recipe to remember too. Although I have made this several times in the past with other recipe sites, I found this one the best. Tonight I made this for dinner and it was awesome! Added a flour slurry made with more wine and water, towards the end for a thicker type sauce. Served with garlic mashed potatoes."
2002000540,517292,2018/2/19,5,"I made this the other week following your recipe and it was delicious. Making it again today. I put on a bed of quinoa with roasted veggies, zucchini, brussel sprouts, peppers, asparagus, garlic, and onions. ??"
2906039,499782,2013/7/17,5,This was sooo simple and soooooo good.  It was not as thick as I like so I just did 2 tbs of flour and 1/2 cup cold water and it instantly thickened.  I would probably add more veggies next time...and I did add a little Mrs Dash lemon pepper and some parsley flakes.  this is a keeper!!!
143318,500472,2014/4/20,5,"Garden fresh is the perfect name - you won&#039;t want to eat canned tomato soup ever again!  I used freshly-picked tomatoes from the local Homestead farms, and did step #1 in advance and chilled overnight; the thick, intensely-flavored soup was ready very quickly the next day. This definitely could serve four. I used the leftovers as pasta sauce which worked great."
2002174421,535779,2018/6/9,4,The shrimp was delicious. I found the zucchini cup to be a little too doughy. I would maybe add less flour and use a little old Bay spice for some flavor.
1101802,535779,2018/6/30,0,"How much cornstarch? Half of what? Tbl, cup?"
2002203938,535779,2018/7/1,0,"I would LOVE to make these shrimp cups, but there are too many ingredient questions that are no posted in measurements. If this recipe gets tweaked so that it would be a success, I would love to make it for guests!"
2002204215,535779,2018/7/1,3,The only measurement missing is the cornstarch. I just sprinkled the cornstarch and stirred the shrimp
2000757467,535779,2018/7/4,4,Used approx. 1/2 c cornstarch. Did use 1 tsp old bay suggested by another review. Didn't have sweet chili sauce. So with 1 part mayo mixed 2 parts rooster garlic chili sauce and 1 Tbsp. Brown sugar.
2000888984,535779,2018/7/9,4,I skipped the cup and put this on a platter with toothpicks!
1802945805,535779,2018/7/10,0,haven't tried yet but I think I will use phyllo and/or wonton squares for the cups. too much fussing with the zucchini cups.
2001664226,535779,2018/7/12,0,Where is the recipe?
2002202055,535779,2018/7/23,5,Awesome
2002269653,535779,2018/9/8,0,"Turned out nasty and bland. The zucchini cups had too much flour and no salt or pepper!! I would take away about a half to two-thirds of the flour, add salt and pepper to the zucchini mixture and maybe even some smoked paprika. I also added some paprika to the shrimps, along with the cornstarch and salt. But I would have fried the shrimps in flour."
2001970443,533981,2018/2/3,4,"Added ice to thin it out a bit, the flavors were a bit too strong for me as is."
144373,501541,2013/8/11,5,"The fish was very flavorful, enjoyed it with the mango marinade sauce on it.  I made this recipe as written, except I only used 1 serrano chili, I also cooked the fish in the broiler. Made for ZWT9 ~ The Apron String Travelers"
381180,510764,2014/1/12,4,"The bread has a nice flavor.  Although the ginger is not distinctive at all, I do taste the peanuts and the sesame seeds I added.  Although I allowed the dough to double in size for the second rise, my bread is quite heavy and dense.  (I just don&#039;t have great results making bread with all whole wheat flour!)  I added 3 3/4 teaspoons vital wheat gluten (for structure) and 1 teaspoon lemon juice (to extend the shelf life). I also subbed sour cream for the yogurt, and because I only had 1/2 cup roasted peanuts, I added 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds. Baked in Pyrex at 350F for 40 minutes, which I believe was 5 minutes too long. Tagged for Rookie Recipes, due 01/16/13."
498271,510764,2014/1/16,5,"What a great bread recipe!  I used half wheat and half white flour and crystallized ginger.  The ginger/nut flavor is there but very subtle.  I mixed this with my stand mixer; I let the dough rise 1 hour, formed the loaf, another hour rise, then baked 30 minutes at 400 degrees.  The dough rose so high and the result was a lovely soft bread with a firm but not crunchy crust.  Great plain, in a sandwich, and toasted - loved it - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
2060112,498172,2014/10/19,5,"These are, hands down, the best pinto beans I&#039;ve ever had/made. I made them for the first time two weeks ago and I&#039;ve made them two more times since. The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly. Second time, I used pork belly since I didn&#039;t have any hocks. I do NOT recommend that; you must have some kind of smoked pork. Tonight I made them again although I didn&#039;t puree any of the beans and these were the best yet. All three times I did use my pressure cooker (after 24 hour soak, put all ingredients in pressure cooker, bring to high pressure and cook for 6 minutes then let the pressure naturally release)."
1742738,498172,2014/12/2,4,These are really good and it does need smoked meat to top it off.  Badia Spice Co. used to make a Pinto Bean Spice mix but have not seen it in the stores for a few years .I started to make my own and it does take the guess work out of getting the spice combinations just right.  Beans are just beans until you get spice mixture just right.  We eat a lot of beans!!
1803600148,498172,2016/10/9,4,It's a good recipe but I think they are better cooked on stove top and not in a crock pot which generally means there is no need for any pureeing since they thicken naturally. It's not that big a deal to stir every hour or so and about 3 hours cooking on low is usually long enough. Otherwise this is an excellent recipe that I use exactly.
2000819420,523650,2016/1/20,0,"Not a review, but a question.... What can I use instead Lentils, sever allergies keep me from eating most legumes."
1742738,497455,2013/4/19,5,I have made these 2 times.  Once w/ Simply Poatoes and once w/ shredded hashbrowns.  You can&#039;t go wrong with either type of potatoes.  Great side dish w/ sauted peppers &amp; onions or sauted cubed boneless chicken thighs w/ a slight hint of curry pwr.

2324285,493510,2013/2/12,4,"This was pretty good!  I'm not a big fan of European/American food, but this was well-flavored and refreshing.  The thyme was a nice touch and the broth turned out great, but I really could not taste the bacon in the stew.  I wish I had used oysters, but alas my store did not have any fresh ones.  I really think that they oysters would have made this dish exceptional!  [Reviewed for PLEASE REVIEW MY RECIPE]"
526411,511470,2014/2/19,5,"When I told my husband what I was making, he said, &quot;Can&#039;t you just make regular baked macaroni?&quot;.  But he really liked it, so it got five stars from both of us.  I didn&#039;t use rosemary.  I have never found fresh rosemary here, so I just left it out.  Also I have never found white cheddar cheese, so I used yellow.  The panko breadcrumbs were a great addition; I&#039;m sure they were much better than regular bread crumbs would have been.  I chose swiss cheese for this.  I made this for &quot;Name that Ingredient&quot; tag game for Winter 2014.  Thanks for posting this."

50509,505361,2013/9/6,5,"What fun! I&#039;ve made simple syrup any number of times, but never thought to flavor it with herbs. I used lemon thyme and a few leaves of pineapple sage. Wonderful in iced tea and also in hot tea. Will make more before we have a hard frost."

200877,505269,2013/9/25,5,"These brownies were delicious! Sweet, fudgey, and everything a brownie should be. If no one told you zucchini was in this, you would never know. Easy to make too. My 23 yr old, who hates zucchini and never eats it, ate and enjoyed these! I like that the recipe makes two pans, one to eat and one to share or freeze. I brought the second pan to work, and got lots of compliments and a request for the recipe! Thank you, Mary! Btw, Mary is right, these do not need frosting!"
2000753294,526065,2016/8/10,4,"Thanks for posting this. You're right that it's the recipe on the SP's website, and it makes a good cookie. BUT: The recipe in the SP cookbook is a little different, and I think it makes a better cookie. I just checked it; main differences: 12 TB butter, not 16; only 2/3 c APF; 3 cups oatmeal; 2 TB water; 1 egg. The orig recipe makes a cookie that is less cake-y and almost &quot;bend-y&quot; / a bit lace-y. Cheers."

47892,506892,2013/9/15,5,I used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and that was plenty for me. I chose a good quality rich Sumatra coffee bean for my coffee; half and half and local clover honey. A great &quot;eye opener&quot; coffee in the morning served in my brand new &#039;Lapis&#039; colored Fiestaware coffee mug. Love the flavor combination! Good work! Made for Veg Tag/September.
39835,506892,2013/9/15,5,"Great coffee! I added cinnamon and saffron to my beans (Starbucks blonde blend) and ground them together in the coffee pot - aroma was out-of-this-world when I poured a cup. I drink my coffee black, so skipped the sweetner. So good and so easy for a great cup of coffee! Thanks for sharing!"
804550,506892,2013/11/1,5,"Holey Buckets is this good! I almost fainted when I saw the price of the saffron, and it is a good thing DH wasn&#039;t with me when I bought it.

128473,506892,2013/11/22,5,"Another winner from the Coffee Queen.  Wow, was this good.  Loved that you could taste the saffron, cinnamon and honey.  Honey always seems to enhance the flavor of whatever seasoning we use.  Thanks so much for sharing another lovely recipe, that I will make again and again."
1680722,506892,2013/12/12,5,"A great choice coffe recipe again!&lt;br/&gt;I used Greek coffee, Greek safron (Greece is exporting a lot of safron!) and cinnamon from the Turkish shop.&lt;br/&gt;As I know that the cinnamon I used is very strong I reduced the quantity to 1/4 (as Cookgirl suggersted) and I think this was the perfect quantity.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for your delish and inspiring coffee recipes!"
542159,506892,2014/3/23,5,"Annacia you have some wonderful coffees posted but think this one is most definitely the best of the best. I loved the spice blend and even more enjoyed how soothing and relaxing this was. Thanks so much for the true delight, LOVED it so much that I wish I could give it 20 stars."
227978,522877,2016/7/28,5,"I made this to toss into a pot of steamed green beans, and I really liked it. It gave a tangy-tart finish to the green beans, and it went well with the Yakitori Chicken we had for dinner. I would love to try it again with broccoli or steamed squash. Thanks, Stacy G. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 (Japan)."
1802835678,517820,2014/8/14,4,"the recipe is good, but what comedian wrote the nutrition info?"
2000492493,517820,2015/9/23,2,"This recipe had a nice flavour and I like the idea of it, but I didn&#039;t find it turned out very well. I followed the recipe carefully but the result was very liquidy, and in fact there was alot of extra beyond the 5 half pints. It has alot of liquidy ingredients with the extra lime juice, so maybe it needs more boiling down before adding the pectin."
653438,507275,2013/10/20,4,"Made this for My 3 Chefs 2013 tag game and the only thing I did differently was to add some garlic and onion to the veggie mixture, fresh garlic to the broth mixture with brown sugar instead of honey (I didn&#039;t realize my honey was gone).  DH loved this dish and that&#039;s great because it really is a tasty and easy dish to prepare.  Thank you for posting."
251626,507275,2014/1/9,0,Everyone really loved it. I did substitute fresh onion and garlic and added some saut&eacute;ed chicken breast. Great
114027,504780,2013/8/11,5,"Loved the flavor of the marinade! It was a little sweet and a little spicy, and the chicken turned out sooo juicy! made for the Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT9"
58104,495475,2013/3/20,5,"Very nice dinner! But there is something amiss in the directions. I added the bay leaf to the potato water since it wasn&#039;t stated what to do with it. After sauteing the potatoes in oil with the garlic (I used roasted garlic) I fork mashed them with the cream. (Cream) also not stated what to do with it in the directions! As your photo looks like you didn&#039;t fork mash the potatoes but the title and step #10 states fork mashed potatoes. Oh When I strained the potatoes from the water I removed the bay leaf, black peppercorns but kept the garlic in. YUM! I used frozen green beans that I defrosted and sauteed in the butter along with citrus zest. Skipped the cold plunge using two lemons. I did heavy season the pork, browned stove top on a grill pan then finished cooking in a 350 degree oven till 145 degrees. I did have a lot of the compound butter left over so I`m thinking the fat intake is much lower. Thanks for a Delish meal"
2002290685,525922,2018/10/3,5,Saw these tarts being made on The Great British Bake Off and found this easy to make recipe online. They were OUTSTANDING!!! Make sure you follow all the steps (especially when you take the pastry out of the oven the first time) and you will have a true crowd-pleaser!!
653438,495369,2013/10/6,5,Made this for our dinner last night and I followed the instructions except I did sear the meatballs and used homemade marinara sauce.  What a delicious recipe! Thank you for posting.  DH really enjoyed these.  Made for My 3 Chefs tag game.
852554,502932,2013/7/21,0,This was not half but I would omit the Tabasco- I didn&#039;t think it added anything and I found over powered the pimms. I substituted homemade lemonade for the lemon juice and sugar. Made for zwt9
599450,502932,2013/7/22,5,"Refreshing, addictive, and delicious! Even picky DH loves this recipe. The Pimm&#039;s is on the table waiting the next batch. The only substitution was Sprite for 7-Up because that&#039;s what DH drinks. This is a summertime staple! Thanks, twissis -- fellow Gourmet Goddess! Made for ZWT9."
37449,509574,2013/12/3,5,"Halved the recipe, used homemade vegetable broth and really enjoyed this comforting dish for dinner along with coleslaw. Thanks!"
133174,509574,2014/8/20,5,"Yummy and delicious.  I increased the recipe to serve 6 and served it topped with Italian Sausage, Peppers and Onions.  Everyone said it was very creamy with lots of flavor.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
2001645989,509574,2017/8/30,5,This was wonderful--very simple but works well for polenta.
498271,503054,2013/8/4,5,"Great tasty drink, and pretty too!  I didn&#039;t use anywhere near 2 cups of OJ, just used enough to fill my glass leaving room for the rum/curacao.  Sweet, tangy and tropical - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
204024,503054,2013/8/4,5,I didn&#039;t have a glass big enough so had to cut each part down.  This was fun and tasty.  Made for ZWT9.
305531,503054,2013/8/11,5,"Yummy! This was such a nice drink for a sunny afternoon. I obviously need more practice on layering drinks based on my photo. lol. Thanks Dee, for another keeper. Made for ZWT9."
461834,495369,2013/10/28,5,"Great meatball recipe!!  I made this as written, although in a scaled back version.  I, too, made my own marinara sauce and seared the meatballs before adding them to the sauce.  I made these the night I tagged them, but DH surprised me by coming home early(causing me to have to add more pasta etc.) and I didn&#039;t take a photo and almost forgot to review them.  Served with a salad and garlic bread for a terrific dinner.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for your win in the football pool, congrats again!!!!"
255692,497880,2013/3/21,0,"This turned out great and I will definitely make it again, but next time I will probably add some garlic."
2893448,497880,2013/7/7,3,"This was easy and fun to make, but it tasted nothing like RL&#039;s cheddar bay biscuits. I think if I make it again I will shred the cheese and leave out both peppers- maybe also add some garlic salt."
10320,494930,2014/12/25,4,"We made these cookies for Santa. The recipe makes a good cookie airy and moist. These were not too sweet as most mall cookies tend to be. I reduced the stars because the baking instructions produces a flat cookie that takes 20 minutes to cook but does not produce that crispy edge I like on a cookie. I suggest to not reduce the temperature but rather reduce the time to 10 to 12 ,minutes for fresh cookie dough and 15 minutes for refrigerated dough."
373020,499974,2013/7/7,5,"Addictive and fabulous!  You will only want a small slice as this is very rich.  My FIL has made this many, many times and I am proud to say I made this one myself. Thanks for posting."
526666,503858,2013/7/22,5,"Simple and easy, this made a tasty one-pan meal. I followed directions as written, except I used chicken tenders, as it is what was on hand. I did reduce the browning and cooking time, so as not to dry the tenders out. This was satisfying and will certainly go into my &#039;easy weeknight dinner&#039; folder. Thanks for sharing, Pesto Lover!"
2000326132,528649,2016/10/27,5,"I still can't believe this is actually made of cake, AMAZING!!"
2002284378,528649,2018/9/25,5,PLEASE post a video of this somewhere!!
2002303490,528649,2018/10/17,5,this food brighten my day
2002304881,528649,2018/10/18,1,"I'm sorry about the 1 star....that's a mistake... I haven't made the cake yet...I have a question...it states when putting on the layers you start vertical and then horizontal......does anyone know what that means? I get the vertical part, but what layer do you put on horizontally?"
169430,503687,2013/7/16,5,"I love this recipe. Used Splenda brown and a good quality whole wheat bread. I&#039;m very happy with the result. It came out semi-firm, firm enough to cut into squares when cooled but not dry and really solid. The pecans are a great flavor addition and I like the texture that they add as well. I&#039;m glad that I made the full recipe. :D"
143721,503687,2013/7/16,5,Excellent bread pudding.  I loved the way the topping got kinda crunchy.  I used 3 8&quot; sub rolls that needed to be used.  Made for ZWT9 and The Apron String Travelers.
114027,503687,2013/7/27,5,"I loved this! the topping added a perfect crunch to the pudding. I had mine with ice cream, but a caramel sauce would have been nice too. Made for ZWT 9 for the Hot Pink Panthers."
58104,497467,2013/4/1,4,"Sweet and Tangy. I added 1/3 cup diced red bell peppers. I was in a rush making this and an oops happened! I added the 1/4 cup reduced sodium teriyaki to the sauce. But I did add to the filling as directed. My tarragon is just starting to grow so I didn`t have the full amount. I replaced the mascarpone cheese with home made raw milk ricotta cheese. This does make more like 8 servings. I think 1 cup of wine would have been plenty. The sauce was on the thin side. I suggest adding paste to thicken or simmer to reduce. Beef broth in place of the wine would be good. I did like using napa cabbage, just doesn&#039;t hold as much filling as white/green cabbage. I stuffed with 2-3 tablespoons of filling, stuffing 30 rolls. I was brought up eating Go??bki  which has white cabbage stuffed with a lot more filling. Using beef and pork. A nice take on my family traditional eats!"
256411,493247,2013/2/20,2,"not a keeper...didnt muck about making substitutions, made it *exactly* as directed, ...I didnt like it :("
12009914,524984,2015/12/1,5,"Love it!  The sausage, the egg, the pasta, the sauce, YUM!"
2000722440,524984,2015/12/1,5,Love this!
2000722468,524984,2015/12/1,5,"Excellent,  Cant wait to try. Looks delicious."
2201996,524984,2015/12/1,5,This looks MARVELOUS!
2000722599,524984,2015/12/1,5,This looks wonderful
2000722896,524984,2015/12/1,5,Great recipe as usual can always count on Isabell to create a tasty recipe
2000724034,524984,2015/12/1,5,Absolutely love it
2000724099,524984,2015/12/2,5,Awesome
2000722463,524984,2015/12/2,5,All my favorite ingredient&#039;s. It was delicious!
1226388,502975,2013/8/25,5,"This was a delicious stew!  It was simple to make and fast for a stew.  It would be easy to make on a week night, but delicious enough to serve to guests.  I had everything on hand to make this which is a bonus!  I did use regular couscous because I didn&#039;t have whole wheat, I&#039;ll try the whole wheat another time. Thanks for posting this, it is great for someone like me that is new to Moroccan food.  Made for ZWT9"
383346,502445,2013/7/17,5,This recipe is so good.  My son liked the taste of the salmon with the sweet taste.  It was perfect.  Thanks Elizabeth :)  Made for Rookie tag game
226863,498610,2013/4/20,5,"Such an easy dish to make!  I used the diced avocado option, and really enjoyed the avocado with the beans and corn.  I&#039;ll make this again as part of a Mexican meal.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game."
844554,498610,2013/8/9,4,This was a good side dish we had last night. I used garlic powder and left off the avocado and used green salsa we had in the fridge. Made for Rookie Tag Game 2013.
280271,498610,2014/3/4,4,This was a very tasty dish...I made as posted but would have preferred a bit of liquid in the dish...maybe keeping some from the can of corn or the beans...we felt it was a bit dry...but we enjoyed the flavors...I omitted both of the options because I served it over rice...used leftover recipe #322985...we had that for dinner a couple days ago...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
2000863766,498610,2016/2/8,5,"Very good
I added some taco seasoning
And it was just delicious
I served it over my rice"
2001062007,527378,2016/7/4,5,The Peanut butter cookies are good and what i did i had combine chocolate and peanut butter i them but they was so good i made my midnight snack when i wake up real late....
865936,499408,2013/5/14,4,"We really enjoyed the appearance and flavors if this dish. I used a natural peanut butter so the sauce was not sweet, but the bananas were!  I liked all the vegetables in this. I intended it as a side dish, but the portions are very generous and it makes a satisfying main dish.  Made for &quot;My Food Odyssey&quot; - Angola."
226867,499408,2013/6/22,4,"This was a flavorful, easy dish. I did add some chicken left over from another dish, but otherwise followed all the directions. I think the thing that made it 4 stars not 5 was that I&#039;m such a plantain novice that I chose a green plantain (actually the one at the store that looked the most yellow-y) and it was quite hard, dry and had no flavor. It was like tiny hockey pucks adorning the rest of the ingredients. I will make this again if I ever score some black plantains!  Made for My Food Odyssey 2013"
2001949278,499408,2018/1/23,3,"This dish I compiled for a project on Angola and I needed a simple, inexpensive dish that would satisfy my co-workers. This dish is not particularly astounding, yet it's oriented well and ultimately carries an exotic and savory taste."
386585,505848,2013/8/20,5,"This was a very flavorful soup that has an interesting combination of root vegetables.  I made this exactly as posted, using red lentils (which is what I had on hand).  I was rather generous with the cayenne though.  I think this would be especially nice in the cold weather months, and is a great change of pace from regular vegetable soups.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
333017,515352,2014/9/11,5,I was following a recipe that I had found in Pintrest.  What tweeked my interest was that you could make this into a Layered Greek Dip with the hummus as the base!   The hummus was lacking in the taste department and needed fixing...so I found this recipe and adapted my recipe to this one.  I used 1 whole lime juice instead of lemon. upped my garlic and added more salt and pepper.  The addition of tahini was the kicker!  My recipe was &quot;ho-hum&quot;...this recipe rocked!  I will come back to this one again!  P.S.  I really didn&#039;t notice the difference between white beans and the more traditional chick pea as far as taste was concerned.  Both would be equally delicious!!!  I served this with Olive Oil and Sea Salt Pita Chips
383346,501787,2013/7/16,5,I used only 1/8 cup of sugar.  It&#039;s perfect.  It was a little bit hard to put in a circle.  I added a little bit of flour to help me.  The taste is very good.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for PRMR tag game
2001992595,535571,2018/4/28,0,"OK, the title says &quot;bourbon-apple&quot; but the recipe talks about PEACH MOSTARDA. I'm confused. I watched the video and the apples looked amazing, but the recipe gives no joy. What's up with this?"
87870,528613,2016/10/31,4,"Well I tried them but my mistake, I filled the muffin tins to high The cream cheese mixture never melted into the muffin even though I did mix it with a toothpick. Not pretty but tasted good. I'm giving this a 4 star rating for taste, can't comment honestly on appearance because I goofed!"
2000031326,528613,2017/9/10,0,"Autumn is my fav time for pumpkin muffins and various breads. Today is the day for 1sts...1st muffin of the season, and 1st time I made cream cheese pumpkin muffins. Delish! This recipe is a keeper!"
266635,528613,2018/11/10,5,These muffins are wonderful and deliciously moist and flavorful. Made just as directed and they turned out perfectly. What a nice treat for breakfast along with a cup of coffee. Will definitely make these muffins again.
280271,504082,2013/7/27,4,We had mixed reviews in the family...I really enjoyed the flavors while hubby didn&#039;t care for the tequila taste in his slaw...he&#039;s set on the old heavy mayo type of slaw...I thought this was a nice change from the norm...thanks for posting it...=)
1802504021,504082,2014/2/18,5,Used this slaw on grilled mahi-mahi tacos with a dill dressing...fabulous!! Thanks
47892,504082,2015/5/6,5,"This was quick and easy to prepare and we loved the taste! I used green and red cabbage and some carrot in my slaw. I thinned the dressing with about 2 tablespoons of half and half. &#039;El Jimador&#039; tequila a~nejo was the tequila of choice. The cabbage, carrots, cilantro and green onions were all from our weekly CSA box which meant this was a very fresh salad! Cover and chill several hours for best flavor.  Good alone and also as a topping on simple beef tacos. Thanks for posting! Made for the Bevy Tag."
594620,522944,2016/7/21,5,"My children love Nutella but we avoid GMO foods at all cost. Needless to say, they've been without their beloved spread for a few years now. THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE! It is delicious and healthy when made at home with this fabulous recipe! YUM. Everyone should try this one. It's DELICIOUS."
724631,512615,2014/3/22,5,"Wonderfully different, a cross between cornbread and rye bread, no wonder that this is one of the favorite recipes in the King Arthur Flour Baking Book.  We each had 2 waffles (the mix made 9) and were full, thanks to the whole grains.  (BTW, I used rye flour I had ground myself because I make so much rye bread.)  An idea to try next time is to separate the eggs, and fold in whipped whites with the baking powder and baking soda; that should make the waffles even lighter.   Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2001803561,512615,2017/11/18,0,"They came out very well, and didn't stick nearly as much as the recipe suggested. I have two suggestions and a question. I prefer when the ingredients are listed in the order they are used. The lemon juice should be near the bottom of the list. Also, an error crept into the nutritional analysis - this is not a single serving recipe. It made about 8 waffles in our Cuisnart round waffle maker. You might scale this down... I'm not eager to eat a 2,400 calorie waffle. Also, it's not clear why the salt, baking powder and baking soda are stirred in at the end. Usually, these get sifted into the flour. Similarly, the lemon juice is usually mixed in with the milk at the beginning. I made it the way it was written and it came out great, but I am curious. Thanks, Mike"
1800088216,499133,2013/9/30,5,"This is one of the best cakes I&#039;ve ever made. I made the usual substitutions based on what I had on hand - used strong French press coffee, some white wheat flour &amp; some cake flour, 1/3 cup of carrots for some of the banana, drizzled with a powdered sugar, coffee syrup, milk glaze. It&#039;s like a mocha, banana devil foods bundt cake. Delicious!"
2655393,494116,2013/1/24,0,"I cook for the heart soup today! It was easy, fast  And rich, I like the clear broth And the vegetable where flavorful ! Very tasty I will defetinely add this to my weekly men? it is so healthty And very very good, I love the last part topping It with Hidden original ranch dressing!"
126440,519395,2014/11/11,5,Loved this dish.  Had to use spinach for the arugula but otherwise as written.  Loved how all the ingredients melded together for an explosion of flavors.
2710214,514995,2014/3/31,5,"Absolutely incredible.This recipe has it all, Can be an appetizer or a side dish."
1802644726,514995,2014/4/5,0,Awesome and easy
2192460,514995,2014/4/7,5,Beautiful presentation and the perfect complete bite!

679953,504430,2013/8/28,5,"Seeing that my daughter had soccer practice tonight, and other parents have bought their small bbq grills to the parking lot to avoid late dinners, I bought mine and this was our dinner outside the school.  The adjustments I made was before school let out, I brushed the olive oil onto the chicken thighs before cooking letting them marinade for about 45 minutes to an hour,,left out the salt, used only a half green pepper, and used some foil on the grill.  Needless to say these turned out nicely, we all enjoyed these, as they were definately flavorful.   There were 4 of us, and they made some big sandwiches, as there was alot of action on my grill seeing that my portable grill is a bit smaller, but it worked out well.  My daughter gets a 15 minute break during practice, as she enjoyed hers too."
266635,504430,2013/9/16,5,"These sandwiches are easy to cook and put together.  The only change I made was to use chicken breasts vs. thighs (only because that is what I had on hand).  I also added a little spicy seasoning to give the sandwich a little &quot;kick&quot;.  These sandwiches make a great lunch or football/party sandwich.  Made for PRMR, September, 2013."
369715,504430,2013/9/17,4,I used frozen chicken cheesesteaks but followed the rest of the recipe as written other then I didn&#039;t use the oil in my pan. I also added some red peppers as I had them on hand. We enjoyed these.
212609,504430,2013/11/11,5,"YES...this was a great chicken cheese steak....&lt;br/&gt;Had to use breast instead of thigh to keep DH happy...but happy he certainly was, after wolfing down one of these!!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
2549237,504430,2014/2/24,4,"I followed this recipe exactly as directed and these sandwiches came together very quickly.  I think my onion was a little large because there were a lot more onion than peppers and chicken, but that&#039;s ok because my family loves our onions.  The only thing I might do differently is to add some crushed red pepper flakes so that there&#039;s a little spice.  Thanks for another great recipe nochlo.     Made for PRMR."
2597942,504430,2014/3/26,5,"Okay... this was great! We normally buy the frozen &quot;Chicken Teriyaki Cheesesteak&quot; sandwiches from Wal-mart, but I decided to try these tonight... and I&#039;m so glad I did. It was very easy (and cheap) to make, and so yummy. However, I did use bone-less skin-less breasts instead (since hubby came home with 15 lbs of it, because it was on sale for $0.99/lb). The only comment of disappointment from hubby was that it was lacking the &quot;teriyaki sauce&quot; (that&#039;s how Wal-mart sells theirs), otherwise, he enjoyed them as much as I did. I promised him that next time I make these, I will add in some teriyaki sauce just before the meat and veg are done. LOL. Thanks for posting. (Made for PRMR) P.S. I forgot to mention... if you &#039;partially&#039; freeze the chicken, just prior to making these, you can slice the meat very easily and thinly."
542159,495340,2013/3/1,3,Was really excited to try this and did enjoy although it did not live up to the anticipation. Recipe states it serves 4 but only calls for 1 egg and 1/4 of each veggie which would not have been enough to make 4 nests so I doubled the veggies and used 2 eggs to feed the two of us. For us we felt the sauce over poured the rest of the meal. Thanks for the post and good luck in the contest.
174096,495340,2013/3/2,4,"This was a really tasty dish!  And a nice way to get some extra veggies in by starting at breakfast.  I did not use the optional radish and used green onion.  The only issue I had was with serving size.  It says the recipe serves 4, but there is only 1 egg and the other quantities seemed small.  So I made the recipe exactly as stated, but used it to serve only 1, which I found to be quite satisfactory.  I think with an adjustment of serving size/ingredient quantities, this would be a great dish I would make again.  Thanks, and good luck!"
2001039993,535102,2018/2/20,5,"Instead of making these as cookies, I made the shells out of cream puff dough and did everything else the same. Very light and airy and the peach flavor and the look is still there. Wonderful springtime desert recipe."
2002026576,535102,2018/3/3,0,"Hi, for the pastry cream, what is half and half?"
1675225,497218,2013/6/13,4,"Very nice flavor and easy!  My flounder didn&#039;t brown in the 15 min., but was done, so I had to broil for a min. or 2.  Medium to large flounder pieces would probably work better than my small ones in this recipe.  Will definitely make again."
128473,495340,2013/3/2,5,"This was easily one of my favorite recipes that I tried in this contest. I was so impressed with it, the flavor and textures were amazing.  The sauce lingered nicely in your mouth, making me wish I had more.  Were the ingredients off, yes, but I didn't care, I made the entire amount for myself and enjoyed it tremendously, it was an excellent breakfast.  The sauce was the crowning glory for me, drizzled over the soft cooked egg, I thought that it was perfect, complimentary not over powering. I loved that sauce, so good.  I did omit the optional radishes.  Good luck in the contest."
131126,495340,2013/3/3,5,"I thought this was cute presentation and I thought the idea of veggies and eggs was a creative contest idea. My egg was well done due to a runny egg aversion, but the sauce and veggies kept things moist.  The recipe was delightful, different, and delicious! It ended on my favorites list from the contest. Thank you for sharing your recipe and good luck!"
239758,495340,2013/3/3,4,"I made this delicious recipe for breakfast. There were two of us, so I doubled the veggies and eggs, but made only one batch of sauce. Great use of contest ingredients. Love the tang. The only shortcoming is that the recipe says this is for four, when really it is for one only. Good luck! It was my good luck that I tried this."
2000498330,512939,2016/10/10,5,Lovely soft textured bread. I sliced thick and served with stew. Very happy.
37449,507504,2013/10/8,4,"I had all the ingredients and this was a great way to use them. I did sub toasted almonds for the pistachios and used a brown rice mix. Much enjoyed, thanks!"
486725,507504,2013/11/1,5,"This is so tasty for being so quick with so few ingredients! I used less oil and the whole can of tomatoes. I thought a whole tablespoon of za&#039;atar might be a lot, but it was perfect, and the dish had lots of flavor. Two of us ate this as an entr&eacute;e, and it was satisfying - but I could see it feeding at least twice as many people as a side dish with grilled chicken or fish."
266635,505492,2013/11/1,5,"Awesome!  Love the coconut flavor to this pudding -- it really takes traditional banana pudding to another level of deliciousness .  You might think this would be overly sweet with the addition of cream of coconut, but it isn&#039;t.  Will definitely make this dish again!  Made for Cooking Tag Mania, November, 2013."
280271,507323,2014/4/13,4,These wings were tasty...but I didn&#039;t think they were sticky...more like gooey...I was expecting a thin sticky glaze...but I should have known with all the cornstarch that...that wasn&#039;t going to happen...the flavor is very Asian...I liked the idea of broiling the wings first...but they didn&#039;t hold up the crispiness in the sauce...the sauce thicken very quick that I had to add a touch of water to thin it enough to get the wings covered...Made for Spring 2014 PAC
88099,505734,2013/9/1,5,This is one of the best chicken marinades that I have ever made.  The peanut butter and soy sauce do not dominate the flavors as so many do but just add a great little touch.  I can&#039;t describe the flavors as it is so unique to me but is just absolutely wonderful.  Hope someone else can explain it better than I can.  I did microwave the peanut butter for about 30 seconds to help incorporate with the other ingredients more easily.  Other than that I made as directed.  I way overcooked my 4 chicken thigh pieces but it still turned out so moist and juicy.   I apologize for the photo but didn&#039;t like the photos of the marinade.   Thanks so much for sharing.

169430,503235,2013/8/19,5,We&#039;ve finally been having a heat wave up here in the north country and I&#039;m really enjoying it. I came across this recipe yesterday and had to try it. I set it up in the afternoon and had a glass this morning. It works and tastes great. Made for ZWT 9 :D
852554,503235,2013/8/21,5,"Awesome! With a teething toddler, I&#039;ve needed a jolt in the morning and this was so good - reminded me of vietnamese iced coffee. Made for ZWT 9."
80353,503235,2013/8/24,5,"This is the bomb!  Effortlessly get good, strong coffee that you can use in your favourite iced beverage.  Exactly what I need - and way better for me than the instant coffee I usually use to make my iced drinks.  I&#039;m going to try varying the extract when I&#039;m done with this batch.  Even though the vanilla is great (you can add more than called for), I&#039;m thinking it would also be awesome with almond or hazelnut.  Thanks for a very good recipe."
37449,503235,2013/8/25,5,Yum.  I used decaf and did not wait the whole 12 hours. Made for ZWT 2013 for team Hot Stuff.
67728,503235,2013/8/26,5,"Started this before bed so it would be ready in the morning. I wasn&#039;t sure that this would be sweet enough for me (I like a little coffee with my milk and sugar, lol), but surprisingly, it was. Whoo-eee, is this ever &quot;kicky&quot;, though! If you&#039;re on the caffeine-sensitive side like me, you might want to consider using a lighter brew coffee, or even decaf. I used Colombian dark roast coffee for mine. My to-go iced coffee cup is pretty big, and I made the mistake of filling it up. It tasted so good that I finished the whole cup, but my hands were shaking for hours after my coffee was gone! I think if anyone had stood next to me in a quiet room, they would&#039;ve heard a slight hum from me vibrating because I was so caffeinated, LOL. With that said, I would definitely make this again, but I would use a MUCH smaller cup. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9"
228458,503235,2013/8/30,5,"This is SO. GOOD. I might be twitching a little as I type this because I can&#039;t seem to stop drinking it LOL. Good thing I made it half caf! I cut the recipe down to 2 oz of coffee and I really wish I hadn&#039;t. I will definitely make this again, in fact I&#039;m pretty sure this is on its way to my Best of 2013 cookbook :). Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
128473,503235,2014/6/2,5,"This was so good, I made half the recipe and wished I had made the whole recipe instead, next time.  I loved how easy it was to make.  I let it sit overnight and enjoyed it in the morning and afternoon.   I used Starbucks Bold French Roast Coffee, it was wonderful prepared this way.  The condensed milk makes it very rich, sweet and creamy.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, that I will make again."
37449,511236,2014/1/20,5,I used a little purple cabbage too and almond milk. Yummy! Thanks! Made for New Kids on the Block game.
37449,505705,2013/8/20,5,I love eggplant cooked like this and enjoyed this dish with rice. Thanks!

126440,494529,2013/2/5,4,Quick easy meal.  Just made three and still have leftovers as they are very filling.
226867,493461,2014/8/11,5,"Very yummy, I think I must have used more of the dark green leek leaves than necessary b/c it&#039;s a creamy green color, but who cares! Made for Culinary Quest 2014"
163112,493461,2014/9/24,4,We&#039;re huge fans of potato leek soup so it would be hard to go wrong.  I think using more leeks in place of &#039;regular&#039; onions would be better.  We prefer ours chunky so I didn&#039;t puree.  I wondered about adding the chili powder but it was delicious!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ.
482376,493461,2015/3/18,5,"Oh so good! I love that this soup is so creamy, yet doesn&#039;t use any cream. It is flavorful, creamy and filling. It&#039;s also pretty easy to prepare. A winner all the way around. I added salt and a bit of pepper to the soup at the end of cooking. Thank you!"
128473,493461,2015/8/4,5,Wow was this soup good.  We really enjoyed its creamy texture and flavor.  It was quick and easy to make with excellent results.  I would be happy to serve this to family and friends a like.  I also added salt and pepper at the end.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will make often.  Made for Culinary Quest - Switzerland - 2015.
169430,493461,2015/8/6,5,I had (past tense) a leek in the veg drawer wondering what it was going to be. When I sew this I knew right away that it was destined to be soup. That leek became a very good soup indeed. Flavorful. satisfying and simple. What more could you ask? Made for Culinary Quest 2015 and the love of soup.
37636,493461,2015/8/26,5,"Very good potage, especially for being dairy-free."
2000568556,493461,2017/3/17,5,"Hate to review a recipe when I didn't follow directions exactly as stated, but I'm sure if I had... it would still be just as yummy. I'm reviewing this mainly for those who are on a low carb diet or just trying not to eat starchy potatoes. I doubled the leeks and did not add the potatoes. I followed the directions on this recipe as stated, but sauteed the extra leeks and when it came time to put it all together with spices, I simply did not add the potato. I also skipped the puree step because I did not add the potatoes. This was AMAZINGLY delicious!!!!!!!! Of course, without the potatoes, it's more of a broth soup, but by doubling the amount of leeks, it has more substance. Leeks are a hard vegetable to find good recipes for and this is definitely one to try!!! I made this 3 times now and just last night, I added some chopped up leftover roasted chicken from the previous night's dinner to the leek soup and added a totally new dimension to this soup! My advice is to take this soup as a base (have it as stated), or be a little creative with it!"
2001798125,493461,2017/11/18,5,Very savoury - excellent flavours - easy to make and delicious for a November chilly day - hits the spot!
2001908075,493461,2018/1/2,1,"Did not enjoy this recipe, I'm actually disappointed I wasted my time making it. Thyme has a strong earthy flavour, as do leeks naturally. While the two complement each other the thyme is over powering and there are no flavours to add a flavour contrast this soup desperately needs."
253884,513549,2015/1/8,5,This is truly delicious. The filling is so good! I bake mine at 375 until top is golden brown. It came out really nicely. My only problem is the filling is oozing out but I pushed it back using a spatula and spread it like a spread. I do not want to waste the filling coz it is very delicious. I hope you guys will try this. Thank you a dash of Love for sharing this wonderful coffeecake. :)
2000431901,519723,2017/1/6,4,"Very sweet, but good."
2001038255,519723,2017/3/4,5,"Very good! I made it exactly according to the recipe. I do recommend adding more jalepeno, maybe a whole one, because half was not spicy at all. Other that that, great recipe!"
383346,497582,2013/5/1,4,This is very easy to do.  I like the taste of the coconut in it but less the banana.  So another time I may try only with coconut.  I used pure maple syrup instead of agave syrup.  Thanks duonyte :)  Made for PRMR tag game
542159,497582,2013/11/12,4,As a dessert not so sure but as a breakfast what a nice healthy and tasty way to start the day. No an overly sweet pudding which is part of why I liked having the left over for breakfast but DH poured more sugar over his (eye roll). Topped mine with a little additional banana and coconut which is not as pretty as mint or berries but was what I had on hand. Thanks for the post.
305531,504942,2015/2/5,5,"This was so yummy! I&#039;m used to having potatoes in my stews and almost bypassed this recipe because of that. I honestly didn&#039;t miss them at all. Loved the combination of flavors and added a little bit of yellow squash since I needed to use some up. As with most stews, this got even better the next day. Thanks for sharing this great keeper, breezer. Made for For Your Consideration tag."
313633,504942,2018/11/26,5,Wow this is an awesome recipe. Just realized I forgot to rate it this is the 3rd time I will be making it. Everyone in my home loves it. Thank you for posting.
1802549429,499152,2014/3/4,4,"I made this tonight but with chicken,squash, zucchini, mushrooms and peppers and it was really good next time though I will use a little less ginger cause the ginger is pretty strong to me thanks for posting this recipe"
169430,513460,2014/4/17,4,"I was given some instant tea a good while back. When I came across this recipe I thought Ah-Ha a chance to try the tea. It&#039;s pretty good, I know the spices helped a lot. It made a nice fast cuppa that I didn&#039;t feel bad about as I used Splenda for the sugar. I didn&#039;t have vanilla creamer but just the plain kind so I just added a few drops of pure vanilla to my cup. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
4439,513329,2014/3/12,3,"Liked the chops, did not love. Next time, no hot peppers, just a shot of sriacha at the table. We thought the peppers were too bitter."
226863,515629,2014/5/11,5,Enjoyed this recipe this morning for Mother&#039;s Day.  Added a bit of horseradish to it as well to give it a little bite.  Thanks for sharing a yummy bloody mary recipe!  Made for PRMR tag game.
527607,515629,2014/6/9,4,"These were delicious and I loved them but my partner didn&#039;t, which was ok because I got two then :)"
305531,515629,2014/9/26,5,"Yum! Really good. Next time I will follow breezermom&#039;s idea and add a bit of horseradish since I like them spicy. Thanks for sharing, Nancy. Congrats on your first football win!! Wishing you many more!"
128473,515629,2015/6/8,5,"Very tasty Bloody Mary Nancy, I enjoyed it very much.  Love the Montreal Steak blend in here, it adds a nice little zing.  I did add a little horseradish to the cocktail also and found it was perfect in the drink. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe, that I will enjoy again.

725146,505575,2013/9/4,3,"I stumbled on this recipe after accidentally clicking on someone&#039;s profile while reading a post on Facebook. I *love* chocolate, especially easy to make chocolate, so I made a special trip to the store to pickup the chocolate chips and shredded coconut just so I could make this. It was incredibly easy to make but we just didn&#039;t like it as it was overly sweet. The only flavors we tasted were honey, chocolate and coconut (I strongly suspect that you could use milk chocolate chips in place of the honey and dark chocolate chips) -- we couldn&#039;t taste the peanut butter or the oatmeal and never noticed the walnuts. Despite it setting up fully in the fridge we ate these with a spoon they will melt in your fingers. They do melt in your mouth which I found quite interesting but we will not be making these again."
1458727,501928,2013/6/19,5,"This fast and easy.  I made this for me knowing DH does not like chickpeas.  So he comes into the kitchen and asks what is that?  Then proceeds to taste it, and wow he loves it.  So I made another double batch.  Its a big hit and healthy too.  Thank You for the recipe."
342524,506787,2013/9/13,4,"Easy to put together. I was a little leery on how this would taste simply because my chicken wouldn&#039;t brown. I let it stay in the oven for an extra 5 minutes or so to try and get it to brown, but didn&#039;t want to overcook it. It was crispy and good, browned or not. We enjoyed it and my 9 year old son said we have to make our chicken like this from now on. Thanks for sharing!"
1800132047,506787,2013/10/23,5,Very tasty however I Added more spices and broiled to add a crispy texture. My husband loved it and asked me to keep this one!
204024,506787,2014/4/12,4,Easy and healthy version of chicken parmesan.  I also let this cook an extra 5 minutes to get it to brown.  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
2000176524,506787,2015/4/30,5,"Straightforward, with a tasty, crunchy crust surrounding a juicy center.  :)  If I had to nit-pick, I was short a little bit of the breading mixture.  It could have been the way I sliced the chicken breast.  I would probably increase the amount of breading and spices next time just to be on the safe side.  Otherwise, I&#039;m very pleased with the results!"
2000773747,506787,2015/12/24,5,"I have made this recipe twice and both times it came out amazing! I adjusted a few things to use what I had on hand: instead of Italian herbs I used Herbs de Provence, and I didn&#039;t have garlic powder, so I chopped up two cloves. On my second run, I added truffle salt.  Frickin&#039; awesome!"
2000863160,506787,2016/3/12,5,I used chicken breasts instead.  My family liked it!  Served it with side of pasta and spaghetti sauce.
2001294630,506787,2016/12/12,5,"Crunchy outside, juicy inside! This was the best panko or breaded chicken recipe I have tried. I added a bit of cayenne pepper to the seasonings for a little kick. I served it with pasta, marinara sauce, &quot;magic broccoli&quot; (worth looking for this recipe), and homemade garlic bread. Will definitely make again!"
2001354032,506787,2017/1/16,5,"This came out great! The crust was delicious and crunchy and all of the chicken was perfectly cooked. I used gluten free panko bread crumbs and just fresh grated Parmesan cheese (the kind that comes in a little tub) and I added a little garlic olive oil to the eggs, and some paprika and celery salt, basil and oregano instad of Italian seasoning. I also sprayed the cookie sheet with olive oil, which seemed to add a nice browning to the crust. I cooked it for 30 min and turned them at 15 min. Some of us used blue cheese dressing or siracha chili sauce for dipping. We served it with tomato soup and salad. Some of my adjustments were for a low FODMAP diet."
2000793677,506787,2018/4/9,5,Delicious
226863,498193,2013/4/22,5,"Quick way to get in some comfort food!  It does taste a bit like the &quot;boxed stuff&quot;, but soooo much better.  Really enjoyed this, and the leftovers heat up well too!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Rookie tag game."
2549237,498193,2013/4/24,5,"This recipe is so good and so much better than the boxed stuff.  It is similar to what my mother called goulash.  It tasted very authentic to what my Sicilian mother would serve up frequently.  I doubled the recipe so that we would have leftovers for a couple of lunch and used 1 pound of mild bulk sausage because I only had 1 pound of hamburger when I went digging in my freezer, but kept the recipe the same besides that.  Thanks so much for a keeper!  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag ~Spring~."
131126,498193,2013/4/25,5,"True comfort food and similar to mom&#039;s goulash.  I liked the spices in this recipe. I threw in some sliced button mushrooms, a third pound of mild italian sausage and served with a large green salad.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
329769,498193,2013/5/4,5,My family enjoyed this for dinner tonight- 5 stars from my wheat and meat eating family. Looked so much tastier than the bought versions :)  Reviewed for Make My Recipe game in the Aus/NZ Forum
128473,498193,2013/6/10,5,"This is a lovely recipe Miss Fannie.  My dh &amp; I enjoyed it very much.  Quick, easy and very comforting.  I used a 4 cheese tomato sauce and made the recipe exactly as written.  A very tasty meal served with cornbread muffins.  Thanks for sharing another winner."
1802634379,502536,2014/3/31,5,"Wonderfully flaky crust, a do all with this. Sweet or savoury you choose!"
2000216260,502536,2015/5/21,0,"Thank you, this looks fantastic. I have found a nice trick for the base to keep it crispy and to really get the flavours of the tomato sauce out. Simplest, spread a little olive oil onto the crust before adding the sauce. Another good way, add a little sauce, let it soak in, spread a little olive oil over that and then add the rest of the sauce."
2001865348,502536,2017/12/17,2,"NOT FLAKEY at all!!! It does have a good taste but overall, given the amount of butter I'm ingesting, i'll take the serious eats pizza dough recipe which is much healthier."
2001963484,532338,2018/1/30,0,This sounds dangerously sweet and delicious! How ‘bout adding some hot pepper???????
369715,504135,2013/8/17,4,"I made this as directed but family didn&#039;t think it tasted any different then regular tacos. So they were good, just not anything different."
1022861,519635,2016/8/11,5,"The parmesan ranch coins are the most awesome ever! They are way easier to make than those that you dip in egg and biscuit mix and then fry in butter and oil. Just cut up your zucchini coins, coat them with the ranch dressing, put them on a greased cookie sheet, sprinkle the shredded parmesan on the coins, and put them in the oven for 10 minutes at 475. Easy pure awesomeness!"
2002033166,519635,2018/3/6,4,"This recipe wasn't as yummy as I anticipated. The zucchini came out the right texture and was nicely cooked, but the parmesan didn't cook well. Didn't look much like the picture. Mind you, I'm the worst cook in the Western Hemisphere. I used a low quality parmesan. I think I'll get some better parmesan, and maybe switch to broil for a few minutes at the end and see if I get better results. Still, it was an easy recipe and I do love zucchini."
128473,495326,2013/3/2,5,"We really enjoyed this tasty, quick and easy to make soup.  It made for a great lunch on a very cold winter day. It had a nice flavor, great texture, was well seasoned and  the combination of vegetables, herbs and spices was spot on.  It was a very comforting and satisfying dish.  Really great use of contest ingredients, good luck in the contest."
1422300,495326,2013/3/3,5,"We love warm soups and had never made a black-eyed pea soup, so we enjoyed the taste of this one with the good combination of all the flavors included in the soup. I just added 1 small chopped carrot to the onion, celery, green pepper and the 2 minced garlic cloves. I mixed all these ingredients with my hand blender, then added 4 cups of the cabbage and the blaked-eye peas at the end, and simmered for 15 minutes. Good recipe idea Chef, and good<br/>luck in the Dining on a Dollar Contest."
381180,512097,2014/3/3,4,"I added 1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten, and the bread had a tender inside crumb and a nice crust outside.  Next time I&#039;ll reduce the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon to allow more of the orange to shine through.  I really liked the chocolate and orange together.  I believe this would be equally good with finely chopped pecans instead of the wheat germ.  Tagged for Rookie Recipes; due 03/03/14 with extension."
239758,502781,2016/8/1,4,"A flavoursome dish and very easy to make. I made as written, except for cutting back a bit on the cayenne pepper to accommodate a guest who isn't fully into spice. My reason for four stars is that I'm not all that in to Bahamian-style food. Not sure why. Perhaps it's the addition of sugar because I like all the other flavours independently. Served with a Bahamian-style rice dish."

It tasted even better than I thought it would and it was easy to cut and serve, it didn't fall apart at all. Huge hit with my family. It's definitely going in the rotation. ?"

(None in the house, because I don&#039;t care for it). It was awesome, and such a great way to use up my head of broccoli that was wilting / browning.

447487,501853,2013/7/26,5,"I made two version of this lovely Bread Pudding. One as written and one for my dairy and gluten allergies. Both were absolutely delicious (yes, I ate the regular one, by accident, I paid but it was worth every bite! lol). Instead of brandy I used Triple Sec which I had on hand already. Hubby loved it too and said he could have eaten the whole pan. I always thought of bread pudding as slimy &amp; mushy, this was neither, I think whomever made it for me was &#039;doin&#039; it wrong&#039;. Thanks for a recipe I&#039;ll be making again and again, Jubes !&lt;br/&gt;Made during ZWT9, Bread N&#039;awlins Style Challenge for my team, Tasty Testers!"

2701435,494373,2013/2/19,4,I am not a big potato salad fan but this was very tasty.  It marries in the fridge and tastes even better days ahead.  Yummy
37449,497835,2013/4/28,0,"I did enjoy this dressing, but had to make some changes. I added more olive oil,as it was too tart for my taste and added some honey too. Had it with a nice green salad. Thanks!"
280271,497835,2013/5/4,4,This was very easy to throw together...I felt that the olive oil really stood out...I would use less of it next time...I served it over a nice tossed salad...thanks for posting it...=)
542159,497835,2013/5/4,4,"A true classic that allows you to get lots of flavor without over dressing your salad, found this to be a wonderful contrast to the very sweet little tomatoes in the salad. I cut the recipe down to quarter cup because it was just the two of us and made using white wine vinegar. Thanks for the post."
2002241402,522005,2018/8/7,5,Wow. This was SO easy and the ice cream is SO rich and smooth. I made vanilla but will use this base recipe for many flavors.

2001423584,529975,2017/3/8,5,"so glad I found this recipe. I make it once a week. I experiment with different flavors. I've added 3 Tablespoons of hemp hearts, 1 tablespoon of rosemary and 3 Tablespoons of parsesan cheese. They are good with everything. My guests love them. I started to freeze them as I can't eat them fast enough. With a little toasting they are as good as new. fabulous recipe"
2002343258,529975,2018/11/21,5,I am addicted to these crackers ! I do not bother with food processor at all and the recipe works fine. I use butter instead of coconut oil. I divide the dough in half and make 2 cookie sheets worth. I like them thin.
2002347264,529975,2018/11/25,5,Crunchy and satisfying! Next time I will use 2 baking sheets to roll them thinner.
2001276600,525187,2016/11/30,4,"Made this for Thanksgiving this year because I couldn't narrow down a choice for what to make, and piecaken didn't appeal much to me. I made a the recipe for the pecan pie and added 1C chocolate chips and 1/4 c of bourbon for a little added flavor. The buttercream in the yule log I added one 15 oz can of pumpkin and the typical pumpkin pie spices and it turned out a lot like a mousse which worked out well. The recipe for the chocolate cake came out really nice and I'll use it again. I'd probably say that the buttercream should be split into 3rds as the filling for the log definitely doesn't need 1/2 of the buttercream recipe, but that could also be in regards to how thick my cake was, I'd use a bigger pan next time. I ended up making another half batch (the first time I used meringue powder to sub half the whites because I had the left over from using just yolks elsewhere) and it made my buttercream really dark once refrigerated, the second time with only real whites came out much lighter regardless of using the same cocoa powder (dark chocolate) each time. A nice collaboration throughout!"
318262,518093,2014/9/6,4,Really loved the idea of the broccoli slaw in this. Will use it often now! The flavor of the sauce was a bit light for our tastes but with some extra tamari and chili sauce on each of our servings it was good!
1239906,499336,2013/4/25,5,I omitted the pico (personal preference) and played with the dip recipe a bit but overall it turned out to be a very yummy dish!  Thanks!
557649,520443,2015/1/9,5,I have made this before but I take the orange rind and dice it up fairly small and add it in.  Kind of like a marmalade!  The oil from the rind brings up the flavor a little.  But this is an excellent recipe!
37449,501153,2013/6/21,5,"I messed up the directions, I added a little extra sesame oi, thinking it was the soy sauce, but it was still delicious! Thanks!"
131126,501153,2013/6/22,5,"I appreciated the detailed instructions. Draining the tofu made a huge difference and is a technique I&#039;ll use in the future.  The flavors in the stir fry are nice.  Everything is well flavored, but not spicy &quot;hot&quot;.  I thought the flavors showcased the veggies and the dish is lovely.  Next time I might throw in some julienned red pepper, but otherwise I&#039;ll make it again as written.  Good luck in the contest!"
1803124398,518137,2014/9/11,5,"These came out great, we didn&#039;t have goat cheese so just used the cream cheese and though ours weren&#039;t as pretty as the picture the disappeared quickly"

It&#039;s a simple diet because most of what is needed in there are pretty basic like meats, fish, vegetables, and other simple things that you often find in the kitchen, that is why so many people are into it right now.

1186987,498985,2017/11/19,5,I was surprised how much I enjoyed this! Even my daughter loved it. I cooked it for 36 minutes and it was a little burnt. Next time I will check it right at 30 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

2001437671,526362,2017/3/15,5,Great recipe. So delicious &amp; easy
1925885,499500,2013/10/22,3,"Made these exactly as written, and served in a sauce of browned butter, maple syrup and cinnamon.  They were very pretty, though the gnocchi itself turned out gummy and dense, and seemed to be lacking something, not sure what. Perhaps a touch of honey, or another sweetener.  To be fair, the sweet potatoes here are not as flavorful as they are in the US, so that might have had something to do with it."
2000064757,499500,2015/3/15,0,Would be awesome to have the salt in the ingredient list if you are supposed to mix it in.  Couldn&#039;t someone proofread this before posting?  Salt is a pretty important ingredient and we shouldn&#039;t just guess....
2002137213,515804,2018/5/1,0,Is the broth all you eat for two weeks?
1206102,493854,2013/2/12,5,"This is a stunning recipe!  Every flavor melds beautifully, and is such a happy surprise in the mouth.  I put bits of this into small crisp-toasted won ton cups, topped with a cold peeled boiled shrimp, garnished with a cilantro leaf, and got raves!  (I like raves.)  Thanks, N2S, for a delightful new idea!"
1802587891,511988,2014/3/16,4,"I doubled the recipe &amp; added a tsp vanilla, I also used a little less than the 1/2 c honey. I used an unsweetened raw cacao powder. I mixed it all in the ninja blender. I was a thick fluffy batter. The first thing if noticed is how much they smell like regular cupcakes while baking. They did form to my silicone cupcake pan and rose just to the top of each muffin hole. At 20 mins, a toothpick came out clean &amp; they fell right out of the pan onto a cooling rack. The bottoms look a little dark so maybe less time on the next batch. I made 12 cupcakes and had a little batter left over. &lt;br/&gt;I cut one ope n, still steaming, and split it with my husband. We both agree that these are pretty darn good. They are less sweet than traditional cupcakes &amp; I have to iced them so maybe that will make a difference. But still quite yummy. They are a little grainy textured but fluffy and moist at the same time. I will definitely make these again. Happy birthday to my little guy!"
1803418135,511988,2015/6/12,4,No direction onhow much honey to add to the cupcakes or how much coconut oil to add for the frosting. Paleo baking seems to be an exact science and im a bit worried about ruining these for my son&#039;s birthday. Hopefully google will have a suggestion.

865936,515569,2014/5/22,5,"These are addictive.  Something about the contrast between the sweet green snaps, the bite from the wasabi, and the salt.  Really good."
226863,515569,2015/1/13,5,"I loved these!  I will even add a bit more wasabi powder next time.  My son said he didn&#039;t even taste the wasabi!  So quick and easy to make, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll make these often.  Thanks for sharing.....made for FYC game on Yuku."

1803488102,509352,2015/12/15,5,I made this soup for my picky boyfriend and he loved it! Myself and my mother also thought it was excellent. The only thing I will do next time is perhaps double the kale and add a bit more sweet potato. Otherwise it was delicious and extremely easy!
2734536,497376,2013/3/12,5,Good
1802793526,509352,2017/3/3,5,"This is the kind of recipe I'm drawn to---low in fat, high in fresh ingredients and a nice break from meats, for a change. DH, however, is not a fan of kale or lentils, but does eat them when served. I used the red lentils and I didn't soak them. They cooked right along w/ everything else just fine. To use up the little bit of baby kale left in the plastic box from the store, I was a tad over two cups of chopped kale. I also did a stalk more of celery and one more carrot. A funny thing, tho--- our two dogs know that when we're done eating, they get a thumbnail sized piece of the meat we're eating on top of their kibble. On this night, there was no meat in the room, but they sat as usual near the table waiting patiently. When I stood up, our little papillon startied in with the rapid fire barking he usually does being so excited about Something Extra time. I was surprised beings there was no meat smells going on. But, trusting that his nose was telling him something good was coming, I ladled out a bit in his bowl and he gunned it w/out stopping or looking up. The beagle had already eaten her kibble, but I put some soup in her bowl as well and she licked it clean and looked like she'd like to do that again, so I put a bit more in for a repeat performance. I imagine the same thing will happen when we have some as leftovers tonight. If there was anything I'd do differently, I might add some Great Northern beans to add a bit of protein. I would make this again."

582561,494831,2013/3/16,5,Fiddly little darlings to make but well worth the time involved.  Definitely spicy with great after taste.

2324285,500423,2014/2/17,5,"Really good.  My Polish parents used to make a similar potato dish, but theirs included kielbasa and did not include apples.  I have to say, this dish tastes way better.  The apples and the sauerkraut add a nice a tangy flavor to the potatoes, but it&#039;s not overwhelming.  The bacon and the green onions are the perfect garnish.  My potatoes took about 20 minutes longer to become tender, but it was worth the wait."

I used mrsteacher22&#039;s Recipe #290458 #290458 for plain mashed potatoes relying on good quality russets for taste and made this recipe a few days later.  With this recipe it is easy to control portions, and easy to prepare ahead, then pop in the oven without fuss.

128473,497518,2013/6/1,4,"Thank you for sharing this quick and easy to make dish Miss Fannie.  It reminds me of a dish my dad use to make.  Made exactly as written, next time, and there will be a next time,  I think I will omit the bread crumbs in the potato mixture, it made my potatoes a little tough and dry. It is a tasty option to regular mashed potatoes.  I enjoyed the flavor that the yogurt, green onions, garlic salt and white pepper brought to the dish."

143318,493602,2014/2/11,5,Genuine takeout flavor! Loved it.
1436160,493602,2014/3/12,5,"What a great recipe! I used dry sherry because that&#039;s what I had.  I used garlic chili sauce and it was not too spicy. If you want some heat, you should use more. I was debating whether to make more sauce, but decided to stick with the amounts given and I thought it was perfect. Since we were eating in shifts tonight, I added cashews after plating so they wouldn&#039;t get soggy. Thanks for sharing. Made for Best of 2013 tag."
482376,493602,2014/3/16,5,"Delicious! I think this is better than take-out. It&#039;s more of a natural flavor. The recipe is quick to prepare and very flavorful. I used Sriracha and the amount added just a hint of spice/heat, without being too much. I used Mirin (rice wine) and it was lovely with the other sauces. I served this over brown rice. This simple yet delicious dinner is going into my best-of-the-best file. Thank you!"

I did add a little more of everything except the salsa and they went home happy and with the recipe.

2324285,499409,2013/6/30,4,"Very good!  The flank steak was tender and juicy, and I really liked the addition of charred corn.  I don&#039;t much care for fajitas, so I made 6 mini burritos instead.  I also used pico de gallo instead of heirloom tomatoes.  I cooked everything on the stove and in the broiler because I don&#039;t have a grill, but it worked well for me.

2324285,515369,2014/5/7,4,"I love sriracha sauce, so I was excited to try this recipe.  This makes a very good roast chicken, but I could not taste the sriracha sauce much at all.  I tasted Dijon mustard more than anything.  Still, this is a perfectly fine roast chicken that was juicy and flavorful...  I just wish the smokey spiciness of the sriracha flavor came through more."
288719,526059,2017/1/28,5,"Light and fluffy, very flavorful-everything I want a pancake to be. I halved the recipe for me and hubby-and wish I hadn't! I could have devoured more! I can't wait to make these for the grandkids!"
296809,512594,2014/8/20,5,"Made as written for The Quest 2014 and served w/Mia&#039;s yummy meatballs. My DH loved this recipe as he is esp fond of my use of olives in recipes I make for him. I used a combo of both stuffed pimento green olives plus black olives &amp; I did not bother chopping them. I just sliced them quickly into thirds. I also did not bother chopping the capers. Mine were small &amp; I esp appreciated the burst of flavor from them. The garlic-infused breadcrumbs topper was the &quot;icing on the cake&quot;, so to speak. We liked this a lot Agent Sofie.

When I saw the calorie and saturated fat content, I almost had a heart attack.  But know that this is more than one serving.  I think it&#039;s more like four, since it&#039;s so rich.

67728,505837,2013/8/26,5,"This was a lovely ending to our recent Thai meal! The coconut sauce was perfect with the chopped mango. Like Jostlori mentioned, I don&#039;t think this is a single serving dessert.

2428393,508206,2015/1/8,4,"Yummy and simple! Definitely suits the tastes of a &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; guy like my husband. Would be delicious for breakfast too, maybe with some scrambled eggs.

625476,508206,2017/2/12,5,"Whenever I bake a ham, I make extra baked potatoes. Cold leftover (and peeled) baked potatoes make THE best fried potatoes whether in a lovely hash such as your recipe or on their own. Using them speeds up the cooking process. I love hash recipes and this one is nice and simple. Thank you !"
226867,507746,2013/11/2,5,"This was so tasty and easy to put together. I tweaked a little, too:  included the &quot;gravy&quot; with the can of chili beans. I figure since the recipe called for chili beans, not just black beans or pinto beans, I may as well use the gravy because it&#039;s got extra chili seasoning in it. Also, added chopped green pepper to the meat."
1802853672,507746,2014/6/24,5,Pleased my crowd. Will be making again. Just added some chopped jalapeno and the juice of the beans otherwise it was a little bland to our tastes but then we are all adults probably wouldn&#039;t have changed anything if we had small children. Reheats awesome too.
305531,507746,2014/10/5,5,"This was easy to make and very good. Like the others did, I added the juice from the beans for some extra seasoning. I made a smaller batch and we really enjoyed this. Thanks, NWG for a nice keeper that we will make again. Congrats on you Football win!!"
2000058318,507746,2015/3/12,5,Made this for the Single Marines in my husband&#039;s shop for their Meal in the Barracks and I&#039;m honestly jealous because it&#039;s so good and they get to eat it all. Haha. I saved a little for my small family of three to taste before sending the rest off to them. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be a big hit over there.
2000071946,507746,2015/3/19,5,"This was so yummy and easy. I made a few changes to suit everyone&#039;s taste. I used a jar (basically a cup and a half) of Trader Joe&#039;s Tomatillo &amp; Roasted  Yellow Chili salsa. This had just the right amount of smokey, spicy flavor for my family.  I used the chopped tomatoes, olives, and green onions as garnish instead of baking them into the casserole so that everyone could personalize their bowl. It came out perfect. I like this way better than regular chili. This is a keeper and so easy!"
140008,507746,2015/7/12,5,"I made this for a church group over the weekend and they devoured it!  I made a few changes.  I followed the original recipes by omitting the corn and increasing the chips to 3 cups.  Also, I omitted the olives as a personal preference.  I completed step 2 the day before.  I poured off the liquid on top of the chili beans, but did not drain them completely as I didn&#039;t want to lose all the seasoning.  The next day the filling was very thick like a chili and was very easy to spread in the pan.  I did use a 10 oz can if diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro for the tomato.  Again, I poured off the top liquid, but did not drain these well.  My baking dish was a foil 11.75x9.38-inch sterno pan.  This made the contents deeper, so since I was starting with a cold filling, I baked it for 45 minutes, put the cheese on and then another 15 minutes.  The food was hot, and the chips still had some crunch to them despite being on the bottom.  It was a great hit, thanks so much!"
2000936973,507746,2016/3/24,5,"Great dish! Made only a few changes. While I browned the meat, I added 1 tsp salt, and a half tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and chili powder. 
Also I used 3 cups of crushed chips, doubling the recipe amount.
With those changes I will def make this again and again."
2001844721,507746,2018/1/22,0,I just made it and it is delicious. I'm going to make one just like it to carry over for a sick friend who loves Mexican food. I used Rotel tomatoes instead of fresh ones.
2001789761,532787,2017/11/17,0,We're in the middle of making this recipe and it seems like it's missing some details. What is the marshmallow cream? It's not on the ingredient list?
280271,503127,2016/6/12,5,Made both sauces but on different days...I felt the cocktail sauce had a very tomato taste along with it being very sour from the lemon...so I added a touch of sugar and it was perfect...I cut both recipes in half...I made the tartar sauce to go with my tuna nuggets that I made...I didn't have sweet pickles so I just used relish...both of these will be made again...made for &quot;First Time&quot; tag game...
480195,503954,2013/7/24,4,These were good but I feel they needed to be peeled after cooking and some additional seasoning was required. I added 1 tsp of Greek all purpose seasoning.
855082,505945,2013/11/21,5,"Made this slaw, as recipe is written,  the night before I grilled some asparagus and chuck steaks on the Weber. &lt;br/&gt;As I get older, I like bolder flavors.  However, I used half of a small Jalapeno because my wife has more sensitive palate than I. We both enjoyed this slaw, so I thank you for this flavorful recipe, gailanng."
2000839994,525493,2016/1/26,3,"This was easy to make, but the marinade didn&#039;t do much for the chicken. The flavor was more noticeable on the broccoli."
2641763,525493,2017/1/7,2,"It was edible by my standards, but not my kids'. Not enough sauce, broccoli needs more oil/sauce to not char. Potatoes were bland."
316194,495014,2013/4/4,4,Very Good dip. We enjoyed it with tortilla chips but I think that pita bread or pita chips would be an even nicer accompaniment. Next time I think I&#039;ll add sliced black olives and a dash of lemon juice. Thank you. Posted for 2013 Spring Pic-A-Chef.
1359842,494560,2013/2/4,5,Awesome!
2201427,494560,2013/2/4,5,Great recipe!!  These biscuits would be a hit with my family!!!
2204786,494560,2013/2/4,5,Pass me a plate full!! Yummmmers!
865936,516284,2014/7/24,5,"This was just what I expected, easy and healthy. I love the steaming of the quinoa. I never thought of that before."
2001632601,531381,2017/7/18,0,"well that does sound easy, almost like cake! might have to try it though, I'll get back to you."
2662969,494560,2013/2/1,5,"Biscuits with a new twist, I will try these!"
306726,494560,2013/2/1,5,Unusually delicious biscuits!!!!!! I bet they are mighty tasty!
144373,503621,2013/8/11,5,"Delicious, Nice and Chocolatey, easy to make. Family enjoyed it. Made as written.  For ZWT9 ~ The Apron String Travelers"
621329,498672,2014/4/19,5,"Great recipe... my husband loves these, kills his craving for breads on phase 1!!  I did use ricotta as he doesn&#039;t like the consistency/texture of cottage cheese and added an extra splash of vanilla.... very tasty!!"
1803553380,498672,2016/7/25,5,I've made this recipe many times: exactly as written (I use 1/3 cup Splenda) and I've made small adjustments to make these perfect for me. Any way you make these they have the best texture for the south beach diet. The muffins come out fluffy and light like a cupcake. I top mine with sugar free cool whip! Adjustment 1: I prefer ricotta cheese over cottage cheese. The texture doesn't change much and using the cottage cheese isn't bad at all (the curds melt and disappear). However the cottage cheese makes the muffins stick to the pan or muffin papers and the ricotta cheese doesn't stick at all. The cottage cheese also gives an interesting taste I can't explain. It's not bad using cottage cheese but for me ricotta is better. Adjustment 2: The baking soda is way too overpowering and comes out super bitter. I now make these using 1/2 tsp baking soda &amp; 1/2 tsp baking powder. The bitter taste is very minimal if not completely gone. Seriously this recipe is the best and I make these all the time!!
2001500017,498672,2017/4/21,4,
1802952946,502861,2014/7/21,5,"This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  When I baked it I didn&#039;t use very much taco seasoning, and I used flour tortillas which I baked over the oven rack after spraying Pam on them.  Excellent recipe!"
2173462,502861,2014/10/11,5,"Of course, I didn&#039;t have the refrained beans or soft tortillas, but I did have premium canned chili, crunchy shells and those newer soft taco &quot;boats&quot;, as I call them. Added some chili to some taco filling I already had, stuffed the various tacos, topped with whatever shredded cheese I had and baked until cheese was nicely melted. I liked the crunchy shells better, but the boats were perfectly acceptable and way easier to eat once topped with all the wonderful stuff I put on them. Maybe I&#039;ll precook the taco boats a little before I use them in this recipe again, just to firm them up a bit. Great dish, serve with some spanish rice and a little salad."
1803261045,502861,2014/10/24,4,"I followed the recipe with only one change, used two 16 oz cans of refried beans, and it made 20 tacos.  Family loved it, will definitely be making again!"
829250,502861,2014/12/28,5,"Finally a taco my daughter will eat. I usually use corn shells and fry them and she don&#039;t like them. My husband said twice how good they were. I liked them but I am thinking next time I will use shredded beef. I topped with lettuce, tomatoes, homemade salsa, and sour cream."
2000327907,502861,2015/7/9,4,"These were good.  Made them with veggie meat substitute, canned black beans, and my own seasonings.  Very easy.  Will definitely make these again."
2000376202,502861,2015/8/1,5,"SO  amazing.  I used ground turkey and diced in some jalape&ntilde;os.  Definitely going to make these again, I love tacos"
625476,502861,2015/8/18,5,I thought these were awesome.  I used the flat bottomed taco shells.   I don&#039;t understand how someone can give it less than five stars when they didn&#039;t follow the recipe exactly.   It skewers the overall rating of the recipe.
2001163936,502861,2016/9/11,5,"Loved this recipe so much! Added my own favorites, and tried a few different ways. This has turned out to be my go to way to cook tacos now."
2001178056,502861,2016/9/21,5,"Great recipe! I use Ortega smoked chipotle taco sauce in lieu of the tomato sauce. I also use an entire package of Ortega taco seasoning to the refried beans and meat mixture. You can add as much taco sauce as you like, to your desired taste. Thank you for a great recipe!"
2001301310,502861,2016/12/16,0,15 minutes is the perfect baking time for the shells. After reading all the reviews the one thing that I added and no one seems to have mentioned was the GUACOMOLE!!
2001473161,502861,2017/4/5,5,"Love this recipe. Kept ingredients the same, but instead of mixing the beans in with the meat, I spread them on the Tortillas. Easy and tasty recipe, and so many ways to make it to your liking."
2001419290,502861,2017/9/5,5,These oven baked tacos we're a bit hit at my house. My family loved them. I'm using this recipe many times again
2001624817,502861,2017/10/27,4,Great recipe!!! Whole family loved!!This will be added to meal rotation.
2001826715,502861,2017/11/26,5,I’ve made this recipe many times before. It’s one of my family’s favorites. So delicious!
2002184418,502861,2018/6/13,5,Easy meal and my whole family loved it!
2002235355,502861,2018/7/31,5,I thought everyone was exaggerating when they said how good this was. This. Recipe. Is. Amazing.
2002271887,502861,2018/9/10,5,"Whole family loved these! Great for feeding a crowd...although, I wouldnt consider the serving size be 1 taco. Probably 2 tacos for me, and possibly 3 for kids/husband."
2002277244,502861,2018/9/17,5,A big hit for a Packer party everyone said they were delicious!
1925885,504914,2013/8/1,5,"Oh, this is a keeper!!!  Made this exactly as written, but forgot to take the picture.  So of course, had to make a second one!  LOL... On the second one, I used orange bitters because I love Fee Brothers - and that was really, really good too.  Thanks for posting what will likely become one of my go-to cocktails.  Very tropical!!!"
383346,504914,2013/8/5,5,I used passion fruit juice.  I think the angostura bitters added a nice touch to the drink.  It&#039;s very yummy and tropical.  Thanks NorthwestGal :)  Made for ZWT9
539686,504914,2013/8/6,5,I used the juice and this is very tasty! Made for ZWT #9
599450,504914,2013/8/7,5,"Delicious, NorthwestGal! After this drink I slathered on the suntan lotion and headed for the beach! I&#039;ll have another when I return! Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
2001621720,504914,2017/7/11,5,Wife and I went to Barbados on our honeymoon....this brings us back..... Its awesome!!!
1745502,502694,2013/8/5,5,"No callaloo to be had, Surprise! So I used mixed greens instead. What I liked about this recipe was the grated carrots. I tend to avoid putting in carrots, as they create too much chunky sweetness. When grated it looks pretty, but melds in nicely. Thyme is a nice touch too."
865936,502694,2016/8/2,5,Mmmm. This is a very good way to cook greens of any type. I loved all the flavors. It was also very good re-heated the next day.
1925885,502694,2016/8/8,5,"Outstanding! I love greens of any kind, but until moving to Florida, hadn't seen Callaloo in any grocery stores. Lucky me, I found canned Callaloo in Publix, and this recipe fit the bill! I imagine you could use any greens, but I don't think there's a substitute for the real thing. I really enjoyed this; it took me back to the Caribbean! Made for CQ 2016, team Pi Rho Maniacs."
9523987,526913,2017/6/14,5,"A wonderful summer salad! I went light on the dressing initially, about 1/3--but added more the next day (I think the quinoa soaked it up?) The combination of ingredients is DELICIOUS, fresh and light. The feta gave a wonderful salty note! It was loved by all kids to adults. I used a combo of basil, parsley and chives. Perfect!"
179133,494439,2013/4/27,5,These are awesome! I was really surprised how much I enjoyed these in comparison to potato fries. I halved the recipe and definitely did use the cayenne. Baked on parchment for ease of turning and clean up. Wasn&#039;t sure what to serve with but turned out plain old ketchup was pretty yummy to dip them in! Thanks for sharing! [Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef]
128473,494439,2014/3/12,5,"Thank you so much for sharing this recipe KUW.  I have made them twice  already.   I love plantains and this is a wonderful way to showcase them.  They were wonderful.  Tasted just like french fries, but you could definitely taste the plantain. They were so easy to make. I did prefer the ones that I cut thicker into wedges, rather than the shoestring size, they were crispy yet tender. Such a lovely spicy flavor, I did use the optional cayenne pepper and then garnished with sea salt, fresh ground pepper and ketchup.   Made for Best of 2013."
2000122796,494439,2015/4/6,5,"Juicy, scrumptious and healthy! wow! im still baffeled by the fact that I  haven&#039;t tried plantain like this, an alternative to frying and an ultimate alternative to French fries.
With a combination of sweet potato fries, this was just heavenly.

Tip- When you have very ripe plaintain, it won&#039;t require much seasoning, just a bit of salt would do."
526411,511977,2014/1/19,4,My husband and I both liked this quick and easy recipe.  I liked the marshmallow topping. It added sweetness without being too sweet.  I made this for &quot;New Kids on the Block&quot; recipe tag.
1287956,494075,2013/1/31,4,"I liked this but would probably use carnitas or asada as my meat, since those are less greasy.  I also used cilantro-lime salad dressing on the side for the cabbage slaw, and it added some flavor to this."
2001815688,517161,2017/11/22,0,LOOKS AND SOUNDS GREAT BUT FEEL THE NAME SHOULD BE CHANGED ALSO. VERY HURTFUL.
2794173,499006,2013/5/21,5,"Made these for an International Evening at our school in the UK, they went down a treat!"
2597942,505947,2013/10/18,5,"Very, very easy and tasty side dish to make. The best part was that I had everything on hand. It couldn&#039;t be any simpler to make with those few ingredients. It was a nice side our our pork tenderloin the other night. I can&#039;t think of anything I would change on this (except maybe a dash of pepper for good measure). Thank you for posting your recipe. It is saved. (Made for PRMR)"
285039,505947,2014/2/24,5,"This was a delicious side dish for the grilled steak I had for dinner today.  I steamed the zucchini instead of par boiling it, and used low fat sour cream instead of full fat.  Got great reviews from the vege eaters in my family!"
266635,505947,2015/1/25,5,"We absolutely love zucchini and this dish was so delicious.  I decided to steam the zucchini, but otherwise made as directed.  Will definitely make this dish again.  Made for the For Your Consideration tag game."
227978,505947,2017/1/30,5,"This was really easy to make and is pretty quick, too. And it's so good. I'll make this often!! Thanks, breezermom. We all enjoyed this very much."
482376,503688,2013/9/4,5,"This is a winner! Into my best file it goes. It&#039;s absolutely delicious!!! I used Vegenaise instead of the mayo, which worked fine. I added just a bit of water at the end to make it a little thiner. Great flavor! Made for Family Picks - Soup-A-Stars ZWT9"
266635,503688,2013/9/10,5,"Love this salad dressing, it is so creamy and flavorful.  We absolutely love feta so this dressing will be my new go-to recipe.  I love oil and vinegar dressings, but I really don&#039;t have a good creamy dressing like this.  Made for PRMR, September, 2013."
1800056768,503688,2013/9/12,5,"Incredibly delicious !!! I am so glad I tried this one first. incredibly creamy and such bold flavor, I doubled the recipe and I am so glad I did . so worth making this . I have sent this to all my friends to make . my Favorite by far ."
386585,503688,2013/9/24,5,"This was so delicious, and so easy to make!  I used romaine and rainbow cherry tomatoes from the garden in the salad (with a few kalamata olives thrown in), and the dressing complemented them perfectly!  It makes a lot of dressing, which was fine with me, because now I have it to look forward to again!"
285039,503688,2013/10/3,5,"This was absolutely delicious, and a nice alternative to more basic Greek Dressing.  In trying to reduce calories, I used an olive oil based mayo and lite sour cream.  I used fresh oregano from the garden, and place it on top of classic Greek salad fixings ... minus the red onion because doesn&#039;t like me!"
226863,503688,2013/11/5,5,This is delicious!  I saw a review for it during ZWT and put it in my &quot;Want to Try&quot; cookbook immediately.  A delicious change from the normal olive oil based Greek dressings. Thanks so much for this delicious recipe!
37449,503688,2014/2/14,5,"This was great over lettuce, carrots, and celery. Thanks! Made for the PRMR game."
498271,503688,2014/2/18,5,"What a terrific salad dressing!  So creamy and loved the flavor of the vinegar, dijon and feta.  I used reduced-calorie sour cream, mayo, and feta with excellent results.  Great on a salad and I&#039;m sure it would be a great veggie dip too.  Thanks for sharing a keeper!  Made for the Best of 2013 event, recommended by LifeIsGood"
1802636596,515164,2014/4/2,5,spicy and good
136997,494856,2013/5/15,5,Delicious way to serve green beans. I will reduce the amount of sesame seeds by 1 tbsp. next time though. :)
39835,505036,2014/1/7,4,Very good and interesting! I did wonder about this recipe (skipped the frosting) but made the brownies as directed and served them to a group of people who really enjoyed the brownies (and no one thought I used avocado in them!) A great way to use up avocados! Thanks for sharing!
653438,497588,2013/3/23,5,This was a very tasty dish!  I followed the recipe as written only adding two small cloves of garlic.  Made for Spring PAC 2013 and will be making it again.  DH and I do have plenty for leftovers even after cutting the recipe down.  Thank you for posting.
237297,497588,2013/12/9,1,"I love every PW recipe I&#039;ve ever made. This was horrible!  After baking for 1 hr and 10 mins, it was still very soupy.  I gave it another 15 minutes, it was a little thicker but still way too much liquid.  I gave it a taste and it was disgusting!! It tasted like milky flour.  I didn&#039;t like the idea of just whisking the flour in the cream mixture without cooking it like a roux, but I gave it a try.   I went over the recipe again to be sure I didn&#039;t leave out a step or ingredient and I didn&#039;t.  I just happened to catch an episode where PW make this without the ham and it was thin and soupy when she dished hers out as well.  Not what I would think of as scalloped.  But the taste was worse than the texture. I feel badly giving this such a low rating since it&#039;s PW&#039;s recipe, not Johnsdeere&#039;s, but I would hate to anyone else to waste so much time and money on this."
1056692,497588,2016/2/20,5,"I loved this recipe.  I had it saved somewhere else, and I&#039;m glad to find it here so I don&#039;t lose it again.  Made this exactly to the recipe, and I was totally worried it wasn&#039;t going to set up, but the sauce thickened beautifully.  My first time making scalloped potatoes, and I love that you don&#039;t have to cook and stir a roux on the stove.  Going to add some garlic to the ham and onion mixture next time, because that does sound yummy.  I used my Cuisinart to get the potatoes a uniform slice, and they were perfectly cooked in the time stated in this recipe."
1803684521,504969,2016/4/24,5,"Delicious! This was my first time making dough and it turned out pretty good I think. I had to be careful though, as my first batch were almost burnt after 9 minutes! The second batch I lowered the temp and had to remove them at 8 minutes as they were getting really dark. Once I figure out the time/temp they&#039;ll be perfect! Overall this recipe was great, and easy to follow! Thank you!"
1802849661,504969,2016/7/15,4,"I've never made oven donuts like this before! They turned out great, but I would add a little more cinnamon for my personal tastes. Having a doughnut cutter made making these a cinch as well; really fab way to enjoy doughnuts without the guilt of all that frying!"
1436160,519282,2014/12/25,5,This recipe made a delicious Christmas Eve dinner! I used 1 1/2 lbs of salmon and doubled the amounts for the mayonnaise/mustard mixture.  I used double the amount of breadcrumbs with 1 Tbsp of olive oil.  Next time I would use less mayonnaise/mustard mixture.  There will definitely be a next time. Thanks for sharing!
1783552,519282,2015/12/31,5,"This is one of my favorite salmon recipes!  I love the Dijon mustard myself, but for my family I go lighter with just a little bit of regular mustard."
169430,506648,2017/2/20,5,"Oh my gosh, did I have a good dinner last night. I made your tagine (really enjoyed using my tagine again!). Aside from making a half amount I just went by the recipe and wouldn't change a single thing. I paired it with a Mediterranean tuna salad and Turkish coffee made in the ibrik and was in heaven. I think I need a wall mural of Marrakesh! :D"
2000162008,499300,2015/4/24,4,"Good recipe. 1st time I made it I thought it was too sweet, so 2nd time around, I omitted all the sugar in the dough, except for about 1 tablespoon in the yeast so it could rise. The store bought poppy filling is so sweet, that all this extra sugar is not necessary. Overall I liked it"
2549237,513534,2014/5/6,5,Very easy and super quick.  It was really great for a weeknight when the kiddos has baseball practice and then a game.  I served this with carrots and celery sticks with ranch dressing and potato chips and it was a well enjoyed meal.  Thank you for a great meal on a hectic night ForeverMama!  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
226863,507136,2013/10/14,5,"Great beans!  I love black beans, and these were spectacular.  I let them cook longer than indicated, but I like mine really soft.  Served with cilantro rice and amberjack with tarragon-lemon breadcrumbs.  Great meal!! Thanks for sharing! Made for PRMR tag game."
527607,507136,2014/8/26,5,Easy and flavorful meal.  I cooked them until soft and served them with rice.
37636,513984,2014/11/24,5,"At first when I made these I was a bit disappointed that they were a bit oily after preparing them, but after sitting for a few days the oil has been absorbed into the nuts and they are much better.&lt;br/&gt;The spicing on these is delicious and excellent and makes a very nice batch of spicy peanuts---just make them a few days ahead of time for best results."
2180507,524744,2015/11/24,5,"Zac, I cannot WAIT to make this recipe - especially after seeing Kelli Ripa rave about it.  On the Apple Upside-down Cake recipe, it staes &quot;1 large Granny Smith apples&quot;.  Is this a type-o?  Only one apple for the recipe?  I wonder if it should be 11?  Just curious.  I hope you receive this comment and respond.  I can&#039;t wait to make it.  Coming to NYC for Christmas next month, and we will definitely dine at your establishment.  Happy Holidays!"
2000722608,524744,2015/12/1,5,This is a great recipe! The cake has great flavor and was a big hit this year at thanksgiving! Everyone was confused at first and curious to try it. The whole cake was gone and many went back for seconds.
42378007,524744,2016/7/22,5,So great!! The ultimate crowd pleaser.
2001258819,524744,2016/11/21,0,"Basically the only thing new here is the &quot;how&quot; because the dessert was created and introduced by a character on Drop Dead Diva, only she called it a &quot;Pake&quot;. It never showed how she made it or gave instructions but she opened a shop to sell them and then sold the idea and made a mint. There's just a bit too much dryness for me, with the sponge and the crust. Maybe I'm just not doing it right."
2001260735,524744,2016/11/22,0,I got the part where you remove the parchment. Where is the part where you add it? I'm guessing that is how you prepare the cake pan? Looking forward to trying this tbh fam.
2001269802,524744,2016/11/25,3,"I'll just say I was pretty disappointed with this cake. I would never use this frosting again. It is like that whipped crap on Costco cakes. Some people like that I do not. Additionally, pecan pie at the bottom isn't the best either. As time went on it kept seeping out. I would also add more and ticket cut apples to the top. Overall, it was just ok. Definitely not amazing as the reviews indicate. I will be trying another recipe for piecaken."
1052065,524744,2017/11/18,5,I made this last year and plan to make it again this year for Thanksgiving. It is a fun new tradition and delicious!
2001821545,524744,2017/11/23,0,frosting is too salty and too buttery. Not sure the frosting recipe is correct.

The only one who didn&#039;t eat it was allergic to sunflower seeds.   Ended up making 8 loaves in 5 days!  Suggest getting enough ingredients for 4 loaves at a time and putting the dry ingredients in the correct proportions in plastic bags, so it doesn&#039;t take so much time to make the next time."

2001498280,512881,2017/5/9,5,Add dried fruit and protein powder to improve it even further.
2585084,500447,2013/5/26,4,"I thought the potatoes and beans would be mushy-wow, was I wrong. The beans were tender, crisp and the potatoes were melt in your mouth tender.  I enjoyed the sauce on the potatoes, but would have liked the beans better without the sauce."
2000001843,516746,2015/2/17,3,"I made this today and thought it turned out quite well, particularly for a neophyte like me. Next time around, I&#039;ll probably cut down the amount of water and maybe throw in an extra can of tomato paste to get a thicker consistency."
80353,503989,2013/8/28,4,"I didn&#039;t deep-fry these, but just added a bit of (olive) oil to a large skillet and swooshed them around in there with a spatula until brown and crispy.  I think an element of sweet (a dusting of brown sugar?) would be nice here, as well."
133174,509520,2014/2/22,4,Very tasty dish.  DH really enjoyed it but I think I would have liked a little heat to it.  I used basmati brown rice.  I think the recipe should say that 2 cups cooked rice is needed.  Not having the tomato passata 1 cup of canned tomatoes was pureed and used.  The almonds were lightly toasted before garnishing.  Made for Aussie Swap.
494867,503797,2013/9/29,5,"I really liked how these turned out!  I used a sweet Thai chili sauce and loved how the baked tofu was sort of crisp and chewy and sweet and spicy all at the same time.  I also loved how easy this was to do, will be making this often!"
37449,503797,2013/9/30,5,I used a homemade curry sauce/paste that was hot but very good. It turned out great! I did scale the recipe way down just for me. Thanks!
128473,516278,2014/8/6,5,"Wow, Marra, are these ever good.  I&#039;m eating them as I type this.  So much flavor, soft, tender, crisp, spicy, sweet and delicious.  They have incredible flavor and texture from the sweet onion, corn, hot pepper and cheese.  Be patient and gentle when turning these beautiful corn cakes, they are worth the wait and they will firm up.  Thank you so much for sharing this lovely recipe. I served dh&#039;s with recipe #404355 he raved about them so much that I added the butter to mine as well. Yes, I enjoyed a slice of onion with this.... I separated the onion slice into rings and added to the top of my pancake drizzling maple syrup over everything.  So good.  Made for Culinary Quest Southern - Tribute to the Onion.  I can&#039;t wait to make these again.  Highly recommend them.."
128541,493163,2013/4/22,4,"The custard was delicious and rich, not too sweet.  The sugar I put on top was the perfect compliment.  My only complaint is that the recipe doesn&#039;t work as written.  I had to bump the crock pot up to high for another hour, like you, Boomette.  Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t read the description and didn&#039;t plan adequately for this to be ready for dessert.  Perhaps you are able to edit the recipe for the next person?  Thanks for the delicious recipe!"

266635,509878,2013/12/18,4,"This dish is a nice take on chili and is just spicy enough for our tastes.   It&#039;s a tasty way to serve up egg noodles and It reminds me of a dish my Mom used to make when we were kids, but it had alot more green bell pepper and chili powder and was served over rice.  Served this dish with a side salad -- it made a really nice comfort meal.  Made for PRMR, December, 2013."
47892,503549,2013/7/21,5,"Five gold stars +++++!!! This was Heaven on a plate! I used a slightly small baking pan about 9x10 (which was buttered). One half cup of safflower oil was replaced with olive oil,I used Oregon&#039;s own Nancy&#039;s whole milk yogurt local eggs and local clover honey. I added about 1 tablespoon freshly grated orange zest and freshly grated nutmeg. The honey syrup portion was cut in half and to make soaking easier I made small holes in the top of the cake using a toothpick. Watching that syrup soak in to the still hot cake was a culinary experience beyond description. I had to reduce the heat for the syrup and be sure to use the smallest burner on the stove top or else you&#039;ll burn the sugar and honey. Made for ZWT 9."
204024,503549,2013/7/22,5,This cake has a wonderful flavor.  I made this cake for the Vegan Challenge for ZWT9.  In doing so I had to use a substitution for the eggs.  I used 1/3 C applesauce for each egg.  The cake turned out pretty heavy but tasty. Made for ZWT9.
163112,503549,2013/7/25,4,"I feel terrible that I&#039;m not totally overjoyed.  :(  We love spice cake &amp; cakes with syrup poured over them but ...  in my opinion, there is way too much sugar here.  My cake FLOATED when I added the syrup. :o  I would halve the syrup recipe, leave out the sugar &amp; just use 1c honey &amp; 1c water.  I would double the spices in the cake.  But that&#039;s us.  It&#039;s LOVELY the way it is, we just thought it could use a bit more.  Thank you, Mikekey!  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers.  :)  GO TEAM!"

128473,509646,2013/11/24,5,"Wow, girl!  Wish I could give you more than 5*&#039; stars, 10  stars seems more appropriate.  What a great recipe.  Quick, and easy to make, with ingredients found in most pantries and fridges, but best of all it was big, big, big on flavor.  Great texture with a fantastic flavor.  We really enjoyed the way you could taste all the ingredients.  The lime, salt, mayo and cilantro complitment each other beautifully.  It was even better the following day. I have made this mayonaise recipe twice this week.  I used it on a simple fried egg on a brioche bun and also a tomato sandwich served on naan bread.  The mayo took both sandwiches somewhere special.  I can&#039;t wait to try it with fresh crisp vegetables.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe that I will be enjoying for years to come."
204024,509646,2014/2/16,5,This was made and immediately enjoyed with broccoli.   Made for Favorites of 2013 game.

2739309,495604,2013/3/23,4,This sounds good. I&#039;m going to make it for my neighbor who is from New Orleans. I gave 4 stars because there is no picture.
280271,495606,2013/3/18,5,These are yummy...I was going to serve them with a salad...but hubby up and ate all but one...that one I got...he agrees with the chef that these would be very tasty served warm over vanilla ice cream...I cooked mine in the toaster oven for 20 minutes and still they really didn&#039;t get brown...next time I will try the broiler in the oven...thanks for posting this tasty little dish...made for Spring PAC 2013 =)

2001747588,525788,2017/10/10,5,Fabulous paratha and simple to make. I added roasted cumin seeds and chopped spring onions to my potatoes - really tasty
542159,495606,2013/3/30,4,Fallowed the advice of another reviewer and served these tasty slices over ice cream which made for one tasty lunch (yes we were bad and had ice cream for lunch). Baked mine under the oven broiler and they did get a nice light golden color. Thanks for the post.
29196,495608,2013/3/20,5,"I used half the chilli powder, no salt (lots in there with the fish sauce) and added a cup or so of sprouts and some capsicum into the salad. I was worried the dressing might be too tangy and need more sugar than stated, but it was perfect and the star of this super quick dinner. Maybe the best way I&#039;ve ever found to use a chook I bought cooked from the supermarket. Thanks for posting Tis."
226867,517885,2018/7/29,5,"Extra stars should be available! This was so good! The lime zest was really evident and made the cornbread extra sweet.

Made for SWT2018"
227978,517885,2018/8/10,5,"This was a great cornbread recipe, momaphet. I loved the touch of lime, it was so good. It was really easy to make, too. I used an 8-inch square baking dish, and it worked out just fine. I didn't go for the option of adding chipotle, only because I didn't have any on hand. But it was still a great cornbread recipe."
386585,503341,2013/7/14,5,"What a yummy meat loaf!  I made this exactly as posted, using a white whole-grain bread for the breadcrumbs.  I did end  up using Vidalia onion and 90% lean beef, but I don&#039;t think it made any difference.  It is such a great combination of flavors.  The glaze is lovely, although you probably don&#039;t need to use all of it, but I did.  This cooked for 1 hour total and was perfect.  We are not the biggest meat loaf fans, but this raises meat loaf to another level.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
340141,503341,2013/9/2,4,"DH gave this ten stars; it was a three star for me.   It just reflects our feelings toward meatloaf.   I didn&#039;t have a full pound of ground andouille....I think I would have enjoyed it alot more with that, but I was afraid it would make it too hot for him.   I do love the large size of this loaf.   That&#039;s alot of meatloaf dinners made for him in one stroke!   ZWT9"
128473,494411,2013/2/12,5,"Yum, yum, yum, one for each component of this tasty drink.  Really worth the extra effort.  All three items together create a memorable drink.  So much flavor, I really enjoyed this tasty treat.  The Syrup was fragrant and sweet, the raw sugar was the bomb, I love the consistency of it, like flavored icing sugar, so good and the latte was devine.  A perfect rememdy for my poor headache.  Thanks so much for sharing another winner, my friend,  I'll be making this all week."
498271,494411,2013/5/20,5,"Mmmmmmmmm....that&#039;s all that needs to be said!  Loved all the rich vanilla flavor.  Fantastic with coffee, also great with a strong chai tea - Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
157425,522868,2016/7/23,5,"My hubby loves chicken wings so wanted him to give these a try. We marinated the wings for about 6 hours and turned them every hour or so. He grilled the wings on his gas grill and we had a wonderful supper. The chicken was moist, the sauce was a little sweet/salty and clung to the wings which we really liked. The only thing my hubby said was a little less ginger next time. We will make these again! Stacy G thanks for sharing! Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest 2016 - Japanese Required."
461834,522868,2016/7/23,5,"I made these wonderful wings for lunch today, along with some Japanese cucumbers. I only made 1/2 of the recipe and left the tips on, as I find that they make for a great way to get the wings a nice char, but keep it off of the grill (directly) and prevent over cooking (burning). Love trying wings that aren't Buffalo wings, so thanks for posting a great alternative!!"

163112,502824,2013/7/16,5,"Fairly quick &amp; very easy.  I lined my baking sheet with super large extra heavy duty foil, &amp; toasted the pecans in the preheating oven.  I removed them to a bowl, put the rack onto the pan &amp; loaded up the bacon!  the cooking times are spot on.  I do recommend removing the final result from the rack before they cool, harden &amp; adhere!  I have a VERY happy tummy!!  Thank you!  Made for ZWT9 Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
47892,502824,2013/7/16,5,Wow! I also lined the pan with foil (this is a very messy recipe!) and I made my own simple syrup: Recipe #26987 and added about 1/2 teaspoon of pure maple extract. In our new oven I cooked the bacon (*local* bacon) for only 12 minutes and after adding the topping just another 2-3 minutes. This was good all on its own but will taste amazing tomorrow on a tossed salad as garnish. I imagine this tasting extra decadent crumbled on top of a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream. Made for ZWT 9.
80353,502824,2013/7/18,5,"Like I really needed to see this recipe!  I scaled down to 1 serving because I recognized the evil intent behind it, which was a good thing because my son and I ate all 6 rashers in, maybe, 2 minutes?  Unbelievably good.  Unbelievably messy.  I took aforementioned advice and lined my pan with aluminum foil so that there wouldn&#039;t be any clean-up."
37449,502824,2013/7/18,5,Oh my! I used veggie bacon and this was the bomb! I used three pieces of Morningstar bacon and ate them all in about 2 seconds. YUM! Made for ZWT by team Hot Stuff!
128473,502824,2013/7/21,5,"Delicious simply delicious.  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Quick and oh so easy to make, this could be trouble.  The bacon was lovely, chewy, smokey, sweet and nutty.  Truly a very special treat.  I served it for breakfast with orange slices and recipe #502796 and for lunch I added it to recipe #480215 truly memorable.  Thank you for sharing. Made for ZWT9 - Hot Pink Panthers on the Prowl."
526666,502824,2013/7/22,5,"LOVED IT! LOL - I&#039;m such a sweets fiend, this is perfect for me, sorta jump-start for my day! I used a maple flavored bacon, which I feel may have made it just a little bit better, if that&#039;s possible! I followed directions and am so glad I did - I used a silicone mat under the bacon while cooking, to ease clean up and when removing from the pan, placed on another mat, to prevent sticking. (I had 2 pieces leftover, which I&#039;ve hidden away while trying to decide what to make with them - maple praline bacon ice cream? Perhaps!) LOL Thanks for sharing this decadent recipe, Annacia!"
285039,494399,2013/7/27,5,"My daughter; the baker in my house made these last night and we found them to be absolutely delicious!  She used dark chocolate chips, which together with the oats make for a semi-healthy treat!  She used the large Pampered Chef cookie scoop, and baked the cookie for 17 minutes to perfection.  We will definitely make these again!"
323186,502824,2013/7/22,5,"Omg, this is 10 star, and I rarely say that!    This was just amazing and if DD had been here I would have had to make 3 times as much because she would have eaten the first batch before I could turn around!     Absolutely fab and ssooo easy!

1060667,502824,2016/2/17,5,"SO DELISH!!!  My only little critique would be the directions say to bake the bacon and then mix the next 3 ingredients, which I did, then it says to brush the bacon with the syrup and sprinkle the pecan mixture on.  Still worked out the way I did it, but that should be cleared up as some people may get confused and start all the way over using new ingredients.  Anyway turned out good anyway, just fix those directions :)"
2123645,502824,2017/8/15,5,"So amazing! I couldn't find cane syrup, so I used light corn syrup instead and it worked fine. I would suggest spraying the rack with cooking spray because I found that the bacon stuck a little."
2000844812,525769,2016/1/29,5,Awesome taste
2000853836,525769,2016/2/11,1,"Taste good although seems like somthing is missing,as mine came out flat nothing like the picture."
2000751604,503119,2017/9/5,3,I made this yesterday. It was just ok. It wasn't very flavorful. I ended up brushing the tops with salted butter and then some agave syrup. The taste was much better after that.
285039,496739,2013/4/30,5,"Delicious alternative to a plain old Sloppy Joe.  I didn&#039;t make it home at lunch to start these and get them in a crock pot, so I followed the recipe with the exception of cooking them stove top on low for about an hour.    I used shredded mozzarella in place of the provolone, and homemade marinara instead of crushed tomatoes because it is what I had on hand.  I would definitely make these again ... it would be a great dish to serve at an informal gathering!"
128473,502286,2014/1/19,5,"Wow, I really enjoyed this delicious coffee Sharon.  It was really fragrant and flavorful.  I loved that you could taste both the cinnamon and the cardamom in the coffee. I aerated the coffee mixture about 15 times, was perfect for me.  Thank you so much for sharing another wonderful coffee recipe.  Made for Name that Ingredient."
1783373,502286,2014/6/1,5,"This coffee is really different, but good!  I aerated mine about 15-17 times (I kinda lost count) and it seemed to be perfect.

2324285,501122,2013/10/20,5,"I enjoyed this.  I used the rice cooker to make this, and had to uses lime zest instead of orange zest.  This rice is perfect with Middle Eastern food."
39835,504104,2013/8/21,5,"These are great! I used regular non-fat plain yogurt, splenda and almond milk and vanilla (skipped the salt) for a great and simple treat! Thanks for sharing!"
724631,494206,2013/4/12,5,"Fantastico! The sauce was light, reminded me of a much-loved sauce at a nearby Italian restaurant.  We doubled the recipe; as a result, our sauce did not thicken up as much, so next time I would add the shrimp later so they won&#039;t overcook.  Served with Recipe #498868 #498868 and Recipe #455758 #455758.  A winning meal. I used the uncooked shrimp in their shell; I am sure they tasted better, but it was a pain to remove the shells at the dinner table.  Made for Spring 2013 Pick-A-Chef."
1706426,494206,2013/6/5,5,Yum!  The only change I made was to add some oyster sauce. Served over rice noodles.  Thanks for posting!
1742738,494206,2014/2/15,4,This is very good recipe and so tasty.  One caution; do not add salt until the last 30 sec before serving.  If you add too early the shrimp loose that sweet taste.
226863,494206,2014/2/16,4,"This is very good, especially when served on top of buttery garlic bread!  Served alone, I didn&#039;t find it to be a spectacular shrimp dish, so couldn&#039;t say it is &quot;the best&quot;.  But loved it with the tomato sauce served as a sandwich with the bread and some lettuce.  Fresh and vibrant flavors. Thanks for sharing!  Made for Best of 2013 tag game."
381180,494206,2014/3/2,3,"Because shrimp cooks so quickly, and to ensure it did not overcook, I let the sauce thicken before adding the shrimp!  Tagged on 02/01 for the Best of 2013 game, due 03/01/2014 with extension."
88099,506966,2014/4/13,5,Excellent with such a simple flavor yet so good.  You could add all kinds of different things to these delicious little nuggets.  We used a sweet and sour sauce to dip them in but I think hot mustard or any other dipping sauce would only add to the flavors.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2014
2061935,512746,2014/6/21,5,"Wow. Not only is this easy, it is pretty and delicious! I made this for company, so I just threw the pecans on top, so that if someone wanted nuts, they could grab from the bottom. This will be my new Christmas morning go-to recipe. Thanks!"
2000123158,512746,2015/4/22,1,I&#039;m afraid to even try it now because it doesn&#039;t seem to be specific about the biscuits.  I&#039;ve got two 7.5 oz with 10 biscuits each.  They want 16 biscuits from 2  16oz each canister?  Possibly the larger biscuits?  I think they should have stated that.  I find these online recipes usually lacking something or another.
169430,517573,2014/8/6,5,"What a tasty change of pace for pork chops. Served with some fresh green beans, Russian Black Bread and BK&#039;s Tom&#039;s Vladivostok Potato Salad. The chops aren&#039;t at all difficult to do and the taste was very enjoyable indeed. In particular the caraway was my favorite addition. Thanks much Lynn."
865936,517573,2014/8/9,5,We enjoyed this very much.  The caraway was a stand-out flavor that made this different from similar dishes in other cuisines.  I used pork cube steak and this came out very tender. CQ
305531,517573,2014/8/12,5,"Yum. I really enjoyed these, especially the caraway. It&#039;s hard to see my thick loin pork chop underneath all of the veggies, lol, but the whole dish was very tasty. Thanks for another keeper, Lynn. Made for Culinary Quest 2014."

2000322160,501621,2015/7/7,5,Its great!! n too easy...I just made it..n dad was so much happy after having it.
1803153592,518494,2014/9/20,5,Sweet but with a little warmth makes the perfect combination of flavors. I recommend this recipe to anyone.
130531,518655,2014/12/5,0,"I wanted to make these.........but where is the caramel? I am not much on the mint flavor, but loved the caramel idea."
658705,495391,2014/10/20,4,"A fine dessert from an unusual pie ingredient. If you have grape vines producing more green or red grapes than you van eat raw, this is the recipe for you. It was for us!"
539686,504280,2013/7/31,5,"This is a winner. My DH, who really finds typical turkey burgers bland enjoyed the spices, which were just right and not overpowering. Thanks for posting, made for ZWT #9."
1072593,509970,2014/9/13,5,"Hey, this Pinterested me, too!  (Care to step into my head?  There&#039;s tons of room.)"
285039,515521,2015/1/2,4,"Tasty alternative to a standard sauerkraut bake for New Year&#039;s.  I absolutely loved the combination of vegetables in this dish, but will not completely drain the sauerkraut next time I make it because I really like the flavor sauerkraut adds."
865936,504280,2013/8/1,5,This is fantabulous!   I&#039;ve never really had a turkey burger before. I loved it! Because of the spices you taste the aroma before you even bite in.
126440,504280,2013/8/4,5,This is the same recipe I&#039;ve used since 1993 from Eating Well Magazine also Recipe #51554.&lt;br/&gt;Make it every summer but use chicken instead.  Love them with Recipe #411958.
2549237,504280,2013/8/7,4,"This burger recipe is really good.  I doubled the recipe as to have enough for dinner tonight and 3 extra for lunch tomorrow.  My husband and kids all really loved it.  I thought that the curry powder was a little overwhelming, so next time I will just leave that out.  I really like that this uses turkey, because it is so much better for you than beef.  Thank you LifeIsGood.  Made for The Caribbean Islands round of ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers."
2652149,493579,2013/1/23,5,I made this last night...everyone loved it.  Thank you!
128473,502527,2018/6/22,5,"5 stars all the way. What a great recipe, it was quick and easy to make with excellent results. The ribs were amazing, tender and juicy. The BBQ sauce was super easy to make with great success. We loved it, I used a Whiskey based BBQ sauce. Thanks for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy again. Made for What's on the Menu Tag game."
6651,506876,2014/1/4,4,"I liked it!  With only one egg, I was nervous that it would be dry, but it was perfect.  I doubled the amount of ham and added half a chopped red bell pepper.  A nice, hot breakfast that came together in a snap on a snowy morning!"
169430,512817,2014/5/3,3,"Well, I wouldn&#039;t call this ice cream, it&#039;s more like a frozen smoothie. While it lacks the appeal of real ice cream it&#039;s a more healthy sub that can help get you past that ice cream craving when you don&#039;t want all of the fat that comes with the real stuff. I think it would be better if the chocolate was blended with the bananas to make a chocolate banana frozen confection. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
2002039288,535690,2018/7/6,5,"Fun and simple recipe for making a truly tricky terrarium! Only problem is that it looks so good that I felt pangs when breaking it up to eat it! Great recipe to make with kids, as long as you make the merangue cacti and chill the mousse first. They can then do almost all the assembling, except for piping in the chocolate mousse, which needs to be done neatly. Let the kids make the graham crackers into &quot;sand,&quot; because they'll like doing the preliminary crushing, and they can press the pulse button on the food processor. (An adult needs to handle the blades, etc. If you don't have a food processor, the kids can just crush the graham crackers until it looks sand-like) Using a good chocolate for the mousse is essential, as that is the most powerful flavor in the whole thing. Also, if you cannot find chocolate rocks, puffed rice cereal makes a convincing pebble layer. All in all, a very clever and fun way to spend an afternoon."
2000740988,499243,2015/12/12,5,"I used 7 cups of plain cheerios, as I had neither cocoa krispies or honey bunches. I added an extra TB of cocoa powder to offset the non-cocoa cereal. I also used a 1/4 cup of butter, rather than 2 TB, because... more butter... don&#039;t judge me! ;)

The beauty of cereal treats is that there are SO many variations to try. I will absolutely be making this one again, though."
2001739024,531172,2017/11/19,0,Aren’t you eating raw eggs?
2001802061,531172,2017/11/20,0,"Seriously, do the eggs cook when added to the warm mixture, or would I be consuming raw or undercooked eggs?"
2001793985,531172,2017/11/21,0,"Until someone answers the raw egg issue, I don't think this is a valid recipe. Has anyone actually tried it using egg beaters?"
2001762661,531172,2017/11/21,0,"You can look for unpasteurized eggs or pasteurized your own. You can get directions online, only takes a few minutes to do it."
2001529401,531172,2017/11/22,5,"Smooth, rich and decadent! I used out as a filing for pie in a cookie crumb crust with whip cream and chocolate shavings on top."
493093,531172,2018/1/12,0,"Egg &quot;Beaters&quot; have no yolks. If you use them, YOU;RE the one who needs to be beaten."
2000377661,531172,2018/1/14,5,"Made for the first time today as a last minute dessert for a Sunday dinner. Did not have the cream for the recipe, so used 2% milk combined with about 4 ounces of creme fraiche. Turned out really good for such a simple dessert! We will for sure make this again. Daughter found out it was a blender recipe and immediately requested it."
2002035735,531172,2018/3/7,5,This is at least 4 times that we have made it!! Everyone loved it!
296809,505493,2013/8/24,5,"Made for a fellow Goddess of ZWT-9 &amp; I was very pleased to find this tasty, easy-fix &amp; ingredient-friendly recipe. Icelanders seldom use salad dressing, but old habits die hard for me &amp; I like making my own as needed. I used my stick-blender, fresh mint from my SIL&#039;s garden &amp; plumped the raisins B4 processing. A quick taste test confirmed this will be ideal for a green salad rich w/fruit ingredients. That is on the menu plan for tonite &amp; a 2nd pic will post tomorrow. :-) - Edited to Add: Used this dressing for a salad w/2 types of lettuce as the base of a mound of fruit including halved grapes, cantaloupe chunks &amp; orange sections. Then I applied the dressing &amp; sprinkled a mix of seeds &amp; nuts bought at a health food store. Pic #2 is posted thx again for sharing your recipe."
254614,497167,2013/3/12,5,"Delicious! I poured the hashbrowns out on a towel and patted them as dry as I could.<br/>I wanted the flavor the sauce and crab meat to really penatrate. I mixed the crabmeat, old bay seasoning, egg and miracle whip dressing instead of mayo. I wanted the tang of that dressing with the old bay seasoning. I then mixed with the hashbrowns. I baked in the oven 30 minutes."
1800836484,507289,2013/12/15,1,"I made this recipe for a &quot;Bacon Explosion&quot; tailgate party, and I left with more than half the tray.  First time I&#039;ve had cookies leftover from a tailgate party.  I might as well have just bought peanut butter/chocolate cookies because there was no bacon flavor to these.  Super easy to make but this recipe doesn&#039;t live up to it&#039;s name.  The cookies are way too delicate, they fall apart on first bite and are &quot;challenging&quot; to remove from your baking stone.  Regarding taste, you get the peanut butter, then the sweet chocolate, and you wonder where the bacon is.  After adding bacon grease to the batter and extra bacon on the top, the &quot;bacon flavor&quot; was still overwhelmed by the peanut butter and chocolate.    My suggestion, skip this."
128473,500507,2013/6/4,5,"These are lovely cookies chef #324612.  We really enjoyed these tasty treats.  Made exactly as written, but only made 1/3 of the recipe.  It gave me a dozen large cookies.  Thank you for sharing Made for New Kids on the Block."
37449,511753,2014/5/6,5,"Delicious!  I used dark chocolate instead of unsweetened.  Very nice and chocolaty! I&#039;ll be making this again, thanks!"
2734669,497452,2013/3/23,4,"I made this for my wife and I. We made it into a scrambled egg style of dish, using our leftover Sunday dinner. It definitely could use some more seasoning than what is called for, but still it was quite good. I added some swiss cheese to the egg and hash scramble. We did enjoy this dish."
1706426,497452,2013/6/4,5,"This was truly delicious! I left out the cole slaw, just because I didn&#039;t have any, but I bet it would be great with it. Thanks for posting, next St. Patty&#039;s day I&#039;ll make it with leftovers! I did make the eggs on the side, thogh."
1052873,504705,2013/9/1,5,These were awesome although I made a couple of changes. I used Crisco instead of coconut oil. I know Costco sells it but I didn&#039;t know what I would do with the rest of it. I used 0% Fage Greek yogurt instead of full fat. I also added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips because I really wanted something chocolate. Tasted like a mounds bar. Made for ZWT9.
114027,504705,2013/9/3,4,Made these as posted but not with the coconut flour. I found the finished muffins to be a little bit on the oily side and they get very firm when chilled. The coconut flavor is wonderful and I enjoyed the little tang from the greek yogurt. Made for ZWT 9.
226867,504705,2014/8/29,5,"I added some chocolate chips, too. Did not have coconut flour or cake flour, so used a 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour with an added teaspoon of cornstarch. Also used fat free Greek yogurt. I expected the taste to be more coconutty, but despite that, these were very good. And I do LOVE coconut. A lot! made for Culinary Quest 2014"
2001819358,498753,2017/11/23,5,This recipe is so easy and the salmon was moist and delicious! The only change I made was I used sea salt in place of salt in the panko mixture. I definitely will make this again soon!
88099,501049,2014/4/13,5,I usually make my own sweet and sour sauce but this even tops it (don&#039;t tell DH)  The flavors go so well together and the habanero sauce gives it the perfect heat element for us.  You could use this for so many different foods as a dipping sauce.  We used it on spinach nuggets so I can just imagine how wonderful it would be on chicken or just about anything you could think of.  I&#039;m so glad I found this as it will be made and shared many time over.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2014
2000791306,501049,2016/1/1,5,"This is delicious.  It can be used as a dipping sauce with so many things, but my favorite so far is to use it as a sauce on pork roast.  It really brings the pork flavor out and livens the dish.  Thank you."
169430,504480,2014/5/4,0,"I&#039;m not giving any stars because I don&#039;t know if my results would be typical or not. For me the cheese wouldn&#039;t smooth out and kept small lumps rather like cottage cheese which I, personally, found a little off putting. Perhaps it might have been smoother done in the food processor but I went by the instructions. The flavors were very nice together. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
612601,495398,2014/2/13,5,Delicious &amp; easy!
2941940,495398,2013/8/12,5,This dish is amazing! I like to add broccoli to it when I add the cornstarch and water.. Makes for a delicious EASY meal!
1706426,507409,2013/10/9,5,Excellent! Thanks for sharing. I did not  add the turmeric but otherwise followed the recipe. Made for my three chefs 2013

2001254468,522349,2018/8/16,5,"This coleslaw is simply delicious. Crunchy, fresh with many flavours breaking through. Just had it with a summer burger and it really made the meal. If you want a fresh side that's quick to make and extremely tasty then this is the coleslay to try! 5 stars all round!"
107135,504185,2013/8/15,5,liked this alotzwt
227978,504185,2013/8/26,5,"There are a lot of wonderful flavors going on in this omelet, Mikekey!  I really love olives, so I thought I&#039;d like this omelet, and boy I was right.  It was yummy.  The little bit of tarragon sprinkled on top actually surprised me, and it turned out to be one of the best additions to the omelet.  Made for ZWT #9 (North Africa)."
169430,504185,2014/4/10,5,"I made .7 of the recipe using 2 eggs and for me that was a large breakfast with all the goodies added in. I love all of the flavors and they combine so well. North African dishes are a favorite of mine and their use of seasonings is superb. I&#039;m very pleased that I chose this for PAC, Spring 2014."
222564,520245,2015/5/10,5,"Packed with flavor! Uses a lot of Worcestershire sauce, but it works great!"
2000236668,506654,2015/5/30,5,"We make this at least once a week. Easy recipe and can find all the ingredients at our local Harris Teeter, including the tahini. Just need a Cuisinart!"
2000222718,522154,2015/5/28,5,yam yam yam! so delicious annnei... .
2001175783,505431,2016/9/19,5,"I'm gluten intolerant so when I found this I thought I'd give it a try. Even though the ingredients are simple, it's packed with flavor! And it's so easy to make. I'll make this over and over again."
2001769827,528742,2017/10/28,1,"The cake for this recipe is horrible. I had to throw the whole thing out, and i didn’t save any of it. It was so oily, and it tasted very weird, and I was so disappointed that I didn’t try the frosting. I bet it is as bad. Maybe this cake could be acceptable if you got rid of most of the oil, but it is not party-worthy. I hope this website has some acceptable food, because this makes it look as if it won’t."
440735,503678,2013/7/15,4,My family enjoyed this! I made as written except I forgot the whip cream. The amount of Whiskey sauce could have been for 2 and more 13x9 pans. I may reduce the Whiskey amount next time but that is personal preference. Made for ZWT9 Gourmet Goddesses
133174,500309,2013/8/4,5,Very good.  The chicken was well flavored and moist.  The chicken was left in the marinade for about 2 hours.  In place of brown rice it was served with Recipe #369399.  I plan to hang on to this recipe and make it again.  Made for ZWT9.
220348,500309,2013/8/7,5,"I love jerk chicken and this was no different. I think marinading the chicken was a great idea, but I also used the marinade to keep the chicken moist throughout the baking."
1925885,522915,2015/8/3,5,"This is a great little shortbread cookie! I must admit I cheated a little because I hate rolling things out in my hot &amp; humid climate. So instead, I made a roll from the dough, wrapped it in plastic and refrigerated it. I slice pieces and make my cutouts from that, then shove the leftovers back onto the roll for the next go-round. This works out great for the DH and I, because we only bake what we&#039;re going to eat! Thanks for posting, Linda! Made for Culinary Quest 2015 by a Toasted Tourist."
461834,493777,2013/4/16,5,"What a tasty mashed tater recipe!!!  I made this as written, although scaled back to serve 2.  I used leftover potatoes that had been made with butter and milk, so I just added the seasonings and cream cheese.  Really loved the flavor of these potatoes.  Great recipe to make when you are making something that you can&#039;t really make gravy from pan drippings.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, I plan to use it as a stuffing when I next make pierogies!!  Made for 2013 Spring PAC event."
131126,507757,2014/4/10,4,I skipped the optional mint and cream the menthe due to personal preference.  The rest made a lovely breakfast drink.  The texture was frothy even with using 1% milk.  Thanks for sharing the recipe! Made for PAC 2014
2000234959,512214,2015/5/30,5,This is an amazing recipe..... with just a few additions. The reason for the additions.... the directions are a little off or missing parts.... so just added a few things. Over all though.... totally amazing.
128473,500192,2013/5/21,4,"This was a nice french toast Aanii Nichii.  I enjoyed it but felt that something was missing for me.  I think this would be awesome with a little herb de provence and a drizzle of pomegranate molasses or honey, to showcase the savory side more.  Thanks for sharing your recipe."
560491,501090,2013/6/20,5,"This was a quick and easy meal to make when I didn&#039;t want to cook in the first place.  I didn&#039;t have quite 16oz of sausage so I sliced it thinly in semi-circles to make it appear like there was more. :)  Since my DSs do not like most of the mixed veggie combos, I only added corn.  Was very good and my DSs who usually refuse to eat potatoes really liked it!  Made for Everyday Holiday."
50969,501090,2013/6/25,4,"I made this on 6/24/13 for mine and my SO&#039;s dinner. The packaging sizes were changed due to what was on hand. I used a 14 oz. pkg. of smoked sausage and a 4.7 oz. box of Au gratin potatoes. I added a bit of chopped onion to the sausage as it was browning. After adding the potatoes and the sauce packet, a smaller amount of water was used (just a little over 2 cups). For the veggies,3/4 cup of peas &amp; carrots were used.After covering, heat was reduce to low and simmered for about 10 more minutes. Then the cheese was added,and covered for about 5 minutes more. Thanks for posting and, &quot; Keep Smiling :) &quot;"
373020,501090,2013/7/7,5,"This is fabulous and cannot recommend it enough to other parents/families.  A great quick meal to have on hand (with 4 children and 3 after school activities, on 3 seperate afternoons, I need fast meals).  I was a little unsure about the box of au gratin potatoes (no such thing is sold here in Australia) so peeled and sliced 5 medium potatoes and 1 sweet potato, then added 1 packet of au grating potato flavouring &quot;three cheese&quot; is what I had in the pantry, other than that, I made it as per the recipe.  Hearty, creamy and filling while being cheap (I sliced 3 kransky sausages thinly).  6 clean plates, 1 happy mummy - this will be made again &amp; again.  Thanks for posting!"
136597,517533,2014/7/31,5,"WOW! This is a delicious recipe.  I added granulated garlic to the chicken and used breadcrumbs (instead of flour) to coat the patties before frying.  Instead of meatballs, I made patties and got 10 good size &quot;burgers&quot;.  They were very moist and tender!  Thank you for posting this recipe.  It will go into my regular rotation!"
314579,517533,2014/8/8,5,"Seriously amazing, one of the best things I&#039;ve eaten in a long time.  Made patties and put on a light rye with lettuce.  I love the fact that it&#039;s half meat and half mushrooms.  I sauteed the mushrooms in half butter half olive oil and got a nice brown to them.  The cooking method keeps these so moist.  I made into 2 different patties, one about 1 inch thick and one about 2 inches, I didn&#039;t know how thick to make them to ensure they cooked through.  I used the suggested timing and they both came out perfect, so I think there is a fair amount of leeway.  Thank you so much, one of my favorite recipes in the Culinary Quest Tour 2014!!"
80353,517533,2014/8/8,0,"Dee-licious!  Like a previous poster, I also used regular bread crumbs instead of panko and made into patties.  Really easy, and excellent instructions.  The whole family gave these 2 thumbs up so they go into our regular roster.  Thanks for giving me more cooking options!"
482933,517533,2014/8/10,5,Awesome aroma was driving hubby nuts. Delicious! Mushrooms paired with ground turkey are perfect. Cut mushrooms tiny first then browned.  Served as main dish (4 per serving) atop couscous medley. Thanks Jackie for posting. Made for Culinary Quest.
1676220,495729,2013/2/20,4,Made this last nite for a quick dinner.  I know this recipe could only have 5 ingredients for the contest but I added about a half cup of chopped onion which I'm glad I did.  Family liked it and said it's a keeper in the comfort food file!!  Good Luck with the contest!!
226863,503182,2013/7/15,5,"Perfect for lunch!  I halved the recipe and had enough for 2 lunch size servings. (Not as sides).  We really enjoyed the flavors.  So easy to make, but very flavorful.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game."
369715,503182,2013/8/16,2,These were just OK for us. We didn&#039;t feel that they had much taste to them. I added more butter and that still didn&#039;t help. I topped it with some cheddar cheese and that helped some.
128473,515694,2014/5/22,5,"Awesome recipe, it made a nice thick, fluffy, tender,  egg flavored pancake.  It was really quick and easy to make.  I fried the pancake in coconut oil, for added flavor.  I served the pancake as a wrap with shredded beef, green onions and mango preserves for a very special treat.  Next time, I will add a  little flaked, sweet coconut, I think it would work great, either in the mix or as an additional  garnish  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, which I will enjoy again.  Made for Name That Ingredient Tag Game."
865936,495310,2013/3/1,4,"Oh, this was sweet, but not quite sassy enough for my taste.  I added a touch of Korean sweet snd sour sauce for a nice kick.  Love the combination of noodles and vegetables."
37449,495310,2013/3/1,5,Delish! I enjoyed all the flavors! I did halve the recipe. Good luck!
220348,495310,2013/3/1,5,"it was sweet and slightly sassy, and made for a very good stir fry. I'm a big fan of stir fry, so this was a nice change to the kind of stir fry I usually do."
131126,495310,2013/3/2,5,We liked this quick stir-fry.  It was sassy enough for the diner who likes mild and had a nice sweetness.  I liked the ease of the sauce. All are pantry ingredients for me so it will be a quick go to on clean out the veggie bin days.  I was surprised by the cooked radishes; we liked them more than expected.  Good luck in the contest!
336058,500218,2013/12/17,3,"As is, it&#039;s a little too bittersweet for me (and I love dark chocolate) and too runny.  I added some chocolate liquid stevia and a touch of honey.  Then I added a little starch to thicken it up and it was good.  I poured on a low sugar chocolate cake and I think it will be a good combo.  Might use refined coconut oil next time, if the kids don&#039;t go for the slight coconut flavor (I hope they do.)"
480195,503260,2013/8/4,5,This was excellent! We loved the combination of spices on the moist fish. This will go into my favorites. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.
592157,499783,2013/7/30,5,"I served this as suggested on buns with mayo, creamy coleslaw, and tomatoes, and aside from the fact that we are big Andy Griffith fans, we really enjoyed this recipe! Even my picky toddler kept asking for more. The description that it is more than the sum of its parts is definately accurate!"
1802794041,499783,2014/6/3,5,This sandwich is definitely better (as the previous reviewer said) than the sum of its parts. The secret is the pepper. When you think you&#039;ve got enough add a little more. I lived in Mt Airy for the years abd it&#039;s the only place I&#039;ve ever been able to find them. Snappy Lunch used to make a good one.
2000689016,524992,2015/12/2,5,Great idea!! Love it!
2189849,524992,2015/12/3,5,A recipe my family would love and request! Great cooking!
2324285,507171,2013/10/7,5,"I love this marinade- very savory and sweet, with a hint of beer flavor.  I used Guinness, and I liked how the bitter flavor combined with the brown sugar.  Will be using this recipe again- thanks!"

2000125003,495779,2015/4/7,0,Made this without chicken and it was easy and fast. I added a bit more garlic and fresh basil and it all came together nicely
453440,495779,2017/9/4,5,"This Stir Fry was &quot;Super Good&quot; and perfect to make using my garden snap peas and red pepper. I know I will make it again and again. I followed the recipe. As per your suggestion, I did increase the grated ginger. The only change I made was to sprinkle some Sesame Oil on the finished Stir Fry. - I did not serve this over rice. DH is a Diabetic. Rice doesn't work for us. - The amount of Stir Fry was perfect for us. (2 people) I'm not sure it would be OK for 4 as listed over 3 cups of rice. They might want more veggies and sauce. However if you want a great tasting Stir Fry, this is it. Thank you Ratherbe Swimmin."
198154,495779,2018/10/12,3,Made this for my family for dinner. Followed the recipe to a T. My family said it was good but didn't have as much flavor as they had hoped it would. Next time I'll try increasing the garlic and ginger and making more sauce.
204024,511601,2014/3/30,5,This made a tasty and easy glaze for boneless skinless chicken thighs.   I think it is meant for a whole chicken but we don&#039;t cook chicken that way.  Made for Aus swap.
340141,503603,2013/7/16,5,"Astounding, perfect texture on these meatballs.  I&#039;m sitting here wondering if I can convert my Mom&#039;s Italian meatball recipe to this panade use.  And so easy to cook via baking.  The high heat resulted in really nicely browned bottoms.   The flavor was very good, as well.   Thanks so much for a great dinner!  ZWT9"
216999,503603,2013/7/20,5,"Wow, these meatballs were really tasty and easy to make!  I loved the baking instructions, the time and temperature were right on.  The sauce was great as well.  I could see making regular meatballs this way as well.  The family loved these, they are going into the favorites file!  Made for Pink Panthers on the Prowl for ZWT9."
482933,503603,2014/3/10,5,"Perfectly delicious! Taste, texture, timing, and of course I love the cooking technique. Roasted asparagus at same time so was ultra easy.  Thank you for posting."
2001928915,519087,2018/1/13,5,i love dump recipes! I don't have a crockpot so i made this on the stove...obviously it didn't take as long. Rich and creamy...I will definitely make this again
2597942,505988,2013/9/14,5,"OMG... How have I gone this many years without even of thinking to add sliced bananas to this? I&#039;ve made my strawberry shortcakes like this &#039;forever&#039;, and never realized that it could be improved upon by adding another fruit. Love it! Now I&#039;m thinking of maybe adding chocolate, or pineapple, or caramel (like a &quot;banana split&quot; strawberry shortcake). LOL. I used the individual little shortcake cups that are pre-packaged and used real whipping cream to top them.  I will post a photo when I get them off of hubbys cellphone camera. They are &quot;lovely and delicious&quot;. I&#039;m making them again for a cook-out we are hosting this weekend for our neighborhood and family.  Thank you for opening new doors for an old classic. (Made for PRMR)"
369715,505988,2013/9/23,4,"This was good and easy to make. I didn&#039;t add as much sugar as the recipe called for, I just sprinkled it on. We all enjoyed these."
169430,493757,2013/1/23,5,Lovely change up for flavors. I really enjoyed the fennel seed. Only needed two servings tonight so cut this back and and the reduction came out just fine. It makes a hearty dish that is completed with a small green salad. The lentils and chicken compliment each other very well and would certainly make this again.
2001058688,513933,2018/3/24,0,"There is something wrong - 2 cups Couscous to 2 and a third stock doesn't work, you need way more stock - did you mean 1 cup couscous? this is a disaster = =too bad, it sounded good"
461834,497569,2013/3/26,5,"Wonderful rolls!!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe to serve with our Sunday lasagna dinner!!!  I ended up rolling 8 balls, instead of 12, to make for the 4 of us!!  We all loved them!!!  DS and his girlfriend took the leftovers home.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring 2013 PAC."
1287956,524236,2015/11/4,5,"There is a lot of chopping to do in this, but the taste is worth it.  It was mild enough for our Tender Tongue, but flavorful enough that the Chili-head was able to add his peppers to spice it up.  Great for taco shells, tortillas, or even just by itself."
1802640154,513113,2014/4/3,5,The buns turn out very soft and nice.Just abit too sweet.perhaps can reduce the sugar.Overall is a very good recipe.
2727323,497164,2013/3/11,5,These are the best party food. So yummy! A portable baked potato!
2734801,497164,2013/3/13,5,Actually these are great with just a salad and so easy to make.
318262,517603,2014/9/6,4,This made for a hearty and delicious vegetarian main meal! I really loved the brown rice in broth technique and I&#039;m gonna use that method a bunch. The brown rice was still a bit crunchy when all the water was soaked up and the timer went off. Next time I will add it into the cold water and bring to a boil. Thanks for the new recipe!
724631,510501,2014/1/18,4,"Sublime taste and easy peasy!  We found that 3 hours @ 350F is too long, our meat was overcooked.  At this temperature, 2 hours should be sufficient.  A food processor raced through the prep.  Plan to hang around to enjoy the aroma while roasting.  Made for Photo Tag."
2681012,494797,2013/2/6,5,"I loved this dish, it was the best tasting mac and cheese I've had.  The shrimp was a delightful surprise!"
2681788,494797,2013/2/7,5,"I really love this Mac and Cheese. The nutmeg, the shrimp and the spinach were great. The feta also gave it a very nice flavor!"
136997,494797,2013/2/27,5,"One change I will make next time is, I won't rinse the pasta. I had some liquid in the bottom at the end of the baking time. An issue might have been, I didn't drain the noodles well enough, but overall it was a tasty dish. :)"
2001733058,501727,2017/9/28,0,It's Tulkoff Horseradish BTW! No other is better!
39835,515625,2014/5/10,4,Very good - I had some short ribs that I got on sale in the freezer that I wanted to use and found this recipe - very good but also very spicy but this is probably my chili powder - I also kept mine on &quot;warm&quot; for a long time. I used a package of baby carrots and skipped the scallions - a great dinner which my family enjoyed. Thanks for sharing!
1620171,503975,2013/7/21,3,"This was quite nice, however the qty seemed a bit off for the rice to shrimp ratio, along with the lemon juice. The title bogged down in rice suggested that there should be more rice than shrimp, however based on my efforts tonight, I think it is a little off. I ended up doubling the rice (after changing the serves to 2 people) and even with that, found the lemon was quite strong. Overall, a nice flavour and an easy meal. Thank you for sharing. Made for ZWT 9 for the Tasty Testers."
128835,517687,2014/11/12,5,"Easy and very, very delicious.  Used as dressing for a chicken burrito salad bowl.  A real keeper."
2731946,497135,2013/3/11,5,This is great - cheese & salsa - what more could you want! I'm not a great cook - but this one I can even make for the best hubby in the world!
2732153,497135,2013/3/11,5,"Fantastic recipe! Really tasty, too!"
2732172,497135,2013/3/11,5,Not your ordinary side dish - goes perfect with chix - so easy!
169430,510203,2013/12/24,5,This is the second non breaded and fried cube steak recipe that I have tried recently and it&#039;s another winner. My only alteration was to use all beef broth and no sherry. My DH is a real cube steak fan and it&#039;s great to find some different and yummy ways to use them. The mushrooms were the high point of the plate and would be lovely made alone and served with many other things. They would be perfect made with chicken broth and served with baked chicken for instance.
732280,496258,2018/7/16,5,I have made this many times in the past. Serve over rice and add some sliced portabella mushrooms after sauteing them in butter. Put them in after you cook for about 1/2 the time.
2740009,496858,2013/3/17,5,"I love this recipe! This is the best spinach and artichoke dip I&#039;ve ever had. This was always my go to appetizer at restaurants but now I can&#039;t order it anymore...nothing compares to this recipe. I&#039;ve made this several times and everyone asks for the recipe. I didn&#039;t need to make any changes, very good as is. It&#039;s good cold too. Thanks for the recipe!"
2750743,496858,2013/3/24,5,Excellent recipe! Made this for a get together and everyone asked for the recipe. I love the spicy kick the red pepper flakes add and garlic makes everything better. Wouldn&#039;t change a thing. This recipe is a keeper!
2900273,496858,2013/7/13,5,Just what I was looking for! Great recipe...love it hot or cold. I made this for a family gathering and I got rave reviews. Who wants to order this out when it&#039;s so much better made at home? Will for sure be making this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.
2935688,496858,2013/8/8,5,Mmmm....so good! Never had spinach dip with spice to it...I really liked the little of spice the pepper flakes added to this. I used the full amount of pepper flakes and it wasn&#039;t overly spicy at all but if you don&#039;t care for that then add a little less....I wouldn&#039;t omit it though because in my opinion that&#039;s what makes it so good. Can&#039;t wait to make it again for company!
2846202,496858,2013/12/9,5,"Wow! This is a delicious dip and so easy to make. Thanks for sharing, I made it exactly as posted, it needs no tweaking! Definitely a favorite at my holiday party."
498271,501075,2013/7/11,5,What a terrific and easy meal!  I don&#039;t care for blue cheese so used feta and a generous sprinkling of crushed black pepper instead.  A healthy and flavorful dinner that&#039;s ready in minutes - can&#039;t beat that - thanks for sharing the recipe!
2067245,501075,2014/2/20,5,These were so good! and what a lovely picture. I didn&#039;t change a thing.

2597942,496146,2014/4/25,5,"These are awesome! Pot stickers are probably my favorite Chinese dish on the planet. I&#039;ve been making homemade pot stickers ever since my favorite Chinese restaurant burned down and never rebuilt. I could never quite copy theirs, but I must say ForeverMama&#039;s are the closest yet. I made them pork as directed, but I did double the dipping sauce. I started with the suggested amounts and then added a splash of this and a pinch of that until I found the perfect balance... YUMMY! The only ingredients I had to pick up at the store was the gyoza wrappers and the Napa cabbage, everything else I had on hand (even the ginger root that I keep frozen). I will definitely add these to my menu ever time I make a Chinese dinner. Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)"

169430,514156,2014/5/28,5,"Oh my, this is almost as good as an actual visit to the islands! The pineapple, lime and dark rum are really outstanding. Had to use the gas grill but you just have to use what you have right?. I added some lime juice to the rice also and it was one delicious dinner with a strawberry and coconut salad on the side. :D"
227978,493382,2013/2/28,5,"Awesome, and so easy to prepare.  It's great having single-serving recipes like this for those occasions when you don't want to make a whole batch that ultimately end up going to waste.  And it's really quite a tasty hot chocolate recipe, too. Thanks for posting your recipe, Laura2of7."
2000349699,522725,2015/7/19,5,We love this salad on a hot summer day. Skipped the nuts and balled the melon for a little fun texture. A refreshing hit with everyone!
2000356764,522725,2015/7/23,5,We just made a Danforth. Swapped out the strawberries for cherries. It was great. Loved it. Will definitely make it again.
169430,502731,2015/3/1,5,Delicious. I cut the amount back to 2 servings and used two big chicken thigh&#039;s. Simply loved the great flavor profile. I did include a healthy teaspoon of Ras El Hanout as well as I had just made a fresh batch last week and it was right at home and played nice with everyone else in the pot. A perfect dinner served on almond couscous and some hot mint tea. YUM!
296809,504672,2013/8/4,5,"Made as written for the Goddesses of ZWT-9 (except for the addition of lemon pepper &amp; croutons) &amp; I can testify this recipe makes a great bowl of soup! It is delicious, ingredient-friendly &amp; an incredibly easy-fix. The flavor of the blue cheese is prominent, but not overly so. The soup tastes creamed w/o cream added except what might be in the cheese. AND the finishing touch of the crisped bacon added a salty textural crunch to further please the palate. Thx for sharing this outstanding recipe w/us. :-)"
1925885,504672,2013/8/9,5,"Wow.  Simply wonderful soup.  DH, who never wants to express a rating opinion, insists I give it five stars... and I concur!  The flavor and texture of the soup is amazing. We tasted it before adding the thickening and it was perfect as it was.  Adding the thickening changed it somewhat and we won&#039;t use it in the future.  The soup is very rich and you don&#039;t need a big bowlful unless you want to tempt cardiac fate! It would be the perfect starter for a dinner party. Thanks so much for posting a wonderful recipe!  Made for team Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
226863,504672,2014/10/12,5,"Wonderful soup!  I will definitely be making this soup many times throughout the winter!  So creamy, even without any milk or cream.  Loved the saltiness of the blue cheese and bacon.  Only thing I added was some freshly ground black pepper.  Thanks for sharing!"
679953,504672,2015/1/8,5,"Wonderful soup... Message from DS..Keep the recipe.   The bleu cheese flavor really stands out, and will be kept.   Liked the bacon/ blue cheese mixture too.  A great soup for a really cold night here.  Went real well with a broccoli/cauliflower casserole we had for dinner tonight.  Made for FYC."
1803636899,511483,2015/1/9,1,"Needs lots of adjustments.  We tried it as per the recipe and it wasn&#039;t what we had hoped for.  We made some additions - 1 T. butter, 1 c. cream, 1/4 t. mace and one more garlic clove.  That was better but still not what we wanted.  Seems to need less leek and more potato and use half-and-half instead of veggie stock.  That would mean cooking the potatoes in a different pan and adding them already cooked.   Use mace or nutmeg instead of rosemary.  Would probably be better if half of the leeks and potatoes were pureed after cooking to thicken the brew."
226863,513389,2014/3/8,5,"I&#039;m a big avocado fan!  I really loved the creaminess that the yogurt added to the dressing.  I guessed at the amount of red wine vinegar to suit my taste, and was happy with the result.  I did let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours, and thought the flavors blended nicely.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game!"
37449,513389,2014/3/26,5,"I too love avocado and this was a delight! I didn&#039;t have yogurt, so used sour cream.  Thanks~!"
369715,495549,2013/2/17,5,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I cooked mine on high for three hours and three hours on low and the meat was perfect. It was so tender and tasty. I shredded mine and let it sit in the gravy. Everyone ate the roast as a sandwich. My boys normally don't eat roast but both ate two sandwiches.
33159,495549,2013/5/12,5,"We thought this was FANTASTIC!!  I did, however, make a few changes due to personal preferences: I sifted the dehydrated onions out of the soup mix &amp; just used the powder; I didn&#039;t use the mushroom soup - just put 2 cups of water in the bottom of the crockpot before adding the &quot;rubbed&quot; roast; for the gravy, I used all the liquid &amp; thickened on the stove with cornstarch.  Awesome flavour!!"
2002080765,495549,2018/3/28,5,Didn't change a thing other than using sea salt in place of season salt (since that was what I had on hand). This was probably the best roast I've ever made. Super easy and so flavorful. The gravy was a delicious complement to the meat and to the mashed potatoes I made as a side. Definitely will make it again.
67728,527823,2016/8/26,5,"Well, these were quite a roller coaster ride for me, lol! I messed them up, but didn't catch my mistake until it was too late, so I just ran with it. After I made my three rolls, I was out of the walnut mixture but still had another 9 sheets of phyllo left over. I went back and reread the recipe, and realized that I had misunderstood it and made each of my rolls with only three sheets of the phyllo instead of 6. Since there was no way I was unrolling the three rolls to add the extra phyllo, I just used the remaining sheets to make two other types of cookies: I made two rolls filled with cinnamon and coconut sugar, and I made a third roll filled with raspberry orange mango jam. The cinnamon sugar ones I cut into logs, and the jam filled roll I sliced just like the walnut filled ones. The cinnamon sugar logs were actually pretty good, but the jam filled ones were just way too sweet. They baked up pretty, because they spread into rose shapes once the jam melted, but I ended up throwing them away because if something is too sweet for ME, I know no one else will be able to handle them, lol. The walnut filled ones were good with just the three sheets of phyllo in them, but they were really fragile. I baked these for the full 30 minutes, but I think I could've shaved off a minute or two, because some of the bottoms were starting to get a little bit burnt at 30 minutes. I poured the syrup over the baked cookies, but it seemed to just go right through them to the bottom of the pan. I tried one of the warm walnut filled ones, and was kind of disappointed because they were super-sweet and kind of dry. I thought about it for a minute, and realized that what I needed to do was: 1. Keep spooning the syrup over the cookies, flipping them periodically so the syrup wouldn't just sit and make the bottoms soggy, and 2. Allow these to cool. After I got the syrup to start soaking into the whole cookies, I popped the whole pan into the fridge. Not long enough to chill them, but just long enough to make everything a bit less squishy and more cohesive. Once I did those two things, these became much more like the familiar texture of baklava, and it tamed the sweetness a bit. No getting around it, syrup-soaked phyllo pastries are gonna be really sweet regardless, but letting them cool first keeps the sweetness from being overly cloying. These definitely need a time out after baking to be their best selves. In the end, these tasted good enough to be comparable to the little Greek phyllo pastries on a tray that my mom buys for the holidays. Thanks for posting, sheepdoc! Made for CQ 2016 Greece for Team Iota Eta Pi"
169430,505243,2014/4/30,5,"Some of the best oven fries that I&#039;ve ever had. Wonderfully seasoned with bold flavor. Easy to do and they vanish quickly. Keeper recipe. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
1179225,505243,2014/5/24,5,Delicious! Simple and flavorful. Thanks for posting the recipe.
945395,507593,2013/11/29,5,"While I do have my own holiday mac and cheese recipe, I wanted to try this unique recipe. I&#039;m glad I did. Halving the recipe, I baked this in individual-serving dishes and my family loved it. The one regret is we had no turkey to go with it! Out of personal preference I used only 1/3 of the white pepper -- but used all of the onion powder and mustard powder -- and the combined flavors were great. Following the instructions for the flour addition, I found only a small amount of flour was needed, since the Velveeta and evaporated milk added a creaminess of their own. The macaroni and cheese baked up creamy and delicious, and the buttered breadcrumb topping turned out perfectly. UPDATE 11-28-2013: I prepared this once again, this time exactly as written. Everyone pretty much agreed this tasted even better this time... The difference? I added all of the white pepper listed in your recipe. By gosh and by golly... it was fantastic! Thanks ChefPisces. I have all of your recipes saved!"
2733922,497376,2013/3/12,5,A great weeknight meal for busy moms!
2719902,497376,2013/3/12,0,"Put this in the crock pot this morning- just tasted a little sample, it is wonderful and super easy.  I can't wait to share this classic with friends and family  ."
2733935,497376,2013/3/12,5,Excellent idea! easy to put together and then its ready to enjoy at the end of a busy day!
2734351,497376,2013/3/12,5,"This is such a clever recipe with a great twist to a classic recipe.  I love that it has incorporated the ever so popular crockpot.  With this dish, a family can still have that down home cooking with an easy crockpot dish."
2734292,497376,2013/3/12,5,I love to use my slow cooker & this is great!
2737157,497376,2013/3/14,5,THis is a great meal to throw together before you leave for work! THis is a very tasty meal that will satisfy everyone!
2001999113,497376,2018/2/18,5,Mine didn't come out looking much like a meatloaf but let me tell you it was absolutely fabulous! My husband had 3 plates and he's not a big guy. Picture is of his first ridiculously sized portion. I added about 1/3 cup chopped onion to the meat and next time will only cook 6 hours. We just used a spoon to serve. Couldn't be easier to make. I'm sharing this recipe with friends.
744760,493999,2013/6/8,5,"Perfect caramel sauce, the best I&#039;ve ever made.  Creamy, doesn&#039;t sugar later, easy to make and reheat---it stays fluid.  I don&#039;t detect a flavor of maple so this sauce is versatile and delicious on cinnamon rolls, ice cream, panna cotta---lovely is the best way to describe it."
80353,504766,2013/7/31,5,"We all loved this salad/salsa (it can be used just like a salsa, I think).  Delicately spiced, little flashes of heat that don&#039;t overwhelm, and the sweet, sweet papaya.  Delicious."
169430,501146,2013/6/21,5,"This turned out to be a delicious and forgiving recipe. I&#039;m ashamed to admit this but it&#039;s true, I got out all of the ingredients and had them waiting on the counter. All went well and smoothly, the dish came together looking very tempting and sumptuous  over the rice when plated. It was yummy and I made a mental to say a special thank you to it&#039;s creator. When taking the empty dishes to the sink I then saw an open can of tomatoes and some olives sitting there waiting for me. Oh the embarrassment, lol, I can only say that it was delicious even with two missing ingredients. As I said, a marvelous and forgiving recipe that I highly recommend."
80353,501146,2013/6/22,4,"Very tasty indeed, and no one complained at dinner.  I did feel that the black olives felt out of place with the cream - or maybe that&#039;s just a combination my family and I don&#039;t care for, but we did end up picking them all out.  Good luck, chef."
323186,501146,2015/11/11,5,"We really enjoyed this, remarkable melange of flavour and really delicious!  I did miss out the asparagus because I&#039;m not that fond of it, but stayed true to recipe otherwise.  Great dinner and definitely that bit different!!

461834,492962,2013/3/22,5,"Awesome meatloaf!!!  I made a mini loaf for DH and I to have for dinner last night.  He doesn&#039;t care for any type of bell pepper, so I left it out, didn&#039;t saute the onion in shortening (just added the  raw minced onion to the mix).  It included butter in the ingredient section but didn&#039;t say what to do with it in the instructions, so I just guessed and spread it on top of the loaf, after scoring it.  Towards the end of the cooking time, I added a little pick of ketchup for a topping.  We really enjoyed the added seasonings that I don&#039;t normally have in my mix.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe Jtrillich!!  Made for Spring PAC 2013."
220348,505490,2013/10/8,5,"This was really good and felt like fall weather. It went really well with chicken and with salmon, so it is very versatile with what it goes with. I also found that it refrigerates very well."
1066936,530024,2017/12/3,0,Love this from Pastas in Syracuse. Can’t wait to see how this stacks up!!
2000170157,530024,2018/9/8,5,This is si simple yet sooooo good! Will be making this again.
220348,503990,2013/7/17,5,What a nice way to indulge the sweet tooth. I&#039;ve tried alot of store bought chocolate syrups and found that your homemade version is much better. It&#039;s purer in taste and lacks that strange taste that comes with all the added stuff to make the syrup last longer.
1925885,503990,2013/7/17,5,"What a yummy syrup!  How it thickens up is a mystery to me, but it does.  The heat is subtle - you don&#039;t taste it, but you feel it ever so gently.  Delicious!"
80353,503990,2013/7/18,5,"Jostlori recommended this recipe to me and I&#039;m glad I tried it out as it&#039;s very easy to make, good and just a &#039;tad&#039; different.  I made a half batch.  The residual heat left by the cayenne is a very nice addition to the chocolate sauce."
542159,503990,2013/7/19,4,"The cayenne gives this chocolate syrup a lovely kick. Cut the recipe down and made using dark cocoa powder because that is what I had on hand. Very close to one I make all the time, thanks for the post."
1226388,503990,2013/7/20,5,"This is delicious and easy to make with things I always have on hand.  I was unsure about the cayenne, but it is really good! Made for ZWT9"
296809,503990,2013/7/21,5,"Made for ZWT-9, this recipe has captured the attention of the Goddesses &amp; I&#039;m following in the footsteps of my teammates Jostlori &amp; evelyn/athens. I made a full recipe as written &amp; used it to make Recipe #232918, #232918 by momaphet. It worked perfectly &amp; I&#039;ve decided to call the combo &quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot;. Thx for sharing this easy-fix &amp; tasty recipe w/us. :-)"
447487,503990,2013/7/27,5,"Delicious !! 500 Stars !! :D A lovely chocolate syrup on ice cream and that kick of heat really made it extra special. I used cane sugar in place of granulated. Thanks for the recipe, Nif! Will be keeping this on hand at all times and so easy to make! Made during ZWT#9 for my team, Tasty Testers :)"
1803371587,495021,2014/11/19,4,I had to make a few changes due to dietary restrictions. I used coconut oil in place of the butter in equal amounts. I used canned coconut cream and for the topping I did not care for the flours so I eliminated them this time. I used only 2 T. coconut oil melted in place of the butter since the flours were not used. My family liked it so much they asked for it for Thanksgiving. Five of us are Paleo due to health reasons. So nice to have a recipe to be added to our family dinners permanently. This is awesome.
724631,500209,2015/1/24,4,"Delightfully rich chocolate cake that was moist, perfect!  The icing was more like fudge cement for me, and I would appreciate some kind pointers on making it drizzle more easily.  Please let me know what else I could do, or I will have to attempt The Joy of Cooking&#039;s boiled fudge icing to use instead."
126440,516987,2016/1/12,5,Loved this salad with curried mushroom lentil burger.  The salad was the perfect compliment for this meal.  Loved the combination of the apple and other ingredients.  The dressing was such a surprise.Loved it.
2340001,527388,2018/11/11,5,This is the exact recipe my mom made every year for Thanksgiving using the turkey drippings. It's so good my family always joked about wanting a little turkey with our gravy. Super rich and full of flavor!
724631,505557,2013/11/18,5,"Wonderful manly flavor, love the &quot;paste&quot; so there is not a lot of liquid dripping from the meat.  I marinated my steak for 7 hours, letting the steak come to room temperature for 1 hour prior to cooking.  As usual, I seared the steak and then baked it for 15 minutes at 350 to get a nice medium-rare throughout my steak, and then let the steak rest for 5 minutes before serving.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag game."
549519,507782,2013/10/15,5,"Thank your for this recipe!  I was in Sweden a few months back and ate my weight in these gems!  I have been craving the similar taste and tried many recipes.  The addition of cardamom is key and what I think the other recipes were missing.  I adore cardamom and always have this in stock.  As somewhat of a spice snob, I recommend purchasing the pods and grinding your own.  I found mine at a local Indian market. The stuff in the grocery store does not compare in flavor.  Plus the aroma of grinding your own cardamom is such a treat!  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing!"
1060667,517511,2017/2/22,0,"Wow, for a microwave cake, and one not including egg, this was fantastic!! So moist and perfect with a little vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on top, I had a little of both :) Oh instead of the water I did milk, just to maybe add a little more richness. I also felt like you could add anything to this recipe to make it your own, so I added some chocolate chips and slivered almonds. Coconut, almonds or even marshmallows would make a great addition. Can't wait to make again!!"
2001412887,517511,2017/3/2,0,It turned out HORRIBLE!! I actually stinked up my whole house doing this recipe. I usually (not to brag) am a fabulous baker. Any tips to help me improve this recipe?
1524156,510280,2018/5/20,4,"My review is for the topping alone. While the flavor was good, it was so gooey, it never set up and became firm, eating it required a plate and fork. Had to make,something else easier to eat without utensils for the event I'd hoped to take it to."
2001514165,517511,2017/4/30,0,For my first attempt not great than I add the oil to the butter and left the mixture in the microwave for three minutes and roughly twenty seconds and then I let it cool down for a bit
2001310201,517511,2017/7/25,1,"1 star is not enough to describe how horrible this was. It didn't even turn out to be a brownie. It just messed up my mug. I'm glad I washed it out asap, or else it would have never come out. DO NOT TRY THIS. It looked like burnt ashes, and it smelled like burnt popcorn. I hate you"
2001916372,517511,2018/1/6,0,It was burning and turned my smoke detector off. Do not try or attemp
2001955084,517511,2018/1/26,1,"It could've been better, but it turned out just awful. It has no chemical leavening agent, like baking soda/powder to help it rise, and it was just that bad, that I'm going to have to throw it out. A waste of ingredients, time, and money. I tried to make it taste better with ice cream, and it didn't help at all! The person who made this truly tasteless."
2002112125,517511,2018/4/13,1,it was mushy and wet and did not rise but tasted and smelled like a real brownie
2002162580,517511,2018/5/23,1,all im gonna say is i need to buy a new mug...
128473,493322,2013/4/13,5,"I love coconut rice and this delicious recipe certainly does not disappoint.  Quick and easy to make, it was perfectly cooked.  Just the right amount of coconut flavor, couldn&#039;t ask for more.  It was simply delicious served with recipe #422915 and recipe #472170.  It was the best side ever.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Lazyme, which has gone into my keepers box.    Made for Pac Spring Safari 2013."
542159,493322,2013/8/18,5,Yum! I made this for breakfast this morning topping with a little fresh mango. When I started to make this I found I did not have enough coconut milk so whipped up a cup of Recipe #187372 to make up the difference and it worked out great. DH loved this. Thanks for the post.
219942,493322,2013/8/20,5,"Oh my goodness! This was the most moist and tasty rice. I served it as part of a Thai meal, and thought that I might put butter on the table because I had no real sauce to put over it. Forget about sauce or gravy here. This rice needs nothing more than a fork and a plate! DH raved over it also. This recipe is going into my Tried and True Faves. Thanks, lazyme! ZWT9"
284897,493322,2013/8/22,5,"Served this with Thai chicken and peanut sauce, and it was lovely.&lt;br/&gt;The fragrance whilst cooking was just wonderful.&lt;br/&gt;Can&#039;t go wrong with this recipe, it was loved by all the family."
133174,493322,2013/8/22,5,A perfect companion for Recipe #482610.  Loved the flavors of this fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk.  Made for ZWT9.
724631,493322,2014/3/19,5,"Coconut power, no subtlety!  Possibly the richest rice, on the sweet side, it was a good counterpoint to Recipe#33875 and simply steamed broccoli.  I scaled the recipe to 2 2/3 servings to use one 14.5-oz. can of coconut milk, and the rest of the measurements worked out easily.  Stay close to a recommended 1/2 cup serving size because this was very filling. Made for Zaar Stars Tag."
1803055074,502388,2014/8/23,5,Very easy and very delicious. My husband loved them and wanted more after they were gone. Next time I will double the recipe
2001427384,502388,2017/3/10,5,
2549504,496291,2014/3/8,5,"Excellent way to get healthy fats in to your diet. Especially good for low carbers, diabetics, or people on a ketogenic diet."
1510016,515631,2018/4/4,5,"Delicious! Using what I had on hand, I subbed chicken tenderloins, frozen biscuits (baked while the filling cooked), and dried thyme. The celery wasn't quite as tender as I'd like, but that's likely due to the shorter cooking time of the tenderloins."
895132,518260,2014/10/20,5,"Wonderful dish! I&#039;ve had a recipe for sicilian caponata for ages which I wanted to make - nearly exactly the same as this recipe - and now finally I did it, and we both loved it. Funny thing, because we both neither like celery nor capers LOL I halved the recipe and we ate the whole thing for dinner :) This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for For you Consideration"
2001928602,529705,2018/1/13,5,I've made this multiple times! Perfect balance of flavor and heat. Great on ribs
2002345991,529705,2018/11/22,5,I had to taste test a couple different burbons to find the right one. I added a bit (about a shots worth) more of the whiskey to the sauce too. Gives it a really nice complexity. This sauce is spicy and super tasty. Thanks for this great Recipie.
2597942,514164,2014/3/10,5,"Seriously... it worked! LOL... Thanks, dear. Lunch was great! Enjoyed it with Recipe #514129. I used white farm-house cheddar &amp; sourdough bread. Too funny. (Although I have to admit that it took me over an hour to locate my iron). What a fun time!!!  I laughed all the way though the process!!! :D  When I took hubby a sandwich and left-over soup for lunch today, and I told him that I &quot;ironed&quot; him a sandwich, he thought I had completely lost it! I can&#039;t wait until we go up to our cabin (with NO electricity) and put my &#039;wrought iron&quot; iron on the camp fire and make these for the grand-kids! What fun!!!"
128473,501149,2013/6/23,4,"This was a lovely recipe, full of great flavors.  Loved the addition of the tomatoes, asparagus, cucumber and carrots, they really added texture to the rice dish.  The grilled chicken was wonderful, very flavorful and tender.  The marinade was excellent, so yummy, wish I would have reserved some for drizzling on the cooked chicken, before i put the chicken in to marinate overnight.  A lovely use of contest ingredients - Good luck in the contest."
212609,510906,2013/12/17,5,"Simple store cupboard items come together to make a most delicious rub.&lt;br/&gt;I rubbed mine liberally all over some beautiful fat pork loin chops, left them for fifteen minutes, and then threw them onto the grill.&lt;br/&gt;The chops were sweet and  smoky, with a nice herbiness about them, which we thoroughly enjoyed.&lt;br/&gt;Looking forward to trying it again on other meats this summer!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
695933,510906,2013/12/20,5,"I two time this so I have on hand for the one I forgot about on the holidays (I use your notes step #2) I too like Noo am Looking forward to trying it again on other meats this summer! I use it today on some pork chops, came out delicious. THANK YOU! PRMR 2013....Grpa"
37449,510906,2013/12/30,5,I used this to season up a vegetarian chili and it gave great flavor! Thanks!
1783373,510906,2014/5/25,5,Very good seasoning mix with great flavor.  I made it to season rosie316&#039;s &quot;Recipe #516009&quot; and it came out fabulous.  Good thing I have some more stored-up to season up more meats.  Will try using this to season up meats for the grill this summer (which is right around the corner).  Thank you rosie316 for a keeper.  Tagged it for PRMR.
128473,510906,2014/8/5,5,"What a lovely rub Rosie, thank you for posting it.  I love that it is made from ingredients always found in the pantry.  It was quick and easy to throw together and tastes great. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used the rub on chicken thighs which I baked then doused in your recipe #510968 for a terrific dish.  Made for Culinary Quest - for the Suitcase Gourmets."
1058097,510906,2014/9/17,5,"You made me run out of paprika, waaaaaaah! ;)  I used this on a roast for my husband&#039;s birthday.  It was peppy without being too peppery--very nice.  Thanks for posting!"
171084,510906,2015/1/18,5,Oh my what a rub!!  Love that there was no sugar in it.  Full of flavor - not too spicy and delish on the oven baked ribs.  We did cut back a bit on the cayenne pepper but that was the only change I made. Thanks for 2 great recipes that fed us well tonight!  I&#039;ll be using this rub again and again!
2002234643,510906,2018/7/30,5,love it. I use rub on baby back ribs.
226863,513655,2014/3/4,5,"I made this last night for a really great dinner!  The marinade is really great, and doesn&#039;t take long to mix up.  I marinated for about 5 hours, and cut a tenderloin into boneless &quot;chops&quot;.  So tender and juicy, with just the right flavors!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game."
2897317,500707,2013/7/10,0,These were terrible and a complete waste of good flour!  One of my sons said they tasted &quot;toxic.&quot;   They went straight in the garbage.  Thumbs down from all five family members.  Every other gluten-free recipe I&#039;ve tried has been much better than this. I think the problem is that there is too much brown rice flour in this one.
2001359026,500707,2017/1/20,5,These were excellent! It's hard to find good gluten free recipes. Yum.
2225297,501939,2014/7/21,5,"Yum, delicious lemon flavour.   I love potatoes and could eat these every day."
2000304058,522517,2015/6/29,5,"this was very tasty! perfect amount of crunch and flavor. I usually don&#039;t like fish mixed with a lot of ingredients, but this had the right amount of flavor that made it the perfect balance. the pesto sauce was amazing!"
2000304085,522517,2015/6/29,5,"Amazing fish tacos....the sauce compliments the wrap very well and the fish is light but very tasty!!!
Perfect dish for a bbq or a family dinner.
Would definitely recommend to anyone."
2001351460,511497,2017/1/14,5,"Made it with the kids. Part of a series of life lessons. We soaked it overnight and made a hash with bacon, onions, potato and carrots. Kids loved it. I loved it. Great experience. I used 4 cups of whole wheat flour and abut 1.5 cups of water. I am 6'2&quot;, 235. If you are not large and strong, use more water or a mechanical mixer."
2001360845,511497,2017/1/21,5,Great
2001388999,511497,2017/2/12,0,Swans awesome worked percfectly
2001732061,511497,2017/9/27,5,"Mostly, hard tack and related was made before roller mills were extensively used for flour milling, which means the flour was stone-ground whole meal. And, modern, pure seed was not available, so the grain going into the mills was more of a mix, and would contain several closely related varieties of wheat, along with some other cereal grains such as oats and rye. Bottom line, the flour was whole meal, and not as strong as modern bread flour or possibly more like whole meal pastry flour. A house or shop handling such dough on a regular basis, without modern sanitation would be a haven for sourdough, and thus, the product would have some sourdough character, even if not in the recipe. Sourdough fermentation would/does significantly add to hard tack's keeping qualities, and its nutritional benefits. The bottom line is that whole meal, sourdough crackers, are more authentic, keep better, and much easier to eat."
2002350252,511497,2018/11/27,5,"Great recipe! I have made 2 batches. The first time following the above recipe, and added some corn meal. Turned out great after soaking in coffee overnight and frying with butter. The second batch I substituted 1 cup of regular flour with a cup of stone ground whole wheat, and some corn meal. It turned out tasty and a wee bit softer. I dropped a new one into a cup of hot soup and let it soak up some broth and soften. Very tasty."
780172,503694,2013/7/18,4,This was an interesting way to prepare cauliflower. I thought the addition of the tomato juice gave the cauliflower a Greek flavor to the dish. I think that the dish might benefit from a little more spice than just garlic and parsley. Made for ZWT9
610488,503694,2013/7/21,4,"I made this for lunch today and it came out really good. I did add some more heat to it (Tabasco) and if I had thought about it, I would have added some vodka and made it a greek bloody mary served in a really tall glass with a long spoon! LOL :-)"
498271,503694,2013/7/21,4,"This is a great way to prepare cauliflower!  Nice flavor and nothing overpowering, it would make a great side dish for pretty much anything.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
1925885,510984,2014/3/7,5,"Mmmmmm!  I have a similar recipe posted but I like this one a whole lot!  Made just half a recipe for the two of us and it is the perfect amount. Just fills two tasting cups, which is enough to satisfy my sweet tooth!  Instead of processed cocoa powder, I used the organic ground cocoa that is a Costa Rican staple. It is grainier than processed cocoa, but has an amazing, natural taste. As it sat in the fridge the remaining granules softened and the pudding was a silky goodness.  Can&#039;t wait to see if DH can guess what&#039;s in this...   Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
37449,511531,2014/4/25,5,"I really enjoyed this although I did make a few changes. I toasted the ramen and added a little soy  sauce and sesame oil to the dressing. Thanks! Made for Pick a Chef event, spring 2014."
2001496259,531235,2017/4/18,5,Delicious velvet taste bud experience! Totally recommended!
2001496262,531235,2017/4/18,5,Fantastic!
2690753,493752,2013/2/12,5,I LOVE this recipe. I used olive oil instead of coconut because its what I had on hand but followed everything else and it turned out delicious! The dark sesame oil really gives it that Asian flavor. Thank you!
74904,516562,2014/10/1,5,"Thank you for posting this.  Most have milk in them.  My dogs love this recipe.  Instead of the whole wheat flour, I grind oatmeal and use oat flour.  Thank you!"
2774553,528875,2017/5/17,0,thank you so much; I have allergies to soy eggs and dairy and have been looking for a recipe like this for months. will be making it tonight! &lt;3
2442045,531003,2017/4/6,5,Fantastic!
2093752,506960,2015/9/2,2,"I just made these.  They don&#039;t taste anything like King&#039;s Hawaiian rolls.  They are so bland--needs more salt.  The texture is coarse, yet gummy.  All I had was skim milk, but I don&#039;t see how only 1/4 cup would make a difference in texture (also, the recipe did not specify one way or the other).  I&#039;m disappointed, because I am tired of wasting time and ingredients on bread recipes that don&#039;t come out right.  I followed the recipe exactly."
2000616296,506960,2015/10/28,5,"great recipe. Turned out beautiful. And your right , the additional sweetness makes it. thanks"
169430,495305,2013/3/2,5,"I made this recipe for a Sunday Dinner and it was an all around hit. I baked the lovely, fluffy, biscuits about 3/4 of the way done and them sat them into the casserole to finish. I don't care for doughy biscuit bottoms and doing it this way they still soak up the yummy liquid without being gummy. The casserole it's self is delish with a marvelous depth of flavor and it manages to he hearty and filling without being too heavy. I had to use diet Pepsi to lower the sugar content and I used 1/2 a cup of the ketchup for the same reason. The guys said that they would be very happy to have it again."
2549237,495305,2013/6/19,5,"Baby Kato, this recipe is amazing!  I made two &quot;Pies&quot; for Father&#039;s Day and won rave reviews from my husband and brother-in-law&#039;s, who really appreciated the fancier &quot;potpie&quot; as they called it.  I will definitely be saving this one for other family occasions.  Thank you for uploading!  Made for Went To The Market tag game - Spring 2013."
295324,516339,2014/9/14,0,"YUM! Made the recipe as instructed with the addition of sprinkling some cinnamon sugar on top just before baking. While it&#039;s not a &quot;pretty&quot; dish, it tastes wonderful with just the right amount of spice!"
369715,500166,2013/6/13,4,I doubled the recipe for my family but used two pounds of meat instead of 1.5 pounds. I followed the recipe except we did not use the onions and topped them with sour cream. I also didn&#039;t make the corn. We all enjoyed these.
2001524204,531470,2017/5/6,4,Really good. Love the recipe!
286566,511995,2014/3/2,5,"I scaled back for 1 serve and loved every element of the salad and the dressing, all came together beautifully and the flavours were clean and refreshing, thank you ForeverMama, made for Everyday A Holiday tag game."
226863,511995,2014/3/3,5,I loved the dressing!  Can definitely imagine using it on other salads!!  I used mozzarella pearls and just loved this salad!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game.
386585,511995,2014/3/11,5,"I don&#039;t know why, but I really wasn&#039;t expecting a lot out of this recipe, since fresh mozzarella and avocado don&#039;t have very overt flavor.  However, this was phenomenal!  The dressing is fantastic (I used the white balsamic and shallots, and I have since used it in sandwiches, salads, etc.) and the simplicity of the dish really made it sing!  I did not have red onion, so omitted that.  Beautiful presentation, too!  Thanks for sharing this sleeper keeper!"
266635,511995,2014/3/14,5,"Absolutely delish!  After seeing the photo, I knew I had to try this and boy, am I glad that I did.  Made this beautiful and delicious side to go with our dinner tonight. Definitely Company worthy -- both for taste and presentation.  Will definitely make this again! : )"
425105,511995,2015/2/10,5,"Wow. This was really great. I knew I would like the mix of mozzarella, tomato, avocado and basil, but the pesto sauce is outstanding. I actually opted for using grape tomatoes and small balls of fresh mozzarella, cut in half. I layered the salad in a small bowl and it was wonderful. The sauce would be great on a sandwich, over chicken, maybe even as the sauce on a pizza. Definitely a keeper."
486725,511995,2015/2/19,5,"Subbed goat for the cheese, and it was delicious with it. The balsamic mayo dressing is really the star here, and would be good on anything, think grilled veggie panini or steamed artichoke dipping sauce."
1620171,499373,2013/4/28,5,"This was so easy and yummy. I added some carrots, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts to make it go a little further, used chicken thigh because it was on hand. Served on Red Cargo Rice, very nice dinner. Made for Photo Tag Spring 2013."
2686575,494601,2013/2/10,5,delicious
290010,502420,2013/9/21,5,I liked this.  It is different than the rigatoni that I am used to.  The wine makes this good.
976515,512218,2014/1/18,5,Made this with my daughter. Great father - daughter time and everyone raved about the dish. grilled the chicken in an electric frypan and added a little water to the dripping for an awesome dressing! Good job KiwiCats
1803177140,518134,2014/9/28,5,Awesome ..
1803181466,529720,2017/1/16,5,"Tried this last night, everyone loved it. No fuss, no mess really just as it say's."
4740,529720,2018/1/19,4,Pretty good with a little spice. I added cheese. Yum. The cilantro really makes this soup.
2585084,498766,2013/4/21,4,"This was delicious. The butter and onion aromas made my mouth water.. My husband woofed it down.  I will make this dish again. Even though I coated the pan with butter as directed, it stuck to the pan.  I will use non stick spray and lower the temperature to 375 degrees."
400708,498766,2015/9/14,5,"Not only does the taste of this scream out flavor, but the smell in my house while it was cooking had the neighbors inviting themselves to dinner.  So good, can&#039;t wait to make it again"
199848,502558,2014/4/5,5,"Great, easy salad for warm days.  It is great on lettuce, with crackers or even in a wrap or sandwich.  I loved the addition of the chopped apples.  It&#039;s a good way to use imitation crab.  Thanx!"
2001329066,526013,2017/5/21,5,Absolutely delicious! And only 3 smartpoints.
2001898367,536464,2018/11/30,5,Made this today! Sure my brother will like it!
488441,501150,2013/6/24,4,"Nice flavors and a meal in itself. I liked the addition of cilantro and lime, and loved the mushrooms. Good luck!"
2002038979,531153,2018/4/4,3,"If I would put the chicken AND the veggies in the oven at 450 deg. the veg would be burned but the chicken would be done. Too hot and too long for the vegetables. I omitted the lemon, watermelon radishes and added parsnips, turnips, carrots. cauliflower, broccoli. I started the chicken long before the vegetables and then added the veg. under the chicken. My oven is pretty accurate as I have tested it on occasion."
128473,536726,2018/9/2,5,"Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe PotPie. It was perfection, the noodles were delicious, flavorful and had great textures. The shrimp tasted fresh and was incredible prepared this way. Made for Susie's World Tour - Australia."
169430,513378,2014/3/16,5,This made a delicious Sunday brunch. I made 2 servings and we found them to be generous but dispatched all that was on our plates anyway. One bite just kept leading to another. I think I&#039;m all set until dinner now. Thanks for another grand recipe Dee. :D
1269180,507227,2013/10/5,4,"Very easy, and nice flavours - I only used a little chilli, and used shrimp rather than prawns because my toddler prefers the slightly-less-fishy taste. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing I didn&#039;t love was the thickening the sauce with cornflour: it weighed it all down a bit for my mind. I think it would have been a lot fresher and crisper without the cornflour, and might have benefited from some finely sliced celery to keep it fresh and moist instead."
39835,507227,2014/1/28,5,Great dinner! I used shrimp also and added a basket of cherry tomatoes. Served with pineapple. Thanks for sharing!
2001075203,501733,2016/7/4,4,"Great easy recipe, but I did not know when to add the lemon verbena or the lemon slices. Is that during the extraction in vodka period? or afterward when the liqueur is strained and the sugar is added? Many thanks"
1226388,503855,2013/7/21,5,Very good.  I had this for dinner with a simple salad of sliced tomatoes and cucumbers and it hit the spot!  I think it would be good any time of the day.  I couldn&#039;t resist putting a little cheese on top so I used a combo of feta and parmesan to keep it Greek.  It did take 15 mins in my oven to get the eggs cooked the way I liked (with fully cooked whites and soft yolk)  Made for ZWT9
174096,503855,2013/7/24,5,We enjoyed this - so flavorful for just a few ingredients.  Mine also took longer to cook - the whites were still clear at 10 minutes.  I just kept watching them until they were ready a few minutes later.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9
400708,513896,2017/10/23,4,"This was very good but I found parts of the ingredients and directions a little confusing (that's probably just do to my lack of knowledge) listed 10&quot; tortillas and then 6&quot; tostadas (what's that??) then in directions says to top meat and cheese with tostado, top with sour cream, add tomatoes and lettuce then wrap?? Wouldn't that leave a mess of things NOT wrapped? Doesn't matter though, it was really good. My confusion is probably why this did not turn out as pretty as it should have - but was sure good"
47892,514152,2016/5/12,5,"I prepared this yesterday using fresh mint and parsley from my herb garden. It was delicious on a freshly steamed medley of carrots, asparagus and green beans and will be equally good on a scrambled egg for breakfast this morning! We also sampled the chimichurri on slices of sourdough bread as well! So fresh tasting! Made for First Time Tag May 2016."
243075,513489,2016/5/2,5,"This is the closest recipe to authentic Romanian sarmale that I have been able to find! My husband and I visited Romania shortly after our marriage, and I fell in love with this tasty dish. However, I neglected to obtain a recipe while we were visiting. When we arrived home I couldn't find anything that could come even close to the right taste. However this recipe has it all! I also love that it can be made in the crockpot, making it a cinch to make."
593927,500043,2013/5/8,4,"Tasty. DD1 (5 years old) loved it!!! It was a soft egg experience. I would say this is 4 servings. I used an extra free range egg because they were on the smaller side. I used organic onions and tomatoes, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and the dried mint which was neat. Made for My Food Odyssey - Afghanistan"
165933,519860,2014/12/14,5,Made this with garden fresh sprouts and squash.  We really enjoyed the flavor and the color was beautiful on the plate.  Thanks
1511187,519860,2015/4/29,5,"I didn&#039;t read directions very thoroughly and just mixed everything together and it was still delicious. I made it in the morning to be eaten for dinner but once i tasted it, I couldn&#039;t stop eating it and I ate it as part of my breakfast. I&#039;m planning to make again and follow directions this time but I really don&#039;t think it matters."
1175362,519860,2016/12/24,5,This was SO delicious! I loved that it could be prepared so easily with so few ingredients yet had such depth of flavor. It didn't require attention while I made the rest of the meal and could even be done well ahead of time and popped in the oven. Thanks -- this is just what I was looking for (and my guests were oh-so-impressed! (Don't forget the dash of sage at the end with the maple syrup.) Mmmm!
11032,510268,2014/1/13,5,"Excellent!  These have excellent flavor and are not too dense. I only added cinnamon (personal preference) and 1/2 t. vanilla.  I also replaced one cup of the flour with white whole wheat flour.  I cooked and mashed a sweet potato, it worked just fine.  I think I prefer these to &quot;regular&quot; pancakes!  My DH had never had sweet potato pancakes before and was a little skeptical, but he loved these.  We had maple syrup instead of the caramel sauce, but I&#039;ll keep the sauce in mind for other things.  Thanks Bonnie G#2, this is a keeper!"
303256,516152,2014/6/15,5,Delicious!
498271,510968,2014/1/9,4,"Great BBQ sauce!  The only small change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white.  I used plenty of red pepper flakes and love the kick that gave with the sweet and tangy flavors.  Not overly thick, served over chicken breasts and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
226863,510968,2014/1/12,4,"This was a good barbecue sauce.  I didn&#039;t mind that it wasn&#039;t thick, and loved the cider vinegar in it.  DS loved the sweetness, while I enjoyed the red pepper flakes.  Served with smoked pulled pork.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game."
37449,510968,2014/5/16,5,I used this sauce to make vegetarian sloppy joes and it worked like a charm! I did eyeball the ingredients and added less water and cooked it down to make it nice and thick. Thanks Rosie!
128473,510968,2014/8/5,5,"What a lovely recipe.  We really enjoyed this sweet spicy sauce.  It has a nice kick from the red pepper flakes and the sweetness is a nice contrast to the heat.  The sauce was quick and easy to make, easy to work with and it tasted great.  I baked chicken thighs then poured the bbq sauce over them and let them bake for 15 minutes longer.  I used your recipe #510906 along with the sauce, it made for a delicious chicken dish.  Made for Culinary Quest - Suitcase Gourmets."
526666,510968,2014/9/26,5,"I reduced this to make a lesser amount of sauce, but I was super proud of myself, as I&#039;ve never made BBQ sauce before! Brushed over some chicken legs, we scarfed this down! Thanks for sharing, rosie316!"
1751447,502563,2014/12/7,4,"I used this recipe&#039;s method (slicing the peel separately) with the Food.com Tangerine Marmalade recipe&#039;s proportions (3 lbs. of mandarins instead of 3 mandarins). I think it&#039;s gonna come out pretty good. We&#039;ll see when it cools. When you combine the techniques and proportions of these two recipes, you get a complete marmalade recipe for small, sweet citrus fruits."
1405270,512801,2014/7/20,0,the recipe isn&#039;t there
47892,517518,2014/8/8,5,This recipe has quickly become part of our Breakfast menu rotation! I switched cranberries for raisins (no reason other than I love cranberries). I like the texture of the pancakes having the cottage cheese pureed finely and will have to remember that trick for similar recipes. Used unbleached white flour subbing a little bit of whole wheat pastry flour in its place. For garnish: Recipe #404355 and a very light drizzle of warmed honey. Thanks! Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
169430,502533,2013/8/27,5,"This makes a very tasty basic meatloaf, exactly what my DH enjoy&#039;s. I did swap out the ketchup for BBQ sauce and cut back on the amount to make two mini meatloaves. 20 mins in the nu-wave and they were done perfectly without firing up the big oven and heating up the kitchen. It was a winner here."
1052873,517518,2014/9/17,5,I used gluten free flour and dried cherries. Also made for 1 so cut in 1/4. Made one big pancake. Very tasty!
286566,502533,2013/9/19,5,"I scaled back for 3 serves and adjusted the cook times to suit but still had a serve left over which will be used for a sandwich.  I put the mixed meat (I used very lean mince) into the pan (didn&#039;t worry about heating up the pan) and baked for 30 minutes and then poured off what little fat there was and then put the tomato sauce/ketchup and onion on top and returned to the oven for 10 minutes, let rest for a few minutes and then sliced and served.  We all thoroughly enjoyed this though next time I will not be quite so generous with the tomato sauce/ketchup and just smear it on as it is not one of my favourite sauces.  Thank you nochlo, made for Please Review My Recipe."
461834,502533,2013/9/30,5,"Wonderful total comfort food for me!!  This is very similar to my family&#039;s recipe, except we use soda crackers and milk instead of the panko and water and we don&#039;t cooked the onions first, but I really enjoyed the sauteed onions versus the raw.  I made this as written, but 1/2 of the amounts and it didn&#039;t state how to cut the onion, so I diced it and then sauteed it and let it cool a bit and then added this in with the meat mixture to add more flavor to the meat while baking.  We don&#039;t add any butter, so that was also new for me and I am not sure I noticed much of a difference with it in the meatloaf.  I added the ketchup, just smearing the amount we like, after the loaf cooked for awhile.  Overall a very wonderful meatloaf and total comfort meal for us!!  I served ours with baked potatoes and corn, yum!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for Holiday Tag Game."
212609,502533,2013/11/22,5,Great meatloaf.....we covered half with bbq  sauce and half with ketchup...totally delicious.... and the leftovers were every bit as good too...!!&lt;br/&gt;Another winner from your stable of recipes....thank you.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR.
128473,502533,2013/11/25,5,"This was a lovely quick and easy meatloaf to put together.  We really enjoyed this tasty dish.  It was wonderful served with mashed potatoes, green beans and cornbread.  The onions really make the dish pop.  Thanks for sharing your recipe nochlo."
305531,502533,2014/2/22,5,"Yummy meatloaf. I made 2 mini loaves and covered them with BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. The onions were delish on these. Thanks for sharing this nice winner, nochlo. Made for PRMR."
1802572180,496672,2014/3/11,4,"First time we made lobster bisque, we used leftover lobster from a meal the night before. We added more sherry than the recipe asked, about 3-4 ounces. We did not blend the bisque at the end because we wanted it chunky. It was easy to make, took about and hour and tasted just like the restaurant."
1802790458,515996,2014/6/2,5,"Years ago I stayed with some Ethiopian students in Geneva. This was their favorite meal. They spread newspapers on the floor and spread a huge pot of this yumminess on it. We ate it by taking a strip of crusty bread and scooping up a mouthful. So good. Then we&#039;d dance all evening to work it off. This Michigan got the flavor and the the rhythm of a whole new world. 38 years ago and I still love them for it: Berhane, Melaku, and my other American friend Karen."
204024,504691,2013/9/1,5,"Very nice, buttery, sweet, savory carrots. I did remove the lid and cook a little while longer to reduce the liquid to a glaze and allow some of the edges to brown slightly. Made a beautiful side that would be welcome on the table at a holiday dinner, but easy enough to do all the time."
440735,504691,2013/9/5,5,"This was a great dish!  So good, I have made it x2 in the last week.  I used fresh ginger the first time and had to use ground ginger because DH threw the fresh out.; I also increased the curry the second time because I love it. None of the ingredients overpowered each other. Save yourself some time and get the precut round carrots in the produce section.  ZWT9 Made for the Gourmet Goddesses July 2013."
2000842677,512807,2016/1/28,1,Not good it doesn&#039;t taste like PF Changs Lo Mein at all :(
2000426873,517590,2015/8/24,4,I made this with a few modifications but it was very good.  I didn&#039;t add the raisins and used all pecans and no walnuts simply because I used what I had on hand.  I would suggest making sure you divide it into two batches when you bake it.  Initially I put it all on one pan and couldn&#039;t get it to brown.  I ended up baking it twice.  Once I made a thinner layer it browned up quickly.  I baked it spread on parchment paper.  I will definitely make it again.
37449,503036,2013/12/19,4,"A lovely salad! I love coleslaw and this was nice with the apples. It was a tiny bit sweet for me, but overall delicious. Thanks!"
2000045537,503036,2015/3/6,5,"It was sweet for me, but overall delicious!!So simple and so good. this is just what I needed today! thank you and for sharing. I really appreciate this one!"
1072593,506701,2015/9/4,5,"Healthy AND economical, which makes me wish my kid&#039;s college was 5 easy payments of $19.99."
37449,508423,2013/11/12,5,"Great flavor! I used crockpot mix of beans, feta cheese, and lots of cilantro. I love the lime/sugar dressing with the cilantro. Thanks for a yummy salad. :)"
2000723987,524958,2015/12/1,5,Just finished my third one and can probably finish the plate! These are absolutely delicious ! They are crispy on the outside and the warm melty goat cheese with bacon is decadent.  Easier to make than I thought too ?
2000724252,524958,2015/12/2,5,Amazing! So delicious and the recipe was so easy to follow along with!
2198132,524958,2015/12/2,5,"Yum, love this recipe...can&#039;t beat the bacon and goat cheese combo!"
1592049,524958,2015/12/2,5,So Delicious!! Love the Flavors...YUMMERS :)
2000724316,524958,2015/12/2,5,This is a fabulous recipe. Yummy
2672297,524958,2015/12/2,5,Extremely creative and delicious!
2000724113,524958,2015/12/2,5,My wife created this and it&#039;s a keeper in the family recipe album.  Delicious!
2000724368,524958,2015/12/2,5,This was soooooo good!
2749821,524958,2015/12/2,5,Should make a great appetizer! Yummy!
2000386082,524958,2015/12/2,5,"Bacon and goat cheese, I&#039;m in! Unique meatball idea!"
2000724906,524958,2015/12/2,5,Sounds so good!  All of her recipes are DELICIOUS!  I&#039;m going to try them for a Christmas party.
128473,502696,2013/7/8,5,"Awesome coffee Annacia.  I really enjoy all the spices in this sweet treat and also doubled the amount of each of them. So good, I loved that you could taste all the different spices in this coffee, they work perfectly together. Thank you for sharing this lovely treat my friend, which I will enjoy often."
679953,502696,2013/7/13,5,"Very flavorful, and made a great start to  the morning.  DS and I really enjoyed this fantastic treat.  Left out the cardamon seeds, but the other spices blended well nicely.  Made for PRMR Tag."
37449,502696,2013/8/16,5,"Great treat! I used decaf and enjoyed all the different spices! Thanks, made by a fellow team member of Hot Stuff for the spice challenge for North Africa."
542159,502696,2013/8/18,5,"Taste as wonderful as it smells! I made this fallowing Annacia?s recommendation in the description and doubled the spice and skipped the optional sugar but did serve with Recipe #503413 which made a great pairing. As a spice and coffee lover found the complex after taste that had just a slight bite from the pepper to be entertaining, thinking I may just have to make this again in the morning. Thanks for the post."
107135,502696,2013/8/18,5,a good morning  cup of coffee zwt9
80353,502696,2013/8/22,5,Really special.  Glad I made it.
695933,502696,2013/8/22,5,"What a great way to treat myself on a warm summer morning as I am running good and late out the door to work. Back up I it is Sat. NO Work!!  I will have one more cup or two..... Very Yummy, Thank You, for the post."
227978,502696,2013/8/26,5,"Wow, what a great cup of coffee this was, Annacia.  I normally take my coffee black, but I thought the addition of hot milk and sugar (about 1 teaspoon for a 2-cup mug) was just perfect to sweeten the coffee and complement all the lovely spices in this fantastic coffee recipe.  It was a real treat to enjoy with my Recipe #504185 and English Muffins with orange butter.  Made for ZWT #9 (North Africa).  Delicious!"
107583,502696,2013/9/6,5,"Another winner, Annacia.  Great flavors and easy to do.  And thanks for the personalized press pot instructions.  :)  Made for ZWT 9."
2001321003,502696,2016/12/25,3,Three stars only because it was so strong! The amount of coffee used is the same as the cold brewed coffee that I make in my French press that is meant to be diluted. In the picture it showed a lot of milk added. Personally I would almost add half milk and/or water. Probably I will leave it in my French press overnight and use it as if it were meant to be diluted. The great thing is that it tastes exactly like my Morrocan Spiced Coffee Candle smells.... Fantastic! It was great with cinnamon raisin bread and cream cheese.
2000727748,524958,2015/12/4,5,These were so easy to make and delicious!  The crunchiness of the polenta crust pairs perfectly with the goat cheese filling.  Will definitely make a pile of them again for appetizers at my next get-together!!
2000727978,524958,2015/12/4,5,Very simple to make. Enjoy making them as well as eating them. MMM MMM Good!

400708,530314,2017/12/2,4,"We love eggs benedict in this family, but when cooking for a crowd it can be hard. This solves that issue and is so good. We even had some left over and reheated well the next day. The only change I would make and it's a personal choice is add a little more lemon juice to the hollandaise. Great recipe and fun with a crowd."
88099,507820,2014/5/5,5,"Some of the best roasted potatoes that I have ever made.  The cooking directions were perfect.  I did decrease the water, olive oil but left the lemon juice the same.  I only used 3 medium russet potatoes.  The garlic and lemon flavors were just perfect on roasted potatoes and my guest loved them even though we had stir fry with rice.  Some didn&#039;t care for rice.  Thanks so much.  I&#039;ll use this one over again and again.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
2000030692,507820,2016/12/15,5,"This is my go to recipe for crispy potatoes, easy to prepare and they disappear just as easily. I combine this recipe with another for Oven Roasted Cod with Crisp Potatoes ( ssh....from another sight ) and the results are delicious!"

653438,511013,2014/4/13,4,"Made this for Spring PAC 2014 and DH  and I like this.  I did put some sliced onions and garlic on the bottom of the crock pot then add the meat and other ingredients.  It made a lot of gravy (liquid) with the 2 cups of water and I had to thicken it up a little.  I don&#039;t know if I cut the water down and used the full amount of the packets if it would be too strong or not.  I will give it a try.  Otherwise delicious and I served the meat with steamed carrots, your recipe#345235#345235 and recipe#461460#461460."
128473,506529,2014/8/27,5,"Very nice Debbwl.  I never tried a gremolata before, it was very delicious.  I drizzled some over baked pork tenderloin, it was awesome.  I also used it as a sauce for some plain pasta.  Yum it was so good, with a little parmesan on top.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014 for my Suitcase Gourmets teammate.Thanks for sharing."
1680722,506529,2014/9/14,5,"This sauce is very tasty and strong! We just had some eggs, leftovers for dinner and this sauce made the bread pop up! Delicious and easy! Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
1198491,529324,2017/3/27,5,"Excellent! So easy and very impressive presentation and taste. I made this in about 5 mins, threw together the suggested dipping sauce without even measuring and this was as good as tuna in the restaurants minus the cost. Our favorite way to eat ahi. Thanks!"
1633565,535321,2018/10/3,5,"LOVE this recipe! The only changes I made was to lightly salt the chicken before dredging in flour, using dill instead of bread and butter pickles, and adding a little mayo to the buns when assembling. Makes a lot of slaw so I repurposed it by adding a little lime juice, cilantro and garlic salt and added it to a cilantro lime chicken salad that I made. It was delicious!"
480195,503644,2013/8/28,5,This recipe results in a very flavorful and moist fish. I used cod and followed the recipe as given.   The sauce is absolutely delicious. We all enjoyed the dish and I will certainly make it again and again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
1803222343,518961,2014/10/12,5,Thanks Broke Guy for creating this Soyracha (tm) Hot Chili Soy Sauce Maple Bacon recipe! I tried it early this morning. The sweet of the maple syrup and the hot of the Soyracha sauce made for a unique flavor. Really good.
1800230938,522945,2016/10/28,0,Thanks for such an awesome recipe! The latkes were very delicious.

2000220819,498790,2015/5/23,5,"These were so good! The only things I did different was use OreIda crinkle cut fries and baked as directed, and used 1 cup shard cheddar and 1 cup mild cheddar instead of all sharp cheddar. They turned out so good! I will definitely be making them again."
2001434271,494215,2017/3/14,5,Just put all the ingredients in the bread machine and set it to be done by 9:00am tomorrow morning (it's 10pm now). Nothing like freshly baked &amp; warm bread in the morning topped off with Kerry Gold Irish butter! Thanks for posting the recipe!
386585,499069,2014/5/5,5,"As simple as this sounds, it really ends up being very flavorful!  I couldn&#039;t find 1.25 lb. package of ground turkey, only 1 lb.  I kept the seasoning amount the same, though.  Since my lemon pepper contained salt, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I served these with some wonderful cucumber spread, which was like tzatsiki sauce (Recipe #146991) and a delicious Greek salad.  I will definitely make enjoying this again!

679953,507950,2013/11/10,5,"Other than using regular bacon, made this as written, and used cheddar cheese.  The dressing really gives some great flavor, we all Enjoyed.. Made for PRMR."
1098582,505358,2013/10/14,5,"AWESOME!!  I would not make this recipe without fresh tomatoes, but a trip to the farmer&#039;s market gave me the tomates to make this.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I bought frozen pie crust by mistake and to add to it, I only had a 10&quot; pie pan.  This led to no pretty crust, but the flavors were still perfect!   Exactly what I wanted!"
126440,505358,2013/10/24,5,Wonderful pie.  I made this using tomatoes and basil from the garden.  Wow loved it.  Will use less cream cheese next time but will make again soon.
2000958334,503909,2016/4/5,3,"I followed this recipe for the ingredients; used 4 cups of flour.  It still needed additional water to have the correct consistency in the bread machine on the dough cycle.  It needed more time to rise.  It needed more time to bake.  It turned out after baking it for an extra 5 minutes past the maximum stated time a barely discernable brown color, however the cheese was golden and browned, the bread was chewy and somewhat bitter in flavor.  I think I will, afterall, stick with my usual Italian bread recipe that I will make garlic spread to butter it with afterward.  Were I to make this bread again, I would leave out the herbs; they add a flavor that throws off the cheesy garlic flavor, I&#039;d add a couple Tablespoons of honey, and add a Tablespoon of softened butter (so it would have olive oil and butter in equal amounts to make it a bit tenderer)  Do be sure to stretch the dough without kneading.  And finally, to get the bread to brown more beautifully, brush milk over it just before baking."
2000707974,524789,2015/11/24,5,It was the greatest meal I have ever had. The bacon inside goes great with the sauce and chicken. I also liked the feta cheese inside it. All together it was the greatest meal of my life so far. It was really easy to make and didn&#039;t take all night either. If I could rate it 100 stars I would.
2000726400,524789,2015/12/3,5,Such a great recipe. A hit with the whole family.
2000733018,524789,2015/12/7,5,"Very splendid recipe, i really enjoyed it. You guys should try it!!!"
2000733027,524789,2015/12/7,5,"Good recipe , love the taste !!"
47892,507950,2013/11/20,5,Yum! I used your Recipe #422858 recipe and a homemade Thousand Island.  Snuck in a few lettuce leaves as this was our main dish accompanied by homemade applesauce! Good sandwich and will make again! Prepared for Veg Tag/November.
1287956,515787,2014/5/14,4,"I have several pounds of ground almonds to use up, so I thought I&#039;d give this a try.  It just doesn&#039;t become a pancake easily, but it IS good to just scoop up after it&#039;s been cooked and put some honey or jelly on it.  The next batch, I may even stir it in some plain yogurt."
107135,503656,2013/7/24,5,this was very good i made it with rice and pine nuts zwt9 rattsa fratsa stars
2002157743,520809,2018/5/19,0,there is a type-o in the recipe
2002159501,520809,2018/5/20,0,Was not good! It was not a very well written recipe! It was dry and the mouse was bad. I do not recommend this recipe
611302,506106,2013/10/4,3,"I really liked the concept of a pizza dip.  I would suggest cutting down  on the sour cream and I really wasn&#039;t sold on the taste of the homemade sauce, but this dip would be really good with your favorite store bought pizza sauce.  I skipped the bacon due to my families preference. I made this with regular sour cream and regular cream cheese because that is what I had on hand. My family won&#039;t go low fat yet.   I made this for My-3-Chefs."
1803759207,520575,2015/4/4,5,"We made these cupcakes for my son&#039;s 5th birthday party and they were a huge hit!! My son especially loved them and he&#039;s a really picky eater. We didn&#039;t ice all of them because they are also delicious as muffins! We are seriously addicted to them, they are so good! I love having them on hand because my son will eat all of his dinner and do his chores to get one! :)"
107583,493638,2013/7/9,5,"Great combination!  Loved the bit of tartness the cranberries give this.  I am going to add some nuts next time, too."
679953,499487,2013/5/11,5,"This made for a very nice dinner.  I used the Hot Italian Sausage,  omitted the salt, and added a teaspoon chili powder.  Overall taste presentation, and flavors were good, and it does make an excellent alternative to stuffed peppers.  I would think any meat would work very well in this.  Had 4 thumbs up.  Tagged and made for Ingredient Tag."
107135,502803,2013/7/26,5,now i didnt make this in the microwave cause it was just as fast stovetop. these were easy and filling and very good zwt9 another winner mikekey
136997,499514,2013/8/2,5,"Couldn&#039;t be any simpler. The only thing I did differently was, to braise it in my dutch oven in a low 325 oven for 3 hours. I don&#039;t really like the results of a slow cooker. No offense to Melissa&#039;s method though. My choice of liquid was chicken stock. :)"
632249,499514,2014/6/13,4,"This wasn&#039;t as flavourful as the crockpot recipe I normally use, but it was still good.  I think it just lacked some spices. I will try it again and just add a some thyme or bay leaves. Thanks for posting."
227978,498564,2013/8/19,5,"This is positively heavenly, Linky.  We all really enjoyed this great asparagus dish.  It had such a wonderful Asian touch and the garlic salt gave it a nice finish.  I will make this often, especially when fresh asparagus is in abundance at the local farmer&#039;s market.   Made for ZWT #9 (SE Asia)."
107583,498564,2013/8/26,5,"Very easy and very tasty.  I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, because I felt the soy would be salty enough.  Made for ZWT 9."
37449,498564,2013/8/27,5,"I loved this and instead of saving some for my son, ate it all up myself. My bad."
780172,498564,2013/8/28,5,"Simple to make, great Asian taste. I did not add garlic salt, used fresh garlic instead. Made for ZWT9."
1680722,498564,2015/4/13,5,"Enjoyable light vegetables side dish, to delicious to be only a side dish. I roasted the asparagus under the broiler for about 12 minutes as the asparagus were quite long but thin! I loved the chopped garlic on it very much!

We eat this with chicken cooked in the oven and white rice!"
1060667,498564,2016/2/15,4,I think that all the ingredient&#039;s (besides  the asparagus) needs to be mixed together and then poured over the asparagus then tossed around.  Delicious after coming out of the oven...great along side a good Chinese/Asian dish for sure!!
47892,498564,2016/7/18,3,I used one teaspoon regular sesame oil and replaced the olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil. I don't understand the use of garlic salt when both soy sauce and garlic are also included in the ingredient's list so I skipped the garlic salt. *Fresh* ginger in place of ground-significantly fresher taste! Roasted for 15 minutes-but roasting time really depends on the thickness of the stalks. Prepared for CQ 2016.
1925885,498564,2016/7/19,5,"Great recipe for asparagus! Like other reviewers, I thought the garlic salt would be overboard, so I used garlic powder. Glad I did because it was definitely salty enough! We will definitely be making these again! Thanks for posting. Made for CQ3, Team Pi Rho Maniacs."
266635,498564,2016/7/27,5,"We really enjoyed this Asian-flavored asparagus. It really complimented our meal tonight. I used thinner asparagus, so I reduced the heat and lessened the roasting time. Will definitely make them again."
135470,503382,2013/9/2,3,"These were ok, I wished for more apple and a little more spice ( I cut the recipe I half but used the full amount of spices) but enjoy the flavor overall. I used chopped cranberries and the walnuts which both added nice taste. The thing I found a bit off putting is they are kind of squishy in the middle. I cooked them extra and the muffin cup wasn&#039;t over full so I know they weren&#039;t undercooked. They didn&#039;t rise a lot so I wonder if they have too much moisture maybe they don&#039;t need the butter and the applesauce would provide enough moisture on its own? Made for ZWT 9 Family Picks by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers."
67728,522874,2015/8/8,5,"Used this to make Recipe#522880 to use in Baby Kato&#039;s Tekka Don (Easy Tuna Bowl) on Just A Pinch. Very easy to make, tasty, and I especially like that I don&#039;t have to dig a hole in my overstuffed fridge to store it. Thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest 2 Japan"
226867,532736,2017/7/20,5,"I used a mug instead, but hey, same difference, right? Also, used cinnamon on the whipped cream b/c it contrasted better. Who am I kidding, I forgot that it said powdered sugar and just blithely sprinkled on the cinnamon!"
227978,532736,2017/7/24,5,"Coffee, chocolate, whipped cream.....what's not to like about this drink. It was so easy to toss together, too. I'll have to remember this one for those scorching hot days when I need something cold and delicious. Thanks, momaphet. We loved this one! Made for Culinary Quest 2017 (Austria)."
128473,532736,2017/7/26,5,"Awesome coffee Momaphet. I enjoyed it very much. Nice strong coffee, chocolate, whipped cream and icing sugar, I am in heaven. Thanks so much for sharing this lovely coffee recipe. made for CQ4 - Austria."
92006,532736,2017/8/2,5,Yum! I used a nice homemade vanilla ice cream to go with it. Made for CQ '17.
690623,532736,2017/8/3,5,This was absolutely delicious!!! I think I want one every single day. Made for CQ4
865936,512297,2014/5/26,5,"Delicious!  I just added some snow peas because we like vegetables, otherwise made as written."
2001885257,515357,2017/12/24,5,I made this for our family Christmas dinner today and it was a big hit! Very easy to make and delicious. I'll definitely be making it again!
2001982483,515357,2018/2/15,4,Served it to a group of 12 - had many compliments! I’ll make it again.
1620171,498604,2013/4/20,5,"This was wonderful. Directions were simple to follow and portions were spot on. I did find that I needed longer to cook my chicken than suggested, but I suspect that just comes down to size of the breast. We will definitely enjoy this again. Made for Phototag Spring."
128473,517576,2014/8/12,5,"Wow, Lynn these were fantastic.  Even the picky dh enjoyed them.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  I put all the meat on two skewers and all the vegetables on two skewers so that they would cook more evenly, it worked perfectly.  Loved this recipe, thank you so much for sharing. I will be making these again.  Made for Culinary Quest - Southern USA for the Suitcase Gourmets."
482376,496598,2013/3/28,5,Wonderful salmon! I love the marinade mixture - especially the orange marmalade and brown sugar elements. I was cooking for two so I halved the recipe and also shortened the cooking time in half and it worked out really well. This recipe is quick and delicious. Thanks! Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef.
865936,504851,2013/8/1,4,"This is a nice combination of flavors.  Gandules are sort of earthy, but the coconut helped balance them out."
37449,504851,2013/8/7,4,I enjoyed this with the oregano and cilantro and the garlic.  I enjoyed the rice cooked in coconut milk. I left out the chicken bouillion to make this vegetarian. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by one of team Hot Stuff.
1706426,502807,2013/7/8,5,"We loved this! I had a small amount of buttermilk, a small amount of heavy cream and a small amount of 1 % milk, so they all went into the mix. It worked perfectly! I chose chives as my flavor, yum!"
160977,502807,2013/8/16,5,"Just like I remember from childhood. This was easy to make and I made a ball of the cheesecloth and let it hang to drain overnight. When I opened the ball the cheese seemed a little blubbery and I thought I would drain it some more when it had chilled. But-when chilled it had turned to a spreadable creamy white cheese, just perfect, no need to drain at all. I divided the cheese and added different flavours to the parts. Chives, jam, red pepper where my choices this time. Thanks for posting."
266635,517412,2014/10/4,5,"It&#039;s been sooo long since I have made a salmon spread.  This is a great recipe and I had it for lunch today along with some hummus.  We&#039;ll be having it again tomorrow while watching football - thank goodness that it makes quite a bit.  The only changes I made was to increase the liquid smoke and dill a bit and I added a touch of cayenne and garlic powder.  Served this spread with some organic black bean tortilla chips and of course, some crackers.  Made for the Football Tag, Week 4."
280271,517412,2015/11/22,5,Made this to take to a football gathering...hubby and I had to give it a taste before presenting it...I found it a bit salty while he thought it was just perfect...very easy to prepare...made for &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; tag game...
2001019921,517412,2016/5/21,5,"Made this for book club (halved the recipe) and it was a hit! I substituted Almond Milk for Milk and red onion for green onion (but only added about 1 teaspoon) , and added some lemon zest and white pepper. I purchased smoked salmon so I did not need to add the Hickory flavoring. Absolutely fabulous!"
65502,503410,2013/7/18,5,This recipe is SO good! I was making Recipe #503664 and Recipe #503663 and needed a veggie for the side. This recipe has few ingredients and was ready in no time. I halved the recipe and there was enough stuffing for 4 medium tomatoes. Made for the Tasty Testers for ZWT9. Thanks lazyme! :)
482376,503860,2013/7/18,5,What a great flavor combination! This is an excellent recipe. I didn&#039;t think I would ever actually love cabbage (always just liked it) until this recipe. The combination is just perfect. Thank you! Made for ZWT9 by Soup-A-Stars
1745502,503860,2013/7/22,5,Both DH and I liked this very much. Make sure to add enough salt to handle both the rice and the cabbage. It was an easy dish to make and was a nice change. Plus I could do all sorts of fun things with the leftovers.
2172608,503860,2014/1/7,5,"Cooked this for dinner tonight.  I was a bit skeptical, but I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I added leftover rotisserie chicken and sriracha.  YUM!  Will be great for lunch tomorrow."
266635,513641,2014/3/9,4,"We really enjoyed this quiche; especially the fact that it doesn&#039;t need a crust (trying to reduce gluten in our diet). The quiche turned out perfectly and it really makes a great presentation dish.  Made as directed using all ingredients listed; however, I do think it could use some additional spices to bring out the flavor more. Perhaps some additional Mexican spices would be a good idea. Will definitely make this dish again.  Made for PRMR, March, 2014."
386585,513641,2014/3/24,4,"Being on a low-carb diet, I was really anxious to try this recipe.  I found the Muenster cheese unusual for a Southwestern recipe, but it was a nice change of pace.  This is a good make-ahead recipe that reheats well.  I was able to have this all week for breakfast!  Thanks for sharing."
1925885,504576,2013/8/11,5,"Simply easy, simply delicious!  Used orange bitters, which gave it a nice color.  Very, very yummy!  Thanks for posting!"
1388322,520488,2018/10/5,5,"I made this soup on the cook-top. It is delicious! The Italian sausage gives it a unique flavor; 1/2 pound is plenty. For the salsa, I used the 12 oz jar of Salsa Autentica from Trader Joe's. Trader Joe's also has cans of organic garbanzo beans. I did add 2 stalks of celery when I added the parsley. Also, instead of just spinach, I used a mixture of spinach, kale, and swiss chard (the organic power greens from Costco). I recommend using a pound of greens. I will add this soup to my permanent repertoire of soups. Thanks Charlyn W."
2384579,526265,2017/7/11,2,"The very major plus of this recipe: it was delicious! Main problem: it is entirely incomplete without spices. None are listed in the ingredient list, and they are absolutely essential to this dish. The step-by-step directions call for a spice mixture sold by the author of this recipe, but as food.com is nonprofit, it looks like the spice mix was deleted from the ingredient list, but unfortunately not replaced with substitutes. This should be rectified. And - news flash! - you don't need a special spice blend at all, just some standards that a well-stocked spice cabinet would already have on hand (i.e., cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, cumin). I didn't notice the spice mix anomaly until halfway through the recipe, when I had to look up other recipes, figure out the spices, and then add them in at appropriate intervals which was totally confusing. Problem #2: I think there's a mistake in the quantity of rice. SEVEN cups of basmati rice?!? That's like 21 cups of cooked rice. Unfortunately on brainless autopilot I actually soaked 7 cups of rice, cooked less than half of it, still had food for more like 15 people, and ended up throwing the rest away because after all what does one do with an entire bin of wet rice? Anyway, this is a good recipe but the spices are imperative and you only need about 1/3 that much rice. Think it through, use your head, and triangulate with other recipes."
251917,495335,2013/6/26,5,"Aussie Swap #77: WOWZERS!! This BBQ sauce is outstanding!! Made in advance and let sit overnight so the flavors would meld together!! Amazing, full of flavor and juicy chicken!!"

2688922,495108,2013/2/11,5,Was looking for something different for dinner last night and found this recipe.  WOW!  It turned out great and I already have requests to make it again.  It's a keeper!
2324285,510550,2014/4/10,5,"I liked this.  The dish reminded me of the meals my Polish parents would make years ago to use up ingredients.  This is definitely satisfying comfort food.  I used turkey kelibasa, which I believe is reduced-fat as well, and served everything over quinoa.  It was a filling and tasty meal."
724631,505190,2013/9/28,5,"Robust flavor, worth the effort!  Made with Recipe#505191 for a weeknight meal.  The entire soup recipe fit in my Vitamix for easy mixing.  Very tasty and comforting.  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
914360,495108,2013/2/23,5,Your are officially MY GYRO :0)  The sauce is amazing !
174096,495324,2013/3/2,5,"I used 8 drumsticks and cooked for 2 hours before adding the peppers.  The meat was very juicy and tender and the sauce flavorful.  For some reason, the sauce didn't thicken up too much for me, but I took the intro suggestion to serve over rice, which was a great choice for soaking up the sauce so we could fully enjoy it.  We especially enjoyed the touch of rubbing the drumsticks with 5-Spice Powder.  Thanks, and good luck!"
128473,495324,2013/3/2,5,"We really enjoyed this lovely asian inspired dish.  So many wonderful flavor and great textures.  It was delicious served with party mashed potatoes.  I made this exactly as written except that I used orange peppers instead of red, I was out of the red. I also didn't use the slurry, (personal preference only). This dish smelled so intoxicating while it was cooking.  It was perfectly spiced and seasoned.  I was afraid the 5 spice might be over powering but it was perfection.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Gread use of contest ingredients, good luck in the contest."
2708447,495108,2013/2/24,5,Sounds delicious.
2709356,495108,2013/2/24,5,"Wow, this is the most imaginative use of Ranch I have ever seen. This is amazingly good...Wow!"
80353,505685,2013/8/31,5,"Made this to serve as a drizzle over larb - super easy to do and very tasty.  The recipe calls for pineapple twice, but I think it must mean only once?  Any way, I used 1/4 cup measure of pineapple chunks and it was lovely."
2708004,495108,2013/2/24,5,"My family loves Greek food, so I decided to give this a try.  Boy, am I ever glad I did.  What a great combination of flavors.  Will definitely make again."
2711846,495108,2013/2/25,0,Yum!  Tried this last night and everyone LOVED it!
2193374,495108,2013/2/26,5,I love this combination!  Sounds very nice!

679953,508349,2014/4/3,5,"I found this to be  a very unique recipe. Left out the grape tomatoes though.  Very flavorful, and the caulilflower was cooked perfectly.  The seasoning was above and beyond. A definite repeater. :)"
425105,504137,2017/3/13,5,"I absolutely LOVED this dish. What wonderful flavor. It's similar to Jewish noodle kugel with the sour cream and cottage cheese and eggs, but the onion and caraway seed really makes this dish shine. Do not leave out the these ingredients...they totally make the dish. I don't like celery, so I left it out and doubled the onion. I also think there weren't quite enough noodles...I had a hard time covering the dish in each layer. Next time I would go with 12 oz of noodles. And I would keep an eye on it...mine was done about 10 minutes early and the noodles were crisping up and the cheese was browning, so I went ahead and pulled it out. Definitely an all star...going in my Best of 2017 file!"
2001960543,535786,2018/6/22,5,Fantastic
80353,503988,2013/7/18,5,"A cross between a mustard and a spicy mayonnaise.  I made this to use in a variety of recipes for the tour, but can see myself using it in other, not creole-inspired recipes."
452355,503988,2013/9/5,5,This is a great creole mustard sauce.  It&#039;s extremely easy to make and was very flavorful.  I plan to use it on my sandwich for lunch this week.  I served atop Recipe #503852 and this was a perfect condiment.  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT9.
247911,520919,2015/12/25,5,"A small Christmas Eve miracle. Carrot cake without gluten or fat! Baking today for tomorrow&#039;s dinner, I tried Baker Kelli&#039;s recipe for carrot cake, to offer a sweet ending to guests who must avoid wheat or much fat for health reasons. I used powdered sugar instead of icing it; the icing (butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar &amp; chopped pecans--not exactly low fat) will be served on the side. Also baked a smaller &quot;trial&quot; cake to taste tonight. Eureka, it worked! Note: Instead of xanthan gum, I used &quot;ThickenThin not/Starch thickener&quot;, which contains xanthan and other gums; added it with the flour, baking soda."
2000561559,533903,2018/1/12,5,"Initially I thought this might be too hot (it was for me!), but our guests absolutely loved it! The comment I heard most was that they couldn’t stop eating it. This recipe makes a lot of dip, which is a good thing, because it disappears quickly!"
2002263818,533903,2018/9/2,5,GREAT! I used fresh roasted hatch chilies and added a pinch hot sauce. Really yummy!

2399085,499488,2013/10/3,5,We made this last night. It was great. Made a great side next to our Salisbury steak!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks. Made for your football win!
488441,499488,2013/10/3,5,"Beautiful recipe. I loved the wine, Parmesan and carrot juice. I made the mistake of trying to drink the healthy juice. It&#039;s pretty terrible on its own. In the recipe, it&#039;s great. Made for football pool."
865936,499488,2013/10/24,4,I loved the flavor of this rice!  The sweetness of the carrot and onions was a nice contrast.  I used long grain basmati rice which did not get &quot;creamy.&quot;  Next time I would stick with regular rice or the arborio to get a creamy texture.  Made for Football Tag.
67728,495990,2014/5/4,5,"This was really good on thick pork cutlets that I grilled on my Cuisinart indoor grill. Spicy with a hint of sweet. Super easy to throw together, too, since it&#039;s all ingredients that are basic pantry staples (well, at least in my pantry they are, lol). I was originally intending to use this on some turkey burgers, but after tasting it on the pork, I&#039;m thinking it might have overpowered the turkey burgers. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be using this again during the summer, since I&#039;m betting that outdoor grilling would make the flavor of this rub even better. Thanks for posting!

2925840,493484,2013/8/1,4,"I followed everything but ... used raw Florida peanuts in shell, fresh off the field and have found this recipe easy, delicious. They were ready in 3-4 hours and are wonderful! Thanks for the recipe."
128473,507101,2014/5/7,5,"These were lovely pancakes, light, tender and fluffy.  Quick and easy to make with excellent results.  I enjoyed them tremendously.  I did have to make a change however, I was out of chocolate chips so I used what I had in the house....white chocolate chips.  The white chocolate worked perfectly in the pancakes, not too sweet, they allowed the pancake  to shine.  Thank you for sharing your recipe. Made for Spring Pac 2014."
2001135068,507101,2016/8/20,5,I used this to make waffles bc I didn't read the recipe name and they were the best!
2002242475,535907,2018/8/8,5,i just love non veg
2002242483,535907,2018/8/8,5,good for dinner...
1680722,504284,2014/11/27,5,"This is one of my favorites ways of cooking and the Maroccan cuisine is one of my favorites.&lt;br/&gt;This dish is phantastic, I never cooked with kumquats and this was a great discovery for me.&lt;br/&gt;The sour taste of the citrus had been very well balanced by the honey! Thanks the slow cooking the sauce got lightly thick and it was a pleasure to enjoy it with bulgur (substitution form couscou).&lt;br/&gt;I will make this again for sure and I really recommend this delicous dish even for special guests.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for posting this delicious recipe!"
169430,504284,2018/10/27,5,"Wonderful recipe that I'll certainly be coming back to. My single change was to use 2 small mandarin oranges as I don't think I've ever seen kumquats here in Canada, at least not where I live. Must say that I love the use of saffron here to me it's the quintessential element that put's this over the top. Used a smaller size Israeli couscous and it came out perfectly. I'll make this the next time that I have dinner guests. Thanks so much for a major keeper!"
1803370695,519542,2014/11/19,5,"A wonderful combination of flavors! Made this to see how it would turn out, as I wanted to serve it on Thanksgiving. It was delicious and my family loved it! I made it with the peach flavored schnapps, but I bet it would also be good with the peach nectar as suggested. This dish will be on the menu in my family for the holidays."
1803370730,519542,2014/11/19,5,"This sweet potato casserole is a winner! I made it with the peach nectar, doubled the pecan topping and added miniature marshmallows over the top. Excellent! Going to try it with the peach schnapps the next time I make it."
1803375116,519542,2014/11/20,5,"Outstanding! I used the peach schnapps, tripled the pecan topping (I like lots of pecans on my sweet potato casserole). I pureed the canned peaches in a blender and mixed them in, instead of chopping them up. Came out great. It you don&#039;t have a blender or food processor you could probably substitute the canned peaches with peach baby food to get the same results. I live in Texas, and we love our sweet potato casserole here. This is one of the best I&#039;ve ever had."
2001717156,523058,2017/9/16,5,Just what I was looking for! A zucchini muffin with protein powder. I didn't have chocolate protein powder but used plain vegan powder and upped the cocoa and sugar. I had extra zucchini so just threw that in too. They turned out great texture and flavorful but I will reduce the protein powder a bit next time as it gave it a bit of an off taste. My tweaks certainly didn't affect the great ratios and excellent muffin recipe.
2000355578,533571,2018/2/6,0,Well liked at Super Bowl party. Only made 1 subtle change.
2001537431,512815,2017/5/26,5,"I've never made gingersnaps before Wednesday.... These are yummy...and again I've had friends ask me to make them again. The cayenne pepper adds a perfect kick of heat at the back...wonderful. I made a second batch using butter and crisco as I did nt have enough crisco...still yummy. A little softer but who's complaining :) Easy, fast, a tasty bite....enjoy"
286566,505316,2013/8/29,4,"I made a full batch of the butter and added more garlic and still would have liked more but then I am a garlic fanatic though only used half as I was only serving 3 of us and due to tastes I had to use a mild cheddar instead of parmesan cheese and I did taste the butter before spreading and loved it but I feel that it may be better to omit wrapping in the aluminium foil and baking as my end result was that the bread was rather dry from the second baking to brown the cheese (maybe the grill/broiler would be the better way to go as it wouldn&#039;t cook the bread so much).  Will definitely be using the other half of the butter (in the freezer at this point) which I think a slice over a steak would be superb.  Thank you Sharon123, made for Please Review My Recipe."
482376,509255,2014/12/2,5,"Holy croutons! The croutons were fabulous. I halved the recipe and kind of wish I would have made the full batch. They are crispy and full of flavor. I cooked mine about twice as long as stated because I like crispiness. The salad was a great way to use up my leftover turkey and cranberries. I loved the dressing, too. Thank you!"
2648579,493848,2013/1/21,5,"Made this for a BBQ with friends and family.  Everyone raved that it was the best salsa they had ever tasted.At one point everyone had stopped socializing and were all around the bowl digging in! My husband actually asked that I not use my old recipe anymore and stick to this one. It was fresh, tasty, easy to make and healthy. Really a perfect salsa."
1801888066,493848,2014/1/5,5,"Must to my surprise this salsa is very fresh considering it&#039;s canned products. One of my children had a &#039;project&#039; due .. She had to find something that was made in Caribbean Cuisine. Thanks to her teacher they found this recipe. I was surprised to the flavor of it after it was finished. She took the salsa to school with her to share with her class mates in that class. And came home with a empty bowl .. and two bag&#039;s of empty chips. Apparently the teenager&#039;s agree that this is indeed delicious. I myself, being a type 2 diabetic played with the recipe at home (I just HAD to make some for home). I reduced the amount of sugar and added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of black pepper, 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/2 tsp of some fresh dill and the juice of half a lime. Needless to say the other children in the home completely finished off a bowl and chips as well. I am going to add this to my &#039;go to&#039; recipe&#039;s for salsa/dips for any kind of function!"
2000919548,493848,2016/3/14,0,this resipie is amazing
2000725281,524990,2015/12/2,5,We love shrimp and the lemon is a welcome change to the cheese sauce.
2001656615,510933,2017/8/4,5,Amazing! Perfect recipe and followed every step. Wouldn't change a thing!
2000726400,524936,2015/12/3,5,Great recipe. Easy to make and fun to eat.
2001227204,527221,2016/11/4,5,"Super Ribs!!!!!! put some small white potatoes in with the ribs and cook all at the same time, gives the potatoes a super flavor"
573772,499315,2013/7/13,5,I really liked these! I made part exactly as written with coconut and they were better than I thought they would be. I made the rest without coconut and added about 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were even better.
1803270456,499315,2014/10/26,0,"I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t mean to be insulting but this was terrible. I&#039;m not one that typically posts reviews, so please know that the only reason for my post is to spare others from wasting their ingredients on this recipe, like I unfortunately did :("
1803570264,499315,2014/12/27,5,"My 5 year old and 2 year old ate 3 of these their first round...I think I put more like 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  These do not have any added sugar, so they don&#039;t taste sugary like most desserts.  Which is why I will feed my small children 3 each!  Healthier AND good!"
1803665870,499315,2015/1/16,5,"These cookies turned out delicious! My family and I are used to eating a healthy diet, and avoid eating foods containing sugar as much as possible. I am very grateful for this recipe post. I made these cookies twice already, and my husband and our three children loved it too.  Both times mixed about 1/3 to1/2 cup chocolate chips in the dough. Since dessert is an occassional thing in our home I am happy to enjoy them even more with chockolate chips. I can imagine raisins or dried cranberry would go well with it too. Thank you very much for posting."
760494,499315,2015/1/21,1,"I agree with the other reviewer who said these cookies were terrible.  They were bland.  I mean, they had all the subtle flavors from the ingredients, but overall, they tasted like lumps of bland oats.  Nothing stood out.  I do feel like I wasted my ingredients."
2000146204,499315,2015/4/17,5,My favorite cookie recipe. I change it a bit; instead of applesauce I use non-hydrogenated margerine. Sometimes I add nuts or some cocoa powder. I love these healthier cookies!
2000252586,499315,2015/6/6,0,"These are great but don&#039;t expect them to be a sugary treat. They&#039;re good if you want a treat but are following a healthy, low fat diet."
2000334725,499315,2015/7/12,4,"I liked these cookies. I am trying to eat healthier with exercise. These don&#039;t taste sweet, but they satisfy the need for a snack/treat. I think considering that there is no flour, or extra added sweatness, they are great. I might even add chocolate chips next time."
2001021013,499315,2016/5/22,1,"The ingredients may be healthy but just because you bake a concoction in a circle doesn't make it a cookie. It's really soft, I even cooked another 4 minutes to see if I could firm them up. They should be called baked oatmeal. There is nothing wrong with baked oatmeal, it is just not what I was aiming for"
2001134029,499315,2016/8/19,5,"I used natural super chunky peanut butter with honey to add sweetness, left out the extract because I didn't have any, left out the coconut because coconut is gross!, and these cookies turned out delicious. I usually screw up when I cook, so this very easy recipe was great!"
2001184329,499315,2016/9/26,4,"These were great. I am not sure what all the bad reviews are about, they are supposed to be a healthy version of a cookie, not a cookie. I added raisins and 1/2 tsp of baking powder and pumpkin seeds. Perfect mid-morning snack to curb sugar cravings."
2001209634,499315,2016/10/17,4,Ignore the bad reviews! This is a great healthy alternative. I did leave out the coconut and instead I added a very small amount of mini dark chocolate chips. Everyone loved them! I would recommend cooking them just a little longer.
2001352066,499315,2017/1/15,4,"Made these last night since I was having a sugar craving, but have been trying to eat healthier. Shockingly, I did not have vanilla (or coconut), so I substituted with 1/2 tsp. chocolate and 1/2 tsp. coconut flavorings. I felt it needed a little something more... like butterscotch morsels. :) I added 4 per cookie when I pulled them out of the oven. I really liked them and my toddler did too!"
2001358926,499315,2017/1/20,5,"Ok, I almost didn't make this recipe because of all the haters leaving poor reviews. I have to say that ya'll might be trippin or at the very least, overestimating your ability to craft a good batch of cookies. Cookies (which by definition these are) are both an art and a science. You gotta come at these bad boys with passion as well as precision. I will make these again. They're very healthy and I only tweaked it slightly this time by adding 1/4 cup of agave, because the haters scared me into thinking the cookies wouldn't taste sweet at all, but they were plenty sweet and actually could be less sweet. The haters are probably the people who go to Starbucks to get &quot;coffee&quot; and leave with 3 cups of sugary syrup and milk wherein which coffee cannot be tasted. I didn't add coconut but I will try that on another batch too, probably the one I leave out the agave on."
2001381363,499315,2017/2/6,1,I don't like these. I followed the recipe except I didn't use coconut flakes. They are bland. No flavor. I love the healthy banana oatmeal cookies so much more than these. I will stick to the other recipe.
2001415798,499315,2017/3/3,5,I loved these! They are delicious especially with the coconut. They are a great healthy snack or dessert. I highly recommend them and may try them with raisins or almonds next time. 5 Stars!
2001481811,499315,2017/4/11,5,I didnt have applesauce so I used coconut oil instead. I doubled the recipe. These are DELICIOUS!! My kids literally ate half of them before I was done baking the last tray! SOOO GOOD and SO healthy!!!
2001497969,499315,2017/4/19,5,These are so delicious and easy to make. I used Maple extract instead of Vanilla. Yummy! Perhaps the people that didn't think these were sweet enough weren't using ripened enough banana's. I will definitely be making these again!
2001525193,499315,2017/5/7,5,"Love these cookies. I must admit I added chocolate, and in the second batch even cranberries, which made it even better. But the taste is sweet enough for my European taste. I always adjust American recipes because they are way to sweet for me. Keep up the good work. (Sorry for the poor photo quality, but my phone is not a very good camera)"
2001918099,499315,2018/1/7,5,"Just made these and they turned out perfect! The pictured batch has raisins, but tried dried cranberries and they were also really good. I also used an all-natural PB. I like that these used all-natural sugar (applesauce and over-ripe bananas) and they came out very tasty and not too sweet. This is a perfect mid-afternoon snack or for refuelling post work-out, they are small but I found them filling. As you can see in the picture mine held their shape during baking. Highly recommend &amp; will definitely bake these again!"
2001931583,499315,2018/1/14,5,"I love this recipe. It has real ingredients and these cookies taste great without any added sugar. I did add some cocoa as I was wanting chocolate. I also left out the vanilla because I didn't have any. This was the second time I made this recipe and the first time, my coconut pieces were too large, so this time I used the foot processor to grind the coconut and part of the oats and mix in all the dry ingredients. I poured that in a bowl with the rest of the oats, then blended my bananas and peanut butter together in the food processor. Thank you for a great versatile recipe with no flour."
2001919065,499315,2018/3/17,4,Added raisins and a little honey. They turned out really tasty. You can’t expect them to have the texture of flour based cookies but things like raisins and nuts help.
2002143471,499315,2018/5/6,4,"For a healthy cookie alternative, these are yummy. I didn't care of the apple taste with it, so I may attempt them without the applesauce next time (maybe an egg?). These are more like oat clusters, not really traditional oatmeal cookies. I added mini chocolate chips instead of coconut. very good!"
2002172019,499315,2018/6/1,5,"I enjoyed making these cookies. They were easy to make and nothing in the recipe really needs to be cooked. So that added toasty oven texture is nice. I am going to add fresh diced apples and a nut mixture next time. For all those complaining about the lack of sweetness, add a little bit of stevia!! I really think any dried fruit would also jazz up the flavor level for those complaining about the blandness. This recipe is lovely because it is YOUR cookie. It is so easy to personalize! I also made them nice and large (only 12!). Relax and enjoy this healthy recipe!"
2002188803,499315,2018/6/17,0,"I HAVEN'T TRIED THESES YET BUT BY READING THE INGRED. FOR IT I THINK THIS WILL BE REALLY GOOD AND IT WILL BE THE 1ST ONE OF THE PB BAN. OATMEAL RECIPES THAT I TRY. IF THEY COME OUT AS WELL AS I THINK ; I WILL DELETE THE OTHERS , I COPIED. THANKS FOR PUTTING THIS ON HERE. K. KNOTTS"
2000302327,499315,2018/9/29,5,I am going to try this recipe today. I will come back later with my review on these cookies. They look tasty. When I make my cookies I do not add the salt. Since I am trying to cut down on the salt. I was going to try frozen cherries in them too. I hope they come out good.
1803608860,499875,2015/1/4,5,This recipe is foolproof. I absolutely love it.
2000150188,499875,2015/4/18,2,Where are the pickled sour grapes?
769890,507780,2014/1/25,5,"Awesome way to get all apple in!  I made crock pot applesauce &amp; used the peel for this...wanting to encorporate them into my granola... But they are gone, so I&#039;ll have to make again!"
511037,507780,2014/10/17,2,I used Granny Smith apple peels and followed the directions exactly.  The resulting peels were nice and crispy but very bitter.  What a disappointment!
482376,519467,2015/7/20,5,I&#039;m honored to be the first review for this gem of an appetizer recipe. It&#039;s delicious and so very easy to make. You can (and I did) use the less expensive canned crab from the grocery aisle for this recipe with great results. Everyone loved it! Thank you!
1802668061,519467,2017/12/30,5,"My mom used to make this for NYE every year, it was so good and I was pleasantly surprised at how simple it was to make! Super delicious a fan favorite and I will be making this again for Super Bowl Sunday!!"
610488,505794,2013/8/20,5,"After figuring out I had chosen two banana dessert recipes to review for ZWT 9, I decided to have a banana dessert party.  &lt;LOL&gt; With the tempura mixture holding everything closed, I had no problems during the frying of the spring rolls while I had a few minor mishaps with the other recipe I was reviewing. After the first rolls were made, I started adding either a glob of liquid fudge or a thin layer of mashed pineapple on the wrapper before adding the banana and wrapping. Much more interesting but oh so hot. Lost some skin off the roof of my mouth due to the burning heat."
62264,497049,2014/1/25,5,"Doubled recipe and tripled sauce - sooooo glad I did! What a delightful recipe for our 20 degree night last night! Served with fluffy Basmati rice after a starter bowl of hot &amp; sour soup. Guess I was feeling the need for black vinegar. I&#039;m using the sauce for pork and beef meatballs to take to a surprise birthday party tomorrow - crockpot deliciousness. Would do the pork again (I used country style ribs, aka sliced shoulder) but I figure meatballs are generally easier to eat. Anyway, thanks for a perfectly balanced recipe that handles expansion with aplomb."
599450,497745,2013/8/1,5,"Everyone just loved this salad. Made as directed with sun-dried tomato vinaigrette dressing because that&#039;s what I had on hand. This would be perfect for a potluck lunch. I was even asked to enter this in my office&#039;s salad contest in September! We&#039;ll see. Thanks, threeovens! Made for Aussie-Kiwi Recipe Swap #78."
574936,531438,2017/6/18,5,Excellent taste. I chose to use bacon grease. If you are smoking meats it makes sense to prepare them in the smoker instead of using the oven. I had to use other type of potato as russets are not available where I live
43321539,531608,2018/7/7,4,"The problem I encountered was the garlic and basil will burn, even at medium heat. Next time I'll only cook the garlic for 30 seconds or so and then add the filets. Also, be careful of the cooking temperature. Medium heat, tops. Otherwise, a delicious recipe"
107135,503745,2013/7/22,5,Wonderful pizza recipe for a hot summer day!  The Tzatiki sauce is very cooling and the veggies bump up the dietary value.
447487,503745,2013/7/23,5,"Made this wonderful pizza recipe for hubby and I tonight. I&#039;m gluten intolerant so used locally made pizza crusts that are gluten and dairy free, Greek goat&#039;s yogurt and ground chicken &amp; lamb for the meat. We both can&#039;t rave over this enough. It was a lovely meal after a long work day and very easy to make. Thank you so much strawberrybird for a recipe that will be used again and again in our home :). Made during ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers!"
865936,502821,2013/8/24,5,"This was incredibly delicious!  I made my own nuoc cham using chile paste, fish sauce, sugar, lime juice and water.  It had flavor, but was quite watery. So glad I had leftover shrimp and rice!"
482376,506141,2014/4/10,5,"Easy and excellent salad! I loved the flavor of the lemon juice, balsamic and olive oil combination (although, I had to pour some out of the finished product becasue I had too much). The salad ingredients are perfect together, too. I used red onion, but kept all the other ingredients as listed. I&#039;m putting this recipe into my best-of-the-best file! I used this as a dinner side, but would also love it as a lunch. Yum! Made for the Spring Pick-A-Chef event in the Contest and Events forum."

2001430002,535581,2018/5/10,0,"this is written terribly, you have left out a lot of information. you did not tell how much or what kind of fish, or even list the baking soda. this a very difficult recipe to follow."
2001827809,531147,2017/11/27,1,"In my opinion cornstarch isn’t necessary for creamy scrambled eggs. I didn’t like the gummy doughy texture it gave them. A tablespoon or two of heavy cream and an extra yolk, well seasoned, and then you just simply don’t over cook them and they come out very light and creamy."
133174,513959,2014/5/17,4,"This was nice for a change of pace.  Probably wouldn&#039;t call it &quot;creamy&quot;.  I may try cooking it again with the milk in place of the water.  I used almond milk, fresh blueberries and chia seeds.  The quinoa cooked for 12 minutes then rested for another 3 to 4 covered before serving.  It was drizzled lightly with honey.  As written this recipe makes 4 adult size portions.  For the 2 of us I halved the recipes."
2001128739,531147,2018/1/15,1,"I had the best scrambled eggs I had ever eaten this past year at a restaurant in Detroit (and they were part of a brunch buffet). I asked the chef that made them. He said the technique was to only use eggs...no milk, no additives. Put them on a very hot pan, griddle, etc for just a short time...1 minute, then turn the heat off and gently turn them until cooked through. I find it works perfectly. You can spice them up afterwards however you like them. I don't tend to salt and pepper in the pan and let the &quot;eaters' do it to their preference. I would serve herbs separately too. I did the try the above recipe though and it was nothing compared to what the chef taught me. (oh, he did use butter in the pan, melted before adding eggs)"
2001056557,536229,2018/7/31,5,Super yummy! Creamy and great flavor!
239758,504331,2013/9/15,4,"After I bought some beautiful fish fillets on special, I was pleased to find I had everything on hand to make this recipe. Such an easy-to-make and flavourful dish. The heat from the chillies was perfect. We like a lot of zing, so in future I&#039;d add some crushed ginger and lime juice to the marinade. Thanks so much for posting."
2549237,499090,2013/5/5,4,"These are really good, super easy to make and spicy but not too spicy.  Thank you for an easy alternative to a regular fatty hamburger.  Made for New Kids on the Block Game."
227978,505015,2014/4/22,5,"This was so delicious and refreshing, ninyai.  My husband and I really enjoyed these for a quick morning snack.  I liked this from the start because it called for milk (instead of yogurt, which I&#039;m all out of at the moment), so I was able to make a smoothie with what I had on hand.  Made for the Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef event."
227652,505015,2014/5/17,5,"Made this for my husband; smoothies are quite expensive &amp; it&#039;s a wonderful thing to make at home for so much cheaper! I used fresh strawberries (frozen are so expensive!), 1/2 of a ripe banana (not frozen, either), skim milk &amp; Splenda for the sugar. Whipped it up in no time &amp; it was much enjoyed. Thanks so much!!!"
498271,504441,2013/8/22,5,"This is a great quick and easy fried rice!  I used less shrimp than called for; I had peas, zucchini, and red bell pepper on hand so that&#039;s what I used for the veggies.  Loved the lime in the sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
133174,504441,2014/2/6,5,This makes a quick and tasty lunch or dinner.  I made 2 servings reducing the rice to 2 cups and using leftover steamed black rice.  I added in both a grated carrot and some frozen peas.  Probably used a little over 1 cup medium size shrimp and the full amount of sauce.  The cilantro was added after cooking and then additional sprinkled over as garnish.  I think this would be great with fresh Thai Basil in place of the cilantro.  Made for Aussie swap.
227978,504441,2016/8/2,5,"Excellent! We really loved the wonderful flavors in this fried rice dish. I opted for the grated carrot, but this would be just as wonderful with peas as well. The stir-fry sauce added a lovely tang. As written, it's enough for a pretty filling main dish. But I would also consider halving the recipe, chopping the shrimp, and serving it as a side dish. But as written, it's definitely a &quot;keeper&quot; recipe. Thanks for sharing your recipe, LifeIsGood. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 (Thailand/Indonesia)."
128473,504441,2016/8/11,5,"Wow, what a great recipe. This shrimp fried rice was amazing. Quick and easy to make with terrific results. Hot and spicy, full of flavor. I used both the carrot and the peas. Thanks for sharing LIG. Made for CQ3 - Thailand &amp; Indonesia."
2001834705,534635,2017/12/13,5,I think it is great that we have a recipe for Chanukah.
1973434,536226,2018/10/1,4,"Fantastic, made it in an instapot. Very flavorful and full of goodness. Did not use the flour to make this Paleo. Even better the next day. Freezes beautifully."
2201427,497137,2013/3/22,5,"What an awesome combination of 5 ingredients!  Great flavors, here!"
914360,497137,2013/3/22,5,"Boy, this has t be good with these flavors !  FIVE stars !!!"
2680727,497137,2013/3/24,5,What a great combination.
1359842,497137,2013/3/24,0,A winner recipe Ronna!
2216338,497137,2013/3/24,5,"potatoes, cherries &amp; chicken...a great combination"
1592049,497137,2013/3/24,5,SO Delicious!! Full of Fantastic Flavors..YUM :-)
88099,505737,2013/9/1,5,This is a great recipe.  I&#039;ve been wanting to try Kale as a side dish and I&#039;m so glad that I picked this one.  I didn&#039;t have shallots so used red onion but other than that I made as directed.  A lot like spinach but with a lot milder flavor that we enjoyed so much more. The bacon is wonderful in this.  I added a little fresh lemon juice to mine but DH liked as is.  This only served the two of us.  I feel sorry for the other two that didn&#039;t get any.  I&#039;ll made this again for sure.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for New Kids tag game.
165933,520442,2015/1/9,0,This was a nice change from the usual steamed broccoli.  I added a clove of minced garlic and thinly sliced mushrooms.  Thanks.
2414156,497137,2013/3/24,5,"Wow, the cherries really give this a touch of sweet bright flavor!"
227978,502520,2015/1/2,5,"This was a wonderful way to prepare green beans.  We all enjoyed this recipe.  Thanks, lazyme."
480195,503052,2013/9/6,5,Very refreshing drink for a 100+ degree day. These were just perfect! Thanks for sharing the recipe.
610488,503052,2013/9/7,5,Real quick to make when you have the ingredients on hand!! Yum!!
1791046,493007,2014/1/25,3,"I love crock pot recipes.  I didn&#039;t use the horseradish, and maybe that would have added a little more zing to this recipe."
724631,515373,2014/4/30,5,"Simple and delightful, made DH&#039;s day!  I&#039;m the picky lima bean eater, and this seasoning and gentle oil bath made these lima beans quite mellow.  I agree that quality extra virgin olive oil makes a difference in this recipe. We&#039;ll definitely make these again!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
37449,514681,2014/6/2,5,This was very different but I really enjoyed it! The lemon juice and herbs took this up a notch. Loved it with the peas! Thanks!
1745502,513879,2014/8/10,4,"When it says only use 1/4 cup in your sandwich, believe it. It tastes so rich. Leftovers are good served all sorts of other ways, in grilled cheese, on open faced sandwiches with tomato, etc. I think that the pickle juice is the secret weapon in these, so don&#039;t leave it out. Easy to make and very festive looking."
204024,513879,2014/8/12,5,"Really loved making this and trying it.  Total memories of holidays of my youth,  my mom always had celery sticks with pimento cheese.  The flavor and texture of this recipe is great.  Made for Culinary Quest."
131126,513879,2014/8/13,5,Pimento cheese is a favorite here. This creamy version hit the spot for lunch.  New to me was adding pickle juice.  We served in pitas as suggested and with fresh fruit.  Made for the Culinary Quest 2014.
2561974,497639,2014/7/27,5,"I varied the proportion of brussel-to-broccoli based on what I had around, and added bacon. This was easy to make and was a great twist on the oil-salt-pepper simple roasted sprouts. The sauce complements the vegetables well, and my kids liked it."
266635,495597,2013/7/3,4,"This is a very tasty onion soup - liked the idea of adding the balsamic vinegar.  I did; however, add a touch of brown sugar to balance the flavors of the vinegar and wine.  I used some smoked gruyere as that is what I had on hand. This soup will make a great lunch today.  Made for PRMR, July, 2013."
2002331796,499127,2018/11/14,0,"This is a great recipe! I tripled it and added lots of leftovers. If I had any aspirations of uploading a picture, it was squashed by the fact that the pan was empty before I could blink! This will definitely be my go to recipe too from now on. Thanks a lot and bless you for sharing it."
1269921,500196,2013/6/12,5,I always cook my cauli-rice this way.  I keep it in the fridge for recipes throughout the week or freeze in smaller portions for later use.  It&#039;s unbelievably good!
2000408562,508642,2015/8/17,0,"Thank you for this quick and easy receipe. 
I halved the sugar and added cinnamon and flaked almonds on top. 
Spectacular!
Because I have a fan-forced oven, I only baked it for 40mins and it was delicious! 
This will become one of my staples."
2000669433,524495,2015/11/24,5,"Great to prep ahead, and have ready for those late work nights."
2000488168,524675,2015/11/17,5,"Amazing flavor! I never had anything like this before....never tried Polenta before, but my husband and I LOVED this recipe. The goat cheese and sausage really give this recipe a comforting Italian vibe. Wonderful!"
2000694706,524675,2015/11/19,5,Made this for the family and loved the flavors. And it was so easy to make.
114317,523552,2016/6/13,5,A delightful variant of the old classic Bisquick recipe.
852554,494205,2013/4/7,4,These are good but I would make them without the maldon on top next time.  Found that it make it a little too salty since the beans stll had salt even with rinsing.  Great for low carb chocolate cravings!  Made for PAC Spring &#039;13
1764844,526051,2016/3/7,4,"My husband and I both really liked this recipe. I think the next time I make this, I&#039;ll add some diced jalapeno.

Note: I used two 10-oz cans of whole green chilies which yielded a total of 10 chilies. Also, I found that an 8 oz bag of cheese was plenty."
80353,504270,2013/8/22,5,Really yummy.  The family loved the addition of dukkah which really lifted the lowly carrot.
1186987,512773,2016/9/15,4,"Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!! It was loved by all!! The flavour deserves 5 stars but I took one off because of the measurements for the marinade are way too much (at least double what is needed) and the coleslaw can easily be doubled. Next time I will make 1/3 - 1/2 of the marinade and double the coleslaw. Also, I missed the fresh lime."
2001503726,512773,2017/4/23,5,Thank you so much for this.. we have been working on this for some time. The Asian toasted sesame dressing was not the taste we were looking for however in our travels to find that taste I believe we have come close. I purchased LeeKumKee Plum Sauce at Wal-Mart in the Asian sauce area.... Im telling you this is as close as anything. it has a slight hint of the ginger and the sweet contrast is &quot;IT&quot;..... and we have tried soooooooo many. Just a suggestion and thanks again...... the combo of all the sauces is wonderful.
2001905726,512773,2018/1/1,4,This was good but needed tweaks to really taste like Applebee's. It wasn't sweet enough so I added about 2-3 tablespoons of white sugar and a teaspoon of peanut butter for that distinct Asian flavor. It also needs lime juice. After the tweaks it was perfect!
2000633075,512773,2018/4/11,5,Really enjoyed this. I found pre-made won ton strips at the store and made this as a salad. Not quite Applebees taste but good.
2001835702,530140,2017/12/2,0,How long after it comes out of the oven do you remove the pan?
39835,497740,2013/3/25,5,"These are good! Changes I made was skipping the lemongrass and the chili peppers. I used green curry sauce instead of the one mentioned (half a jar or so in the fridge, so didn&#039;t measure) and used the crockpot option for the entire recipe. Instead of rice we served with mixed vegetables. An easy dinner that was very good! Thanks for sharing!"
2549237,497740,2013/5/1,4,"This was a very simple recipe.  I followed the browning the meatballs method and cooked on HIGH for 3 hours.  My kids really liked these meatballs.  My husband was not a fan, but he doesn&#039;t like curry much.  We all thought it was fairly reminiscent of a stuffed mushroom.  Thank you for the recipe duonyte!  Made for 2013 Zaar Cookbook Tag."
2324285,497740,2014/4/18,5,"These were some tasty meatballs.  To brown them , I baked them in the oven at 450F for 15 minutes.  You have to wash an extra dish, but this is quicker than waiting for them to set up in the slow cooker.  Some other changes: I used lean ground beef, and added two kaffir lime leaves and some palm sugar to the sauce.  I know I will be making this again, for sure."
126440,498991,2014/5/15,4,Very good for a light dinner.  Made my own sweet potato waffle fries but they didn&#039;t get crispy so have to try again.  Otherwise was very tasty.
498271,505053,2014/1/1,4,Fun and tasty way to serve zucchini!  I don&#039;t care for raw onion so used a little more zucchini and some onion powder.  We enjoyed them as-is but I think they would be great dipped in ranch dressing as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
829250,505053,2014/1/17,2,"My daughter and I didn&#039;t think these were so great. My husband liked them. I didn&#039;t put onion. I used a little chopped up green onion and two garlic cloves. No paprika! And a little more than 1 cup zucchini. Barely got 24 mini cups. I tasted the bread crumbs a lot. I think if you used more zucchini, say 2 1/2 cups they would be better. Mine burned a little and they were done at 17 minutes. I think they should be full to the top of the tray. Maybe it wouldn&#039;t taste so much like bread crumbs and they wouldn&#039;t have cooked so fast. They do look like the fried zucchinis from Carls JR but they certainly didn&#039;t taste like them."
1058097,517596,2014/8/4,5,"We really enjoyed this.  I halved the chili powder because my son doesn&#039;t like much heat.  It has just the right amount of sweetness.  We had it on chicken breasts, but I think it would be even better on pork.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting!"
1052873,517596,2014/8/9,5,"Used on rabbit legs. Baked at 300 degrees 90 minutes, covered in foil, then broiled a few minutes. Very good. Made for CQ 14."
865936,517596,2014/8/10,5,I made this twice.  First I used a hot chile powder that is so hot I can&#039;t stand it.  It was too hot.  Then I made it with ancho chile powder.  Much more reasonable.  This rub was good on both chicken thighs and flanken cut beef short ribs on the grill.  CQ
227978,517596,2015/1/23,5,"This was a delicious rub, Lavender Lynn.  I used it with pork chops, and they were really good.  Some in my family don&#039;t like much &quot;heat&quot;, so I reduced the cayenne and chili powder quite a bit, and it still packed a nice punch.  The combo of seasonings is wonderful together though, whether you like it hot or not.  Made for the Best of 2014 tag game."
128473,517596,2015/1/25,5,"Thank you for sharing this lovely spice rub LL.  It is wonderful, hot, spicy and full of flavor. I made it exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  I used it on chicken breasts with great results.  Made for Best of 2014 Tag Game."
280271,517596,2015/2/1,5,We loved this...it has just the right amount of heat...I used it on chicken breast...this time...so next time I may use it on pork...I cut the recipe in half and it filled a nice spice jar full...thanks for posting it...made of Best of 2014...tag game...
400708,530300,2017/7/2,5,"This was so easy and so impressive, served to guest we had over and so much easier than trying to make individual rolls, mixed the dough the night before, left to rise in fridge, then rolled out and put together in the morning. Served with fresh fruit, PERFECT"
2001475022,530300,2018/2/23,5,This is a great beginners recipe. And so tasty. I also let the dough rise overnight and baked it the next day. Yummy!!
80353,503003,2013/7/14,5,Delicious - like a greek puttanesca (minus the anchovies).  So simple to make and so tasty!
145352,503003,2013/7/17,5,This was very good and so easy!!!!! Was a perfect side dish to our Greek meal!! Made for ZWT 9.
216999,503003,2013/7/20,5,Really tasty combination of flavors and easy to prepare.  The family loved it!  Another for the favorites file!  Made for Pink Panthers on the Prowl for ZWT9.
296809,503003,2013/7/22,5,"Made for ZWT-9 &amp; recommended by Goddess Captain (evelyn/athens), this was perfect to accompany our baked cod dinner tonight. I esp like easy-fix recipes that combine starch &amp; veggie elements as side-dishes. This could hardly be easier to make &amp; would work very well w/spinach or broccoli added to the mix. I made just 1 minor chg &amp; added a generous tbsp. of cream cheese to give it a lightly-creamed texture. We loved it! Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
323186,503003,2013/7/24,5,"Easy and very good,  lovely when you have no time but want a good meal.    Made for ZWT9, Panthers On The Prowl, thank you Lynn!"
133174,503003,2014/4/16,5,"Easy and packed with flavor!  The tomatoes were seeded and diced romas.  Kalamata Olives are a must have for the dish.  After the pasta was cooked I added real Italian olive oil to the pan and lightly sauteed the garlic.  The drained pasta was added back in, tossed and remaining ingredients tossed in and combined.  I can see myself making this wonderful dish again.  Made for Aussie Swap."
266635,503003,2016/8/14,5,"This spaghetti was so delicious -- loved the fresh tomatoes, olives and of course the feta cheese. It might have needed a touch more olive oil and garlic, but this dish was delicious all the same. Will definitely make this recipe again. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 - Greece"
895132,503003,2016/8/20,5,"We both said &quot;five stars&quot; after the first bite. What else can I say? I followed the recipe to the letter, using gluten free spaghetti. Thanks so much for sharing! Made for Culinary Quest 2016 / Greece for team IH?"
486725,503003,2016/9/21,5,"Served this as our main dish and it was well enjoyed. For our tastes I halved the oil and used a lot of fresh parsley. This is chock full of goodies (high &quot;sauce&quot; to pasta ratio). Even though we really liked this as is, I think next time I would add less cheese."
1802386576,498995,2014/3/6,4,"Easy, less calories, and my daughter (13 yrs.) loves it.  It will be my go-to recipe."
2002324124,498995,2018/11/7,5,"Delicious! I like that it is lower in calories than those with the higher fat content and that the lemon gives it a nice flavor. I like the consistency of this recipe, too. Not too soupy and you can scoop it up with any cracker, chip of veggie. This recipe will go right into my favorites!"
2893053,502923,2013/7/7,4,"Made it just as written, and it was great! A bit of heat, sweet, and tad bit of saltiness. Easy recipe, great for those late night cravings!"
174096,502923,2013/9/4,5,This is delicious!  The sweet and spicy combo is wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9
2597942,502923,2013/12/10,4,"I made a batch of this for the Monday night football game. The recipe is very easy to follow. The only change I made was that I had to use Kosher salt (I couldn&#039;t find my sea salt in the cupboard). It was salty, sweet and spicey. I was half tempted to up the cayenne pepper amount, but I didn&#039;t and I&#039;m glad... 1/4 teaspoon is plenty. I think when I make this again using the cayenne, I will also try one batch without it. Thank you for posting. (Made for Football Pool week 14 win)"
780172,502923,2013/12/20,4,"This is popcorn with a kick, actually I think there is a little too much pepper, will make it with less the next time. It is a nice change from regular popcorn."
305531,502923,2013/12/30,5,This is a nice football snack! I made this for us while watching a game and my popcorn-loving grand daughter loved it. Will definitely make again as it was such a hit. Thanks twissis for a nice keeper. Congrats on your Week 14 Football Win.
2000478722,521678,2015/9/16,4,"This is a pretty simple ice cream recipe and isn&#039;t difficult to make at all. There aren&#039;t a large number of ingredients, so I had everything I needed to make it on hand already. 

The texture is wonderful and oh my goodness is it CHOCOLATE!!! This is a very rich and creamy ice cream, so you will probably only be able to devour a scoop or two before you call it quits. My only complaint for the amount of chocolate is that it&#039;s hard to find the wonderful hazelnut flavor that nutella has when you pair it with so much chocolate.

The other thing I wasn&#039;t fond of is that it&#039;s VERY very sweet. I would probably use half of the sugar that&#039;s recommended, or use unsweetened chocolate instead of bittersweet. 

All in all, this is a wonderful chocolate ice cream."
2689619,495481,2013/2/13,0,Wow!  So easy yet sooo good.  Just in time for Easter dinner planning.  Thanks!
45027729,535829,2018/8/10,4,Easier method (I think)
2001827760,535829,2018/9/6,0,"I think I will try this in my mini Bundt pans. I don;t care about the candy outside ( too sweet &amp; too much work) but love the ideas of a pina colada flavored cake. Pineapple, coconut, rum, oh my. Seems this would be much easier, as well."
2001992125,530650,2018/4/17,5,"This was really, really delicious."
908175,506710,2013/9/15,5,"WOW is right! I could not stop eating it. Although I assume just as good without, I added chicken. I cooked the chicken in the oil for 5 min, then added the onion and garlic. I also omitted the red pepper flakes. Thanks for posting. This one is a keeper."
145352,506710,2014/1/7,5,Yum!!! This is great! I added some pasta water at the end to thin it a little. Great meatless meal!!
2198531,507069,2013/11/17,0,"Since moving away from the tri-state area, I haven&#039;t had disco fries.  I&#039;m so happy to have a recipe for them now!  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!"
1802766547,507069,2014/7/9,2,"I was born and raised in New Jersey and never heard of Disco Fries before! So, my guess is that they are a North Jersey thing, kind of like Taylor Ham, because I&#039;ve never seen them in South Jersey. Gravy fries and cheese fries I first saw out west. And, cheese fries can be had in every pizzeria, but gravy AND cheese??? NEVER!"
1802911548,507069,2014/7/9,0,"Really - the Garden State and home of all kinds of delicious local and ethnic food and NJ gets disco fries - made of all fake, pre-processed ingredients??!!!   Are you freaking kidding me?  We&#039;ve all heard of french fries with brown gravy and cheese sauce, but have never heard this called disco fries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kristine, you should be ashamed of yourself."
1800134515,507069,2015/7/9,3,"I wish we could cut NJ in half and north jersey can keep their high car insrance, Yankees, and disco fries to themselves. For 62 years I have never heard of these disco fries because the people of south Jersey affiliate themselves with the garden states abundance of tomatoes, asparagus, sweet peaches, sweet corn, etc."
2000400347,507069,2015/8/13,5,Still delicious though!
2000943999,507069,2016/5/31,2,"This must be a new thing for my homestate of New Jersey! I'll bet someone brought this down from Canada, since they brag about this recipe all the time. Honestly, although I live in Delaware, I KNOW that New Jersey can do much better than this!"
2001077041,507069,2016/7/5,0,Seriously? Who submitted Disco Fries for NJ? I have lived in NJ for all of my 61 years and never heard of Disco Fries. NJ is known for its Pork Roll Sandwich and diners. Disco Fries?? Never!
2000708513,507069,2016/8/23,3,"I was born, raised and still reside in the lovely Garden State. To all the reviewers who exclaimed, &quot;I've NEVER heard of 'Disco Fries'!&quot; Well, let me tell ya... There's another ENTIRE universe out there, full of stuff you've never heard of!&quot; Disco fries have been around for ages, you mainly find them at diners as most diners in NJ are 24 hours and after a night of partying (3 AM), everyone goes to the diner to soak up that alcohol. Hence the name &quot;Disco Fries&quot;. Some places use an American cheese sauce, while others use real cheese, such as Mozzarella. So for those folks who didn't know Disco Fries exists... There's a bunch of other $hit you've never heard of. LOL! PS. ***For Bonnie K &amp; Wendy V***, I meant to click your reviews were UNHELPFUL. Just because you've never heard of something, doesn't make it real. &amp; I wish we could split NJ in half too. So you ignorant, toothless, rednecks can be separate as well! Good day. :D"
2000696720,507069,2017/4/29,1,"Artificial cheese, artificial gravy and frozen fries? Just as horrible as you'd imagine it to be."
2000952477,506710,2016/4/1,4,"We love this recipe, we actually added ground Italian sausage to it and it taste so delicious! we add it with the diced tomatoes step. mmmmm good!"
1179525,507069,2017/6/26,2,SO - these are very similar to POUTINE from Quebec. They are very popular in northern Maine as well due to the close proximity with the Canadian French border. Though we make them with homemade beef gravy and cheese curds or homemade cheese sauce. It was the processed gravy and cheese that brought this one down for me.
2001668629,507069,2017/8/12,0,"I don't know how these got to being called disco fries. It's poutine, a French-Canadian dish that's been around a long time."
2001601815,507069,2017/8/13,0,I wonder if you could use 2 packages of cream cheese (I would use the Green Mountain Farms lite Greek yogurt/cream cheese blend) and a 12-oz jar of fat-free beef or chicken or turkey gravy (haven't seen 10-oz. jars of gravy...12-oz. jars would probably be the closest I could get. And if Alexia still makes those 98% fat-free fries I could use those. For those of us looking for a lighter and healthier version of this snack/side dish. And I do agree that perhaps they should've called it &quot;Lazy Poutine&quot; instead LOL.
2000916506,507069,2017/8/18,0,"Sorry, I tried it but I much prefer poutine especially considering this Disco variant is using cheese sauce + gravy sauce hence ending with not much texture difference. I recommend at least real cheese. Not Cheez Whiz sauce."
2000985833,507069,2017/8/19,1,"Come on Cheese wiz? Processed Gravy? What's wrong with your heart and digestive system? Made with chemically processed cheese, look at what the ingredients are used for. There are a number of real cheese alternatives that are a lot healthier."
2001673516,507069,2017/8/19,0,I would never eat it Much better stuff like jersey tomatoes
2001177113,507069,2017/8/20,0,"We have poutine in Canada, fries with cheese curds and beef gravy mmmm so good. I think I'll stick to our poutine, disco fries sounds too processed."
2001922263,507069,2018/1/9,4,Good
2002057652,507069,2018/6/26,1,Disco fries are made with mozzarella and gravy...not cheez whiz
6753164,507069,2018/7/18,0,Come on... is this REALLY the best New Jersey dish you could come up with?? What about Jersey corn and tomatoes...the best I've ever had!
2281516,505713,2017/6/11,5,"Made these just as instructed except baked for 50minutes. They were very soft, may back off to 45 minutes next time. My husband loved them. There was a little carmalization on some from the honey which he loved. Hubby has never eaten cooked beets.... he now wants me to make them for Thanksgiving. Great recipe!"
425105,505713,2017/12/26,4,"I love cooked beets and recently discovered that yellow beets taste about the same, but aren't nearly as messy when peeling. So I made this recipe with fresh yellow beets (3) and used dried thyme as it's winter and that's all I have. The only other change I made was I mixed up the sauce before I peeled the beets, and as I cut them up I tossed them into the bowl and mixed it all up before putting in the parchment paper rather than pouring the sauce over the beets. I doubt that made a difference, and the result was very tasty. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the lemon overpowered the beet flavor, and I love beets so I would cut back the lemon by half next time. If you like lemon or beets, you should give this a try. Made in memory of Sharon."
107583,506726,2014/4/29,4,"This turned out extremely moist.  I would like more ginger flavor, though, so will add more next time.  The ingredient list is missing flour and I sent a message to the chef.  I guessed and used 1 3/4 cup.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
2001017266,520788,2016/5/18,4,This recipe is the closest copy cat that I have found one small change I would hold off on adding salt until it's almost the desired consistency I found it slightly too salty. I used 85% lean ground beef and Heinz Ketchup. It definitely satisfied my Hot Dog Shoppe without driving across country
550557,504462,2014/9/16,1,"Being on a diet I had high hopes for this but to me it tasted like bitter chocolate water. That being said, I think you could change this out some and I plan to experiment. The ice cubes should be omitted and perhaps increase the almond milk and banana or add Greek yogurt to thicken. Maybe add a tsp of artificial sweetener as well."
67728,495987,2014/4/23,5,"Definitely a keeper! I was initially skeptical that the egg mixture would be enough to properly bind all the veggies in it, but it baked up perfectly. I used reduced fat cheese because that&#039;s what I accidentally picked up at the store, but next time I will probably use full-fat cheese for better texture (reduced fat cheese wasn&#039;t too bad, but texture was a bit rubbery -- my fault, not the recipe&#039;s). I only got 4 servings out of this, not 9 -- maybe it would serve 9 as small pieces on a breakfast buffet with other items. I actually enjoyed this warm as breakfast, and then another piece at room temp for dinner. Very good both ways. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1179225,495987,2014/5/2,4,"Delicious! I added some chopped green onion and a tiny bit of cayenne to the egg mixture. For some reason I needed to baked this for an additional 15 mins and it still didn&#039;t set up completely firm, but it tasted great. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
198238,518430,2014/9/21,2,"I was really excited to try these, but they were just too dry. Maybe the butter shouldn&#039;t be melted?  Creaming the butter and sugars might have helped them hold together better, but using melted butter made the dough really crumbly. I added an extra egg to try to hold it together. Still had to pack them hard to get the ball shape. As cookies, the taste was good, but not a &quot;wow&quot; and not surprisingly, they tended to fall apart."
523073,497772,2013/12/31,5,"A holiday staple.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for posting the recipe!   Sometimes I don&#039;t use butter... and as is the custom in our family, I don&#039;t actually measure.  Many decades ago Nana (my memere) made these with the leftover Toutiere (&quot;toot-care&quot;) pie dough.  There was always plenty of dough -- she probably planned ahead.&lt;br/&gt;I made the meat pies for 2 cousins, one from each side of the family.  I included Nun&#039;s Farts in with the pie for the only cousin  who shared Nana.  She said they brought tears to her eyes as she hadn&#039;t had them since her Mum&#039;s passing decades ago.  She never knew them by that name (perhaps her Mum had more class.)  I asked other people -- and not one person had ever heard that name!  I was relieved to find there was someone out there who had and it wasn&#039;t something I inadvertently called them in restitution for parochial school education.&lt;br/&gt;More power to you for keeping the tradition and name alive.&lt;br/&gt;Bonne ann&eacute;e!"
37449,507258,2013/10/13,5,"I quartered the recipe, used whole wheat macaroni and homemade oat milk. Much enjoyed!"
386585,502885,2016/8/7,5,"This was delicious and so easy to make. I decided to use it on a pound of large shrimp and there was definitely plenty left over. I made this in my blender, and the aroma was really like a mojito (despite the shallots)! I will definitely be making this again. Made for Culinary Quest 2016"
305531,512833,2018/6/15,5,Yummy dish. I The sauce was great but then how could it not be with mushrooms and onions. lol. Thanks for sharing Kate.
80353,503441,2013/8/26,3,"Sorry, we just didn&#039;t care for this salad very much.  The hoisin just tasted off on the watermelon.  We all tasted, but did not finish.  On the plus side, the mint and peanuts were good additions."
2001767386,533699,2017/10/26,0,"These were a big hit. I ended up making the pizza &quot;packet&quot; outside of the pan, then put the whole thing in the pan and it was easier for me. I will be making these again. I bought the pan from Macy's online for $24.00+tax."
767039,531161,2018/10/27,0,"3 Ingredients? Plus four spices , not to mention the seven or eight ingredients for serving. But carnitas is not just braised pork (roasted in liquid). So without the extra ingredients (the spices), there is very little flavor.. I actually like your recipe, it tasted great, but it is not a 3-ingredient recipe."
865936,502871,2013/7/23,4,"This is a very good potato salad made with yogurt instead of mayo, and I like that.  Mixing in a little olive oil I think gives the dressing some body that is usually missing with a yogurt based dressing.  The creole mustard adds some bite, but not too much."
226863,510491,2013/12/24,5,Great &quot;healthy&quot; cookies!  Loved these.  Easy to make and nice and chocolatey!  Thanks for sharing!

2001756313,533699,2017/10/17,5,"I think this is a super cool idea! BUT, the pans are sold out even on Nordic Ware's site. (This is a Nordic Ware Cakelet pan). I'd definitely try scoping out your local Target stores as others have suggested. Because online - it's a no go. I'm going to try the same recipe but with other shapes of pans - like Bunnies or Tombstones! Cool idea!"

It was on clearance for $25 and I paid 9 in shipping I believe, but I paid over the phone and got it a few days later. Love the pan!"
2001753496,533699,2017/11/1,5,These turned out great! Big hit and very tasty. Ordered the pan from Nordicware and also got the tombstone pan. :) The possibilities are endless as far as fillings and I can't wait to try different combinations.

2002119070,532649,2018/4/17,0,I ran out of time and didn't do the last step of baking the mac and cheese and it still was amazingly delicious!!!
2324285,511485,2014/1/28,5,"This was a great meatless meal.  I loved the layers of flavors in the bean mash and the kale, and a fried egg with a runny yolk was the perfect topping.  This makes 4 small serving, which are perfect for lunch or a small dinner.  It&#039;s not going to satisfy any carnivores, but I thought it was filling and delicious."
163112,511485,2014/2/1,5,Carnivores here &amp; we all loved it!  I did serve it on a night when dd who doesn&#039;t like eggs was elsewhere at dinnertime.  Each component came out just right &amp; were delicious together.  I cooked my own beans vs. using canned which I cooked a couple days ahead.  Thank you for the recommendation in Veggie Swap.  :)
724631,509663,2013/12/7,5,"In my Best of 2013 cookbook!  Loved the bite from the teaspoon of Sriracha sauce; it was not overpowering.  That kept the sauce from tasting too sweet.  This was time-consuming; it would help to have a sous-chef dredging the chicken cubes while the chef patiently cooks a small batch at a time.  On my own, I dredged all the chicken cubes and spaced them on wax paper on a dinner plate (took 4) and chilled them until I started cooking. I lined a deep skillet with paper towels to collect the cooked chicken cubes, and that worked like a charm.  I pureed my marinade in a blender.  I forgot to sprinkle green onions for the photo; they are a good counterpoint to the sauce.  I&#039;m glad I stepped out of my comfort zone to try this recipe; it&#039;s a keeper!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
482376,509663,2013/12/17,5,"This baby gets tucked into my best of the best file right away! Delicious!! I made it as directed, except I fudged on the times a bit. I didn&#039;t have as much time as I had planned, so I only marinated and refrigerated for 30 minutes each. It still worked beautifully. The sauce is absolutely delicious and makes for a nice, thick coating on the chicken. The chicken is crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. I really liked the slight spiciness from the Sriracha sauce. You could omit that ingredient and still have a very successful meal. I served this over brown rice with a salad on the side. Thank you!"
226863,509663,2013/12/24,5,"Delicious!  Orange Chicken is one of my son&#039;s favorites, and this was devoured in no time! I put my cornstarch in a plastic bag and tossed the cubed chicken in and shook it up instead of dredging.  Saved me a bit of time.  The sauce was perfect.  I&#039;m sure that this is a recipe that will be requested often!  Thanks for sharing!"
1567897,509663,2014/1/1,5,Excellent recipe.  I added about 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and a bit more sriracha sauce because we like it a bit hotter.  Served over basmati rice.
305531,509663,2014/1/3,5,This was great. The first recipe to be added to my Best of 2014 CB! My 2 Chinese-food loving grand daughters loved this. Next time I&#039;ll use breezer&#039;s tip and coat the chicken in the cornstarch in a ziplock bag. Thanks for sharing Rosie. And congrats on your Football win!
2399085,509663,2014/3/6,0,Made for PRMR. This is really really good chinese food. Chinese food at home! Yes please and thank you.
126440,509663,2014/4/5,5,Made half a recipe for the two of us with three small breasts.  Loved the sauce and turned out great.  Served over rice with an Asian salad.  Perfect spiciness for me with the Sriracha.
386585,509663,2014/9/2,5,"While this was time-consuming, it was worth the effort.  I made this exactly as posted, using a plastic bag to dredge the chicken in the cornstarch.

128473,509663,2014/9/6,5,"Wow, what a killer of a recipe Rosie.  Boy was this good.  We both enjoyed it very much.  It was well worth the extra work and effort.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, crisp yet still tender.  The sauce was amazing, amazing.  So much flavor and they all complimented one another beautifully.  Thank you so much for sharing a new family favorite.  I can&#039;t wait to make this again.  Made for Culinary Quest - 2014 - Suitcase Gourmets."

42672330,509663,2014/11/12,4,"A very good recipe except when I dredged the chicken in corn starch, put it on a tray, and refrigerated it, the bottom of the chicken stuck to the bottom of the tray.  This left the bottom of the chicken uncoated and the corn starch was a gooey mess on the pan.  Is there a solution to this problem?"

2001927933,534899,2018/3/16,5,These were so good! I served them with a hearty beef stew instead of bread &amp; everyone was impressed and loved the cakes. This recipe is a keeper!
6651,501231,2013/10/17,5,"I love roasting vegetables -- it brings out their sweetness. The garlic and thyme round out the flavors nicely.  I didn&#039;t have any truffle oil in the pantry, and will give that a try next time."
386585,501231,2014/2/18,5,"I&#039;ve been dying to try this recipe for the longest time, but had to get my hands on some truffle oil (it is not inexpensive).  I had some beautiful potatoes and carrots from my farm share, which were perfect for this recipe.  I used white truffle oil, which has a very pronounced flavor.  The thyme was the perfect complement to this.  I will definitely make this again.  It would be lovely on any holiday table.  Thanks for sharing!"

461834,514153,2015/3/2,5,"OMG!!  These are so easy and, like it says, you can&#039;t eat just one!!  I made this for one so I just used a medium red skinned potato(that I used a mandolin to slice it), melted butter in a bowl in the microwave.  I dipped the slices in the butter and added them to a preheated cast iron griddle.  I then sprinkled them with sea salt and the paprika and baked them to pure crispy goodness!!!  I had mine with smoked sausage and beans!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for FYC tag game!"

88099,506971,2014/4/27,5,This was very simple to put together except for the phyllo pastry sheets which I don&#039;t have a lot of experience with.  I cut this way back to make 1 pie and decreased the spinach to 16 oz which was plenty for 1 pie (at least for us)  I also cut way back on the feta cheese as was not sure DH would like it or not.    I can see where you could change this recipe up to suit what ever you were in the mood for  Use of different cheeses or add some bacon.  But we enjoyed it just like it was.  thanks for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2014
2706576,495970,2013/2/22,5,One of my all time favorites is cheese and potatoes. I made this recipie as a side dish for a dinner meal. It is easy to prepare. The macaroons are crisp and brown on the outside and moist and cheesy on the inside. They come out of the oven with a very appetising aroma and appearance. These macaroons would also make a great appetizer.
2712608,495970,2013/2/26,5,I served them to company before dinner as an appetizer!! They were such a hit that I wished I had made more!!
2717323,495970,2013/3/1,5,This recipe is simple and simply delicious! Loved how crisp they came out and the flavors were blended perfectly. I plan on making these delectable little darlings a lot. Will be my new go to when asked to bring an appetizer to an event!
2717887,495970,2013/3/2,5,"This was a clever and easy recipe!  It was easy to make and had great flavor.  I served them at a small dinner party as an appetizer and everyone was asking for more!  The aroma was fantastic.  The next day, my kids ate the second patch I had made to try as the side dish with our steak dinners, but really, they were happy to just chow down on these by themselves!  Thanks!!!"
2001609106,504923,2017/7/9,5,Very good salad!
488441,507238,2013/10/10,5,We liked this! I would also use this dip for hot wings or as a &quot;butter&quot; on top of steaks. Great recipe. Made for football pool 2013
226867,507238,2013/10/12,5,Easy to make and yummy! I just mashed the blue cheese with a fork; next time will use my immersion blender.

169430,502700,2013/8/22,5,The folks who didn&#039;t try this for ZWT 9 missed out. It&#039;s richly and complexly Moroccan flavored and just plain tummy. I served it with plain whole wheat couscous. After tasting the stew I knew that the couscous didn&#039;t need anything extra. The couscous was really only there to soak up the stew liquid. I made the full batch and I&#039;m glad I did. I&#039;ll be freezing the rest in several servings to enjoy in the cold months. :D
226863,502700,2014/11/13,5,"Yummy!  I served over rice because that was what I had on hand.  Turned out wonderfully.  I loved all the spices in the dish.  It was very flavorful and warm.  Loved the olives, but might reduce the raisins just a tad next time.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for For Your Consideration at Yuku."
2001957852,502700,2018/2/24,5,"I enjoyed this Moroccan Beef Stew and added some extra veggies. I added some cubed sweet potato, and then some frozen peas. I let the stew simmer on low for 1 hour to make the beef really tender. I served the stew over couscous. I boiled 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock and added 2 diced green onions and lemon zest, then added 1 cup of couscous, and removed the pot from the stove and let sit with the lid on for 5 minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork before serving."
266635,502700,2018/11/23,5,This stew came together quickly and it looks so nice with all the colors. Great aroma too with all the warm spices. I cooked the stew longer to ensure that the beef was tender nice and tender. Will serve over rice for dinner tonight.
2324285,504404,2013/8/6,5,"Great recipe!  I marinated my steaks in basil &amp; tequila and used refried black beans instead of the regular kind.  Served it all over cilantro-lime brown rice.  It was a perfect meal- not too pricey, fairly healthy, and easy to make."

2000442813,511799,2015/8/30,5,I am a notorious destroy of homemade gravy! Even I couldn&#039;t screw this up! It&#039;s delicious! No lumps!
2132682,511799,2017/8/29,4,"Four cups is a lot for 3 people and a lot of Better than Bullion. I just guessed and put some beef roast bullion and chicken in hot water and heated to boiling to dissolve. I don't think I used more than a total of 3 tbsp but tasted with a teaspoon and it was way too salty. So I dumped out water and added some fresh, kept tasting until it was tolerable but still a little on the salty side. Once I got it on my Betty Crocker instant mashed potatoes, it was pretty good. Would make it again."
1072593,529568,2017/4/27,5,This application of French Dip would never have occurred to me (my eyebrows raised in a surprised manner). Equal parts of both impressive and delicious!
2001835018,511799,2017/12/2,3,It was to salty I had to increase water and flour to get the salty taste to acceptable.
65502,503158,2013/8/18,5,Delicious!! I couldn&#039;t decide what to have for dinner tonight and this looked like it would fit the bill. It did! I couldn&#039;t exactly mash up the caraway and garlic but I smushed it as much as possible and it tasted great. I used almost all red pepper because I don&#039;t love the taste of green peppers. I also poached my egg instead of frying it - just a personal preference. Made for my fellow Tasty Tester for ZWT9. Thanks ElizabethKnicely! :)
37449,503158,2013/8/20,5,I used jalapeno for the mild chili pepper and threw in a chopped onion too. Made a great breakfast.Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by team Hot Stuff.
226867,503158,2013/8/24,5,"Nicely done, Elizabeth!  I used a jalapeno for the mild chili, too. Only had yellow pear tomatoes and used part green, part red pepper. Made for ZWT9 Soup-a-Stars"
329769,503158,2013/8/24,5,Reviewed for ZWT9- This made the perfect brunch recipe today and was enjoyed by my family :) Made as written using &#039;&#039;banana&#039; chillies for the peppers
174096,503158,2013/8/25,5,"Wonderful dish!  Loved all the colorful veggies with the egg.  I also opted for some heat with the chili pepper, and we enjoyed the kick.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
371785,507019,2013/11/13,3,"This is different from any soup I&#039;ve ever had.  I chose to use bacon.  Admittedly, I ended up not having any bay leaves to add.  I felt like a little something was missing so maybe that was it.  Different and nice way of having cabbage."
2324285,504731,2013/8/19,5,"Very good.  I think making the drink a few hours in advance would be best, as the flavor really improves the longer it sits in the fridge.  The drink tasted quite gross and strong when I first made it, but tasted divine after around 6 hours.  I skipped the brown sugar and served the drink in martini glasses with some sliced limes and sliced jalapenos.  Thanks for sharing."
2001549969,529217,2017/5/22,5,"This was delicious. I usually cook turkey london broil on the grill, however it was pouring so decided to try it this way. It came out perfectly. I did not use the lemon and only drizzled the olive oil over top and then sprinkled the rest of the ingredients over top and rubbed them in. It still came out very good. Pretty much as good as if I used the grill. Thanks!"
2001579641,529217,2017/6/11,1,How'd it turn out? My whole street died from food poisoning after a block party! (possibly) The recipe says the turkey is done when it reaches 150 degrees. The LAW says otherwise. The STANDARD for cooking poultry is to cook it to an internal temp of 165 degrees. This in NO secret.
2001932139,529217,2018/1/14,4,"Meat continues to cook after its out of the oven, and resting. Good thing you're a member of this site but seems like you haven't learned much still."
2002136323,529217,2018/5/1,0,"It took my oven longer to broil. more like 8-10 minutes before it turned slightly brown. then after it was in the oven for the 20 minutes of &quot;off&quot; time, when i took it out it was 180 degrees. needless to say it was a bit dry. not sure if the longer broil time affected it. I think I will take it out sooner next time."
2324285,511545,2014/1/14,5,"Very good, savory and sweet bread.  The appearance and texture was quite different from the Salvadoran quesadillas that I&#039;m used to, but the flavor was spot-on.  Very sweet, cheesy and had a nice hint of spice from the allspice.  I used Cotija cheese instead of Parmesan, and sprinkled some sesame seeds on the batter before baking."
2399085,506007,2013/8/21,5,"Made for PRMR! I made these for my picky kids today, they loved them. Kid tested, Father approved! Thanks for the recipe. It is a go to meal!"
2000843982,525783,2016/1/29,5,Full of flavor and surprisingly moist being gluten free. So delicious!
2001312658,525783,2016/12/22,0,Making it Idk when but it sounds good
143721,505813,2013/8/16,5,Very nice and easy recipe.  I really like the fish sauce addition.  Made as directed and will make again.  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;
1226388,505813,2013/8/22,5,"This was great! I know I will make it again.  I had it for a light supper this time, but it will work for breakfast or lunch as well.  Had lots of flavor."
328048,505813,2013/8/24,4,"This was the first time I&#039;ve ever successfully made an omelet. I usually do scrambled or fried eggs. It was very tasty and I&#039;ll definitely try it again. I liked the saltiness that the fish sauce imparted. The only problem I had was that it was not crispy at all. I think that if I had made it in a larger skillet (as opposed to the small skillet indicated), the eggs would have spread out more and been thinner and more apt to actually get crispy, but as it was they were nice and brown but not crispy at all."
47559,505813,2013/8/25,4,I enjoyed this omelet.  I added fresh cilantro and chili paste as a garnish and it really kicked up the flavor.  Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers ZWT9.
131126,505813,2013/8/25,4,This was a nice surprise.  I enjoyed the fish sauce and the crispness.  It was a nice change from the norm.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!
107583,501144,2013/6/21,3,"Sorry, this one didn&#039;t work for us.  It wasn&#039;t sweet enough.  All we tasted was evaporated milk and rum extract.  The toasted coconut flavor was lost.  Maybe if made with whole milk it would turn out better."
1925885,503392,2013/7/18,5,"Yummo!!!  Made these this morning for a trip to the beach.  Outstanding! The marinade was soooo good, and the cucumber relish???  So greek!  I&#039;ll be using the relish on so many other things.  Used kalamata olives, giving an even more authentic taste. I&#039;ll try to get pics while at the beach.  Thanks for posting!!!"
266635,503392,2013/7/19,5,"What a delicious wrap!  I marinated both the chicken and the tzatziki overnight and the chicken was moist and delicious along with those scrumptious kalamata olives and cucumbers.  I added a little red wine vinegar to give the tzatziki a little more zip and added some fresh baby spinach leaves to the pita.  This makes a wonderfully healthy and delicious lunch and can be made as a light dinner as well.  Made for ZWT9, July, 2013."
452355,503392,2013/9/11,5,This was a very yummy wrap!  I started marinating the chicken in the morning before work.  It was tender and juicy.  The relish was plentiful and very delicious as well.  I used kalamata olives.  We served with Recipe #120534 as a side.  Thanks for posting!
2652037,493979,2013/1/23,5,Yum!
2653150,493979,2013/1/23,5,"Excellent!  You can taste every part of the fritatta, without the ranch over-powering any of the other flavors!  Fun to make, and a delight to eat!"
2653272,493979,2013/1/23,5,Absolutely delicious!
2657434,493979,2013/1/26,5,delicious!!
2002091893,496688,2018/4/2,0,"Baked for 1 hour, liquid was gone. The top and edges were very brown. So I took it out of the oven. Needless to say, the potatoes were slightly cold still :/ I made another one with veggies and was much more flavorful. Somewhat disappointed with my results."
227978,536322,2018/7/30,5,"Oh my goodness, but is this ever a fabulous recipe. I made it fresh this morning, and I immediately used it on a fresh batch of baked pancakes, and it was a really good topper for the pancakes. The great part is, I still have 3 or 4 more jars leftover (this recipe makes a lot!) to use later on other things. I had never tried this kind of spread before running across this recipe, but it's so good and I will find more used for it. It's so good. Thanks for sharing, sheepdoc. Made for Susie's World Tour 2018 (Pennsylvania Dutch/Amish)."
1098582,505456,2013/10/21,5,"I LOVED this dish.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nicely spicy without being overwhelming.  Very fresh taste but fully satisfying with the noodles.  My wife has requested we put this on the make-again list and I certianly agree.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I really enjoy trying new flavors and this one made me brave my way into the local asian grocery store/market.  The owner was so nice, I showed him my recipe and he found two options for the green curry paste and explained how much better one was vs. the other.  He also gave my daughter a candy, he said he grew up on them.  Awesome experience...  why cooking is so much fun.  I can&#039;t rate this high enough!"
323186,505456,2015/2/6,5,"Yum, this was delicious, Nancy!!   I was generous with all ingredients, particularly the cilantro (we call it dhania, or coriander),  which we love.   Easily prepared, I love this kind of dish,  I did use chicken breast fillets, cubed, but otherwise as directed.    Always great to have a meal that is bursting with flavour, on the table in no time at all.  Thank you for this one, Nancy, a keeper!!!"
2000519210,505456,2016/4/23,5,"This looks like the same recipe Ive made from FoodNetwork webpage many times for my family of very picky eaters who absolutely LOVE this dish! I have found you can prepare the sauce, cook the pasta &amp; chicken ahead of time and assemble very quickly &amp; easily. Great for hot summers when its too hot to cook since its very easy to make and can be eaten hot, cold or room temp. We discovered that its extra yummy if you add a bit of bbq sauce, crushed peanuts and hot chili sauce!"
1802637567,513607,2014/4/2,2,"I so wanted to like these cookies, they sound interesting, but honestly... I wasn&#039;t a fan, I  like the amaranth in them, but the rest just didn&#039;t seem to blend properly."
2001047423,534064,2018/1/17,5,"I found this very confusing - the ingredient list calls for yams &amp; step 1 of the method also does, but step 2 refers to potatoes then yam again??? I have put off making this for months because I had no idea where to buy purple yams, I even have to send away to Jersey from the UK for purple potatoes! I decided to make it with potatoes anyway, the type with brown skin like other potatoes but when you slice them, the flesh is purple &amp; white swirls/ripples like ice-cream. I love purple &amp; they tasted yummers! So did the sauce! I served with battered fish one night &amp; chicken the next, with vegetables, cauli, cabbage &amp; carrots, having made double quantity gnocchi but made the sauce fresh both times. I will use the sauce with many things."
163112,503300,2013/8/17,4,"*I* liked this.  dd liked this.  dh didn&#039;t say much but he didn&#039;t order out, either.  The smallest eggplant I could find yielded almost 4c.  I used it all.  Dh doesn&#039;t like green beans, I cut a zucchini into short, fat matchsticks.  I don&#039;t like mushrooms, the eggplant took care of that.  ;)  I think Thai red curry paste is my new addiction.  No dried shrimp, no cilantro, NOTHING icky - just a bunch of my favorite flavors all schmooshed together!  The lime zest really perks things up in a happy way.  This comes together really quickly.  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers.  :)"
228458,503300,2013/8/23,5,"Mmmm, gotta love a good stir fry recipe that is easily adjusted to what needs to be used in your crisper :). I used eggplant, green beans, broccoli, and cabbage, and at the last minute threw in a bit of edamame for extra protein. I didn&#039;t so much measure the chili paste as dump, so it came out nice and hot..yum! I didn&#039;t so much care for it with the lime, so I will probably go without next time. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
315565,503300,2013/8/27,4,I like this due to the versatility and it uses on hand types of ingredients. I had lots of beans to use up so worked perfectly for me. Made foe Family Picks
329769,503300,2013/8/31,5,Reviewed for ZWT9 Family Picks- I really enjoyed this dish and really any veges on hand could be used. I used more curry paste and coconut milk than called for in the recipe as I love having the extra sauciness served over rice. 5 stars for a simple recipe that was really tasty.
2202186,495060,2013/2/15,5,Quite a tasty recipe. My children and husband alike think I should add it to our favorites list.
2695947,495060,2013/2/16,5,looks amazing.  I will have to make this soon!
2696050,495060,2013/2/16,5,Super delicious and easy to make!
2647321,495060,2013/2/16,5,This sounds great!
2697328,495060,2013/2/17,5,This is our families favorite for pizza night.
2202171,495060,2013/2/17,5,Yum!!
2696116,495060,2013/2/17,5,An excellent recipe.  This is a nice change from the typical pizza.  It has a good blend of flavors and adds interest to a meal.  Definitely a keeper.
126440,512372,2015/7/17,5,Loved this easy and delicious recipe.  Made half for the two of us and DH had 3 bowlfuls.
2001359249,519416,2017/1/20,5,This is an amazing recipe!! And very easy to make!
1802471124,519416,2017/4/5,5,"My boyfriend ABSOLUTELY LOVED this recipe and made sure that I printed it out so we can make it again. I love it too, and I don't even like mushrooms. I actually ate mushrooms...lol. Does this recipe freeze well?"
2000089875,519416,2018/4/18,2,"I strongly suggest pan-browning the chicken 5-8 min. (lightly coated with flour, and a little salt and pepper) before committing it, with the other ingredients, to the oven. My first attempt with with this recipe resulted in terribly under-cooked chicken."
461834,497908,2014/6/19,4,"Wonderful and very different chicken saltimbocca for us!!  We really enjoyed the added mozzarella cheese.  The directions are very confusing for both the sage leaves and the amount of lemon juice.  I just covered one side of our chicken cutlets(two for DH and I ) in sage leaves, then wrapped them in the prosciutto slices, but no way would you need the amount of sage leaves listed for this recipe(48-55 sage leaves), all you would taste would be the sage.  Then it listed 1/4 -1/2  juice of a freshly squeezed lemon and then in the directions it just stated &quot;Sprinkle a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice on each cutlet&quot;.  For me, part of the reason I love this type of chicken recipe is for the wonderful, lemon, wine and butter flavored sauce and I couldn&#039;t really taste the lemon with just a sprinkle of lemon on the chicken.  I have made this kind of recipe many ways and I really liked the different cheese, then I have tried in the past (just parmesan), just would change the amount of sage and lemon juice.  Thanks for sharing another great recipe for us to enjoy ForeverMama!!   Made for a tag game (but no one is able to access them, so not sure which one, but I think it was PRMR tag game)"
369715,498133,2013/6/14,3,I liked this but no one else in my family did. I followed the recipe as written other then I used 32 ounces of chicken broth.
780172,502839,2013/7/15,5,"I always like green beans with bacon, but the addition of the other spices, brings this up a notch. Spicy and yummy. Made for ZWT9"
305531,502839,2013/7/19,5,So simple and good. Thanks for sharing twissis. Made for ZWT9.
2000338499,508749,2015/7/14,5,This Cheesefish is top notch! Probably the best cheesfish i&#039;ve had in years
340141,502839,2013/7/21,5,"Exquisite!  Even if your fresh green beans have turned and you have to use canned ones.  I used the spices from Recipe #502857 and some apple hardwood smoked bacon.   It was in chunks of meat versus stripes, with less fat, so I just added some extra oil.   After the onions were softened, I simmered the beans for about 10 min to heat them and to make sure the bacon was done.   Really outstanding.   ZWT9"
461834,502839,2014/12/9,5,"I found I really enjoy the Cajun/Creole flavors during our Quest/ZWT events and this was so good!!  I did use canned French Style green beans, the grease from the bacon (for the oil) and red onion, but otherwise, used the items called for in the recipe.  I did cut back a bit on the Creole seasoning, as I didn&#039;t have a full pound of green beans."
373020,502292,2015/2/11,5,"As a fellow Aussie (pronounced Ozzie) these are spot on and delicious!  Gotta have beetroot, its iconic and makes the burger."
280271,504310,2015/1/19,5,What a hit this was...served it during a football game...the guys really enjoyed it...as did the women...but the guys went back for seconds...I had to grab one for the photo...It really does remind me of a nice rich pound cake...everyone like the topping but the cake part was the big hit...I cooked it in my 9 inch spring form pan for 1 hour and 20 minutes before it was done...the only negative was that the cake itself stuck to the bottom of the pan...even though I greased and dusted it very well...I was lucky and got it off in one piece...the pour of the left over sugar mixture may have been the cause...but I know the hubby will be asking for this again...thanks for posting it...made for...&quot;For Your Consideration&quot; tag game...in my best of 2015 cookbook...=)
2002183844,504310,2018/10/20,5,We loved it! Thanks so much!
653438,506867,2013/10/1,5,"Made this for My 3-Chefs October 2013 tag game and I wasn&#039;t disappointed (DH gobbled it down).  I did cut the recipe in half but otherwise followed the instructions.  Served over fritos, topped with green onions slices, cheese and sour cream.  Had a green salad on the side.  Thank you for posting."
470652,526583,2016/4/18,5,"Yum! This was a great cake. Made exactly as instructed and the result was a moist, flavorful and pretty cake. I will try this again using a different flavor pudding mix and see what happens. Thanks so much for this super easy and wonderful cake!"
296809,505841,2013/11/15,5,"Found this recipe while browsing your collection for a Football Pool win recipe choice. It sounded easy + tasty &amp; got saved. I have a huge fondness for recipes of the Czech/German genre &amp; this lived up to my expectation. It is definitely the best schnitzel I have made. The meat was tender, flavorful &amp; perfectly cooked. The sauce is divine &amp; should not be skipped for any reason. Served w/rice &amp; broccoli, it was perfection. Thx for sharing this much-favored recipe w/us. (Pic will post late today)"
226863,502468,2013/6/30,5,Very easy and delicious stir fry!  I doubled the amount of broccoli because once I cut my pork loin into strips it just looked like I needed more broccoli.  Also increased the scallions a little bit.  This turned out to be delicious!  Thanks for sharing! Made for Photo Tag game.
137302,515673,2014/5/3,5,Excellent Alfredo Sauce.  It was so tasty that we simply ate it with egg noodles and Homemade Wheat Bread.  It didn&#039;t really need meat since there is so much cheese in the recipe.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
280271,497106,2013/10/15,5,These were delicious...I cut the recipe in half but I did double the sauce like the chef suggested...it didn&#039;t say to turn the wings but I did about every 15 mins or so...also no instructions on what to do with the left over marinade...so I tossed it...but I guess if you weren&#039;t going to toss the cooked wings in more sauce you could use the marinade to base the wings...thanks for posting it...=)
2000143368,497106,2015/4/15,5,"This recipe is  DEAD ON! I was a little nervous while buying the ingredients lol, but soooo glade I did!!.So good that I had to sign up  just to login and leave a comment..I did fry the plain chicken wigs prior to adding the sauce ,and they came out with a little crispiness!"
2001071362,497106,2016/7/2,5,"I've used this recipe quite a few times now, that I have to say these are one of the best chicken wing I've had. I've made these chicken wings for friends and they can't get enough."
323186,517907,2014/8/25,5,"Very simple and very tasty, enjoyed with rice this made a good dinner. I especially liked the use of the coconut milk, and I used coconut oil to cook with, enhancing the lovely flavour.   Thank you MarraMamba,  made and enjoyed for Agents of QUEST, South America"
67728,517907,2014/8/26,5,"I haven&#039;t eaten moqueca in forever, and never a homemade version, so I was pretty excited to try this! I enjoyed this just as much as the fish versions that I&#039;ve tried in the past at Brazilian restaurants, especially since I was finally able to find the dende oil in the supermarket. This was perfect with a big scoop of Brazilian white rice. I did make this with a full 2lbs of shrimp, since I didn&#039;t see any reason not to add the extra half-pound that was in the bag. I think it was better for us this way, anyhow, since DH usually leaves behind most of the extra sauce when I make saucy things for dinner. This way there was a more even distribution of shrimp to sauce. Definitely a keeper, thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest I"
169430,517907,2015/3/3,5,"This is officially my new favorite way to do shrimp. It&#039;s almost too simple to be so good. I wouldn&#039;t change a single thing about this recipe (and I don&#039;t say that very often, lol). The flavors are deep, rich and so satisfying. Served with garlic rice it made a wonderful dinner. A total keeper."
2002016228,517907,2018/2/26,5,"I can’t wait to make this. So inviting and delicious yet simple to put together. I’m a fan of your quick , amazing recipes."
560491,507244,2013/10/8,5,"Very different than what I would normally eat, but so glad I tried it!  The toasted walnuts give it such a nice flavor and the cheese was the right amount if salty with the sweet jam.  My stove has a griddle with a panini press so I used that; the panini design didn&#039;t imprint, but it helped fuse it together.  Made for PRMR."
381180,507244,2014/5/4,5,"Loved all the flavors together ~ especially the walnuts with the jam.  I didn&#039;t get it as gooey as I&#039;d hoped, but t&#039;was the first time using my new Lodge grill pan!  Tagged for Rookie Recipes, due 05/13/14."

724631,512987,2014/2/7,5,"Very tasty, went well with Recipe #421201!  I experimented a lot with this recipe.  1) I followed Recipe #513018 for pressure cooking the carrots; in the past I have been frustrated by how long carrots took to become tender; 2) I halved the recipe, although by mistake I used 1/2 cup currants, so I also used 1 cup orange juice; I should have also used the original amounts of sugar and spices, even if only using 1/2 lb. of carrots, cut in 2&quot; lengths, sort of (as the carrot grew thicker, I made my cut shorter so each piece had about the same mass).  The carrots were cooked through but not mushy, even after I prolonged the simmer for the time for my roast chicken and rolls needed to finish.  Note: I will use my imbalance of currants and sauce to make a currant bread (a somewhat Moroccan Raisin Bread?).  Great change of pace!  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag."
1803002054,507768,2015/2/7,5,The best pizza recipe I have found to date!  Wonderful combination of flavors and easy to make!  S.O. can&#039;t get enough of it.

126440,507768,2013/10/31,5,Loved this pizza.  Used fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden and was sooo good.  Loved the spiciness of the sauce.
212609,496026,2013/3/2,4,"I had every intention of making the Blue Cheese Dip to accompany this-but we ended up taking a leaf out of rpgaymers book, and just eating it as a side.....<br/>What a totally different, and delicious way to eat cauliflower...not only that, it was simple enough for anybody to attempt, and get good results.<br/>Thumbs up for you rpgaymer.....Made for PRMR."
679953,496026,2013/9/14,5,"What a unique way to prepare cauliflower, and had great flavor.  I did cut back the hot sauce in half, and omitted the salt.  Enjoyed the dip especially. Had a nice zing (hotness).  Served this with recipe#457758#457758  and made for a nice dinner."
37449,496026,2013/9/30,5,I really enjoyed this different way of eating cauliflower. I love roasted cauliflower but this took it up a notch with the hot sauce and butter. Thanks!
280271,496026,2013/11/10,4,Hubby really enjoyed this with the blue cheese cheese dressing...I don&#039;t care for blue cheese so I ate mine my its self...I found it on the salty side...so next time I would omit the salt...I think the red hot sauce has plenty in it...we love cauliflower so it was nice to try something different...thanks for posting it! =)
266635,496026,2013/12/14,4,"Made this cauliflower last night and it was quite tasty.  We always prefer blue cheese dressing with hot wings and it worked perfectly with the cauliflower as well. I followed the other reviewers&#039; comments and omitted the salt and cut back on the hot sauce. Made for PRMR, December, 2013."
2001332570,496026,2017/4/3,5,Loved this recipe the only difference is I used Bolthouse yogurt blue cheese dressing.
80353,503937,2013/7/14,5,"Still licking my chops with this recipe.  We love beets, but I hate the prep (and red fingers) so I always buy bags of vacuum-packed, pre-cooked beets from the supermarket - a great timesaver and very inexpensive.  The dressing was wonderful and I added capers &#039;by eye&#039; as they are stated in the directions but seem to be a forgotten ingredient in the ingredient list.  Bright, sprightly flavours that counterpoint the sweet, earthy deepness of the beets."
107135,503937,2013/7/19,5,"wow oh wow this good,canned beets,im just saying try this onezwt9"
37449,493969,2013/9/22,5,I love putting lots of herbs in my salad and this used a nice amount! I enjoyed all the flavors. I halved the recipe and had enough for 2 servings. Thanks!
582561,494191,2013/3/17,5,"A tasty treat that is quick and easy to make.  I haven&#039;t an ice cream maker, so whipped it a couple of times as it was freezing.  Well worth making and healthy with it.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap March 2013."
1680722,508010,2014/9/11,5,"This was a fish feast! I defrosted the fish into colded water and I prepared the recipe as you suggested. I used all fresh herbs from the garden, expect green onion from the shop and it was really delicious! We enoyed it with mashed potatoes (Recipe #318025) and beet salad (Recipe #518221). Thanks a lot for this great recipe, I wil do it again!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
1535,495227,2014/3/1,5,"Fantastic!! I can&#039;t believe no one has tried this recipe. It came together beautifully and the taste was excellent. We used regular bacon since we couldn&#039;t find apple-smoked. It would help to let the cream cheese come to room temperature so it would be easier to spread. Other than that, this is a true 5-star recipe in our house. Lovely!"
12577388,495227,2014/5/21,5,My husband keeps asking me to make this chicken again and again for him since it&#039;s his favorite. Sometimes I stuff the cream cheese in half a jalape&ntilde;o pepper and roll it into the chicken along with the spinach or other veggies that I have on hand. I usually just use regular bottled ranch dressing and that works well too. And the applewood bacon really adds a great flavor. It comes out great either baked in the oven or grilled on my Weber. It&#039;s a winner every time!
1802551452,511777,2014/3/4,0,"This soup is very good and very filling. I added a pound of lean hamburger for more protein. It does make a HUGE pot of soup, so make sure you have freezer bags when you make it."
2000995455,535318,2018/4/27,5,1 cup of Apple JUICE Dash of liquid smoke. Season with cajun spice.Stand ribs up meat side against outside of the pot.
107135,503199,2013/7/30,5,this reminds me of popovers. very good.mr picky mowed through these
1745502,503199,2013/8/5,4,"Ok, I made a lot of mistakes when making these, so take my rating with that caveat. First, I got distracted just after adding the flour, but before whisking it in. So it got lumpy. Next time I would add gradually or use an electric beater. Second, I put too little batter in the pan, so they were paper thin. The last batch came out just right though when I poured about the depth of sheet of corregated cardboard.  Really liked this technique of making one giant cake and cutting it before flipping. They were eggy tasting which was yummy for me, less so for DH. I ate them with maple syrup and blueberries."
2597942,509140,2013/12/5,5,"Chocolatey!!!! I made a batch of this tonight, and almost finished it by myself. I&#039;m on mug #4 (and the last of it) right now. I think I may add a bit more milk next time (and there will be a next time). I did not use &quot;Nutella&quot;, instead I used &quot;Jif Chocolate Hazelnut Spread&quot; (I like it better). Of course I had to toss a few mini marshmallows on top, otherwise it&#039;s not truly hot chocolate in my book. I&#039;m wondering now if I were to make a larger batch, then store some in the fridge to re-heat another day, if it would work okay or be to thick and gloppy. I guess the only way to know is to try. None left tonight, so a new batch is in the near future. Thanks for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
2324285,509140,2014/1/2,5,"This was a delicious treat for a cold winter.  I doubled the recipe to make more servings, and added a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a dash of salt- weird ingredients, I know, but I always add it to hot chocolate for a unique twist.  The hot chocolate was super-chocolately and rich, as I was hoping.  I did not really taste the nutella, but it added a nice creaminess to the drink."
895132,503974,2013/7/17,5,"Mmmh, comfort food! The first gumbo I&#039;ve ever made and tried, and I loved it. I had no original andouille sausages but some French sausage that maybe comes a bit close. For the roux, I used sweet rice flour to make it gluten free, which worked very well. I just got cold feet when I added the veggies and sausage to the roux because I thought it was starting to burn, so I dumped the broth in a bit early LOL It still turned out delicious - my first attempt to make roux, too! Thanks for sharing this winner :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Cajun for The Apron String Travelers"
226863,503974,2013/9/11,5,"Loved it!  I make one very similar, but add corn as well.  The only suggestion I have is for half of the creole seasoning to be a salt-free version, or you&#039;ll end up with a very salty gumbo.  The smell while this is cooking will drive you crazy.....it smells wonderful!  I threw in a bit more okra because I had some I had just picked that needed to be used up, and used basmati (popcorn) rice since that is what I&#039;ve always been served in New Orleans.  I&#039;ll definitely make this recipe again.  Their is a rich depth of flavor that I think anyone would enjoy! Made for Rookie tag game."
144373,504870,2013/8/11,5,"Delicious, my family loved this salad.   Made as written.  Made for ZWT9 ~ The Apron String Travelers."
780172,504870,2013/8/28,5,"This was a very nice salad, it was nice not to have to cook on the stove on this very hot and humid day. We enjoyed the ham and pineapple combo. Made for ZWT9."
251917,504870,2014/3/31,5,Aussie Swap #86: YUM - a refreshing twist on typical chilled salads!! I will be making this one throughout the spring/summer months - bring on the BBQs ;)
143721,505798,2013/8/20,5,"OK, have to admit that at first glance I did not think I would like this soup.  Boy, was I surprised!  It is very light and refreshing.  Made as directed.  The fresh ginger and the herbs really makes this soup!  Great summer time lunch.  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;"
169430,503652,2016/5/16,5,I reduced the amount to 1 serving and then made half of that amount as I was making this recipe just for myself. Doing so brought the amount of brandy and wine to just 1/4 tsp each so I just skipped it and it wasn't missed at all. I did add the salt and pepper to the tomato topping at the beginning of cooking and peppered the shrimp while cooking. This made a lovely meal with a fresh green salad.
37636,498727,2014/2/7,5,"I used butter instead of margarine of course. I also did not split these but left them as is, brushed with butter and sprinkled with herb and baked an extra 2 minutes since mine were thicker."
520830,531108,2017/4/14,5,Thank you so much for posting these instructions from a trusted source. The cake mix companies did us a disservice when they shrunk the mixes. This will help bring back the deep cakes we all loved.
1072593,531108,2017/10/26,5,Let's celebrate!! Is that birthday cake I smell?
2001141485,505641,2016/8/25,0,i was so excited to come across this website for my peppers and awesome sooooo easy thanks again
1802540858,496138,2014/3/1,5,"This is an awesome salad.  We enjoy mostly in the summer, but recommend it anytime!  I have eliminated the onions and added avocado on occasions to change it up."
1800126678,503185,2013/10/15,1,"In spite of a great smell while cooking, the flavor was nearly non-existent. It tasted like canned tomatoes. It needs a little more more salt, perhaps some sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. And definitely it needs more spices."
1803064843,505641,2014/8/23,5,"These pepperoncini&#039;s are awesome, they are so easy to do and taste great. I refrigerated them before opening and the peppers are soooo crispy. I am doing all my peppers this way from now on. If you are growing them make a bigger batch of vinegar brine and refrigerate until you are ready to use as the peppers ripen. Definitely growing MORE pepperoncini&#039;s nex year t!&lt;br/&gt; I would love to see Sweetiebarbaras pickle recipie!"
10437416,505641,2014/10/21,5,This recipe was so easy and delicious! I will make these every year. Thank you!
2000221552,505641,2015/6/18,5,"Just tried this. I grew my own Peperoncini&#039;s , only have one bush but there&#039;s alot of peppers. It was very easy canning to do &amp; I&#039;m  a novice . I will update my review after the 3 week canning curing before I cheat &amp; eat them."
2000377354,505641,2015/8/1,2,"This is a great recipe but after leaving them on my shelf for over a year, the olive oil began to turn black. The older peppers tasted horrible! but if consumed within 2-6 weeks id say its great"
2000380043,505641,2015/11/15,4,This is a great recipe - my husband loves it and it&#039;s super easy to make.
2684581,494926,2013/2/9,5,Really delicious and easy to make for parties!
2684792,494926,2013/2/9,5,I would eat this both for dinner and as desert with that same dinner!
2667997,494926,2013/2/11,5,I wish I could have this for dinner every night!!!!
2668181,494926,2013/2/12,5,Oh my gosh!  So good!
2694923,494926,2013/2/15,5,I love the spinach in there! Healthy and delicious!
2667986,494926,2013/2/18,5,So yummy!
2667917,494926,2013/2/18,5,Tried these.  They are delicious!
2001093303,505641,2016/9/8,5,OMGOSH! Tried these for the first time this year as we had a bumper crop of pepperoncini. This recipe was quick and easy. They turned out excellent and it's true.....they are quite addictive. Bet you can't eat just ONE!
2001187526,505641,2016/9/29,5,"I split my batch and put some up without a canning bath and some with. The unprocessed were so good. The canning bath cooked the pepperoncini, removing their wonderful crispness. I won't do that twice unless there's a way to hot water can without cooking the product."
2001677116,505641,2017/8/18,0,Can I use white vineger instead of apple cidr vinegar?
2001712131,505641,2017/9/13,0,Just picked almost a full 5 gallon bucket and I'm going to be pickling these soon. I'm curious as to why you add in the olive oil to each jar. What's the purpose of it?
2001779331,505641,2017/11/5,4,Delicious flavor but they were not crisp at all. They were pretty mushy. Any secret on ensuring they end up crisp?
2002200991,505641,2018/6/28,0,"it says to slit the peppers, have big of a slit? and why?"
2002230574,505641,2018/7/26,0,"When you say &quot;Store in a cool dark place&quot;, does that include the fridge? Also, do you know how long the stay good for?"
2002259967,505641,2018/8/28,4,"It was easy but I had a heaping 4 cups of peppers, and it made 5 pints...except I made 2 batches of the vinegar mixture since it only filled less than 4. I only needed about one extra cup, but it's only water and vinegar and salt.. The recipe states it mades 2 pints, but it makes more than that. Probably more like 4. I stretched it to 5 with the added liquid, and I had so many peppers! I can't wait to try them."
2002265850,505641,2018/9/4,3,"Mine still taste strongly of the vinegar. Any advice, and any way to create more flavor? Thank you"
560491,496517,2013/9/30,5,These are so good and decadent!  I could not find the Simple Potatoes mashed potatoes so I used Ore Ida frozen/ steamed mashed potatoes.  So rich and creamy and easy to put together; my mom and brother came over for dinner and I was able to mixed these up ahead of time and just pop them in the oven.  Made for Football Pool Win 2013-14.
2423055,497137,2013/3/11,5,Wow this sounds SO good. Am anxious to try it! nj
305531,501307,2015/4/13,5,What a yummy breakfast. I haven&#039;t had steak and eggs in a very long time and this really hit the spot. So good and filling. Thanks for sharing. Made for What&#039;s on the Menu tag.
2000740229,524946,2015/12/11,5,"Wow! The grapes are a pleasant surprise, but sweet and savory are always a great combination. Thank you Ragu and thank you, Rachel !"
2000724379,524946,2015/12/2,5,Delicious pizza! I love the sweet and savory combo. Great if you are in the mood for something a little outside the box.
2000727970,524946,2015/12/4,5,An excellent and highly enjoyable dish.  The way the flavors meld into a synergistic whole really makes this pizza stand out.
2000732384,524946,2015/12/7,0,"I loved this recipe! The 3 cheeses were not at all stringy. The combination of the herbs was savory, and the grapes added a little sweetness, but not too much. I also enjoyed the added slight nutty flavor of the pine nuts.All in all, this is a great recipe for a light pizza!- DFontana"
2000737551,524946,2015/12/10,5,I love the goat cheese and grape combination of this recipe. The opposing flavors really complement each other. Fantastic!
2000737581,524946,2015/12/10,5,Served this epic little number at our annual fancy cheese party. Pairs well with ALL OF THE WINE! #addingtorecipearsenal
2000737633,524946,2015/12/10,5,"This was a combination I never would have thought of, delicious!"
2000740114,524946,2015/12/11,5,I love goat cheese on pizza. The sweetness of the gapes adds just enough pizzaz. My kids love it too. Very tasty.
498271,505395,2013/8/16,4,"Tasty dish that&#039;s easy as can be!  The spices worked well with the oj and was great over couscous.  I made half the recipe but kept the cayenne the same as we like a bit of heat.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
143721,505395,2013/8/31,5,Made this today for dinner.  The aroma while it is cooking is fantastic.  Great and easy to make.  Next time I&#039;m going to increase the liquid ingredients cause I want more sauce.  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;
2908788,497579,2013/9/15,0,This cake is really good and moist!  With a husband with diabetes that has a killer sweet tooth this was just the thing.  I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts.  It freezes really well too.
266635,504102,2013/8/19,5,I really enjoyed this carrot salad -- the cinnamon in the dressing really makes this dish as do the lemons and the flavored lemon oil.  Makes a beautiful presentation and it&#039;s really easy to put together with the aid of the shredding disc on the food processor.  I used the smaller holes so the salad is a bit on the finer side vs. coarsely grated carrots.  Made for ZWT 9.
895132,504102,2013/8/23,5,"This was the best carrot salad I&#039;ve ever had! The lemon was awesome - I could repeat this salad every day, and I&#039;m not the biggest fan of carrots LOL Thanks so much for sharing this gem!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Morocco for The Apron String Travelers"
131126,505660,2013/8/18,4,"I made this early in the day and by dinnertime it was almost too hot from the red pepper flakes to enjoy.  It was also a tad tart.  Next time I plan to reduce the red pepper flakes by half and up the sugar/splenda.  I think this would be terrific to add a twist to a cucumber, tomato, onion salad.  I did use the rest today as a dipping sauce with spring rolls.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
133174,505660,2013/8/20,5,"This dressing was a pleasant surprise.  After mixing it I wasn&#039;t sure I would like it due to having no oil in it.  It was served over a mixed green salad that had carrots, fresh garden tomatoes and cucumbers.  Really quite tasty.  The dressing was mixed and served immediately.  If allowing the dressing to stand for awhile it might be wise to cut back a bit on the red pepper as Susie D suggested.  Made for the Thai Week Challenge during ZWT9."
169430,502076,2013/7/26,4,"Very nice. I made this yesterday for a dinner and cards evening with friends. Two of us loved it and two weren&#039;t to sure at first but 1 came around to the like point if not total love but the tome he had finished his glass (DH went back to Bud Light, sigh). I think this would be really good with orange water also. I used Splenda to sweeten."
128473,503701,2015/8/6,5,"I loved these sofie... Wow the flavor.  They were so good.  These delicious dumplings were quick and easy to make.  I enjoyed them so much I forgot to get out the dipping sauce, they truly didn&#039;t need it.  They had a nice crust and were soft and tender on the inside.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe which has gone into my Favorites Cookbook for 2015. Made for Culinary Quest -  Japan - 2015."
157425,503701,2016/8/6,5,"Sweet potatoes are one of my favorites usually eaten with sweet flavors but really enjoyed the savory flair. I made half a recipe, cut down on the sesame oil, personal preference, and used chives instead of cilantro. Fried them in coconut oil and did dip a few in the soy sauce. Either way these are very good and easy to make! Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest 2016 - Indonesia/Thailand."
128473,517712,2014/9/7,5,"I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It was quick and easy to make and had a nice depth of flavor.  I used strawberries, blackberries and raspberries.  The vanilla bean and cardamom add another layer of flavor. The spice ratio was spot on.  The berries were sweet, ripe and tender, I served them with Oregon Griddle Cakes  and whipped cream for a truly decadent treat.  Thank you so much for sharing this lovely dessert.  made for Culinary Quest - 2014 - Suitcase Gourmets."
305531,517712,2014/9/11,5,Great stuff. I served this on top of recipe #518078 but can&#039;t wait to try it over ice cream too. Thanks for sharing this nice winner. Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
219942,517566,2018/8/19,5,"I never would have thought of this combination in a million years. It's very different! And if you love figs and bourbon, you'll love this. I used the smaller amount of brown sugar and it was just right for sweetness for us. The mint gave it a refreshing quality. We might even try it without just to see how it would taste, while we still have some figs on the tree that the birds haven't gotten to. Hubby and I loved this cocktail! I will make this again. And I will surprise some bourbon-loving people with a pitcher of it! Thank you, momaphet, this is a keeper for the cocktail file. SWT '18"
169430,504632,2013/8/8,5,"I made 1 cup and well enjoyed the aroma during mixing. It tastes great and I&#039;m looking forward to using it on fish or chicken soon or an egg dish or a prok chop, lamb shanks......"

47892,492975,2013/2/1,0,Made as written although I cut the rice down by half and omitted the bouillon (using some broth instead of water for cooking the chicken). The end product needed more of the spices to add color. The chicken was served with freshly minced cilantro and parsley. I think I would have preferred this dish more if the chicken were pan fried. Recipe #492862 was used to make the spice mixture. Reviewed for NA*ME Explores Oman.
169430,492975,2014/1/23,4,"I also used Recipe #492862 for the spice mix. The end result was still too Spiced for DH to even try but that is just him. Personally I enjoyed the recipe and in particular the saffron mix which I thought did something very nice for the recipe, Made for NA/ME&#039;s visit to United Arab Emirates."
425105,513708,2017/1/24,5,Easy and tasty risotto. I used a mix of homemade veggie stock and some chicken stock made from concentrate.

To get that crispiness back when reheating the tater tot size put in fry pan with a little oil or butter. Fry on med. heat until crispy and heated through. Made for Photo Tag Winter."
461834,496093,2013/3/4,5,"What a fun and easy potato recipe!!!  I made it for one serving and it turned out perfectly with the instructions as written.  I, too, can see changing things up to add more veggies, cheeses and for me, using 1/2 melted butter and 1/2 oil, for added flavor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, will be a repeat at our house.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
482933,496093,2013/9/23,5,Yummy fun! Easy. Crispy. Served with recipe#296743 and recipe#490460.  Thanks for posting.
169430,496093,2014/1/27,5,"I made a half recipe using 2 mini loaf pans and my own cooked shredded spuds. We loved this with a brunch of ham, eggs over easy and apple crisp. This recipe will be making a repeat appearance. :D"
679953,496093,2014/1/30,5,"Great breakfast :). And a nice start to the morning.  I did use sharp cheddar cheese, because that what I had on hand.  Many and endless options too for this recipe, but we enjoyed as is.  Made for Best 2013 Tag."
679953,498353,2013/4/24,5,"Ended up a nice quick meal.  Though it states 1 serving it was plenty for myself, and the 2 kids.  Made this as written, though I left out the scallions, and halved the red pepper flakes.  Very flavorful too.  Made for a quickie dinner.  Made for PRMR tag."
2549237,498353,2013/4/25,4,This recipe is 5 stars for easy and 4 stars because I feel that there was some spice missing.  I will definitely double the crushed red pepper next time.  1 serving of this is huge.  I made 5 servings for dinner and there was enough to feed 10 easily.  Thanks for a quick and nutritious stir fry.  Made for Went To The Market Game.

227978,496093,2014/2/5,5,"Fantastic!  We really enjoyed this recipe, AZPARZYCH.  And so easy to prepare and the kids love them, so there is not reason we cannot have this often.  Made for Best of 2014 tag game."
482376,496093,2014/3/21,5,"I was just about to write, &quot;this is such a fun and easy recipe&quot;, when I looked below and saw that diner wrote that exact same thing! Well, it IS a fun and easy recipe! The potatoes crisp up so nicely and they have a lot of flavor. Very yummy. Thanks!"
1800032310,496093,2014/5/13,5,"These are really good.  I used the Simply Potatoes Southwest Hashbrowns variety and omitted the green onion and spices.  Also, I didn&#039;t have any Parmesan or Cheddar so didn&#039;t worry about the cheese.  I am guessing it supposed to be 1/2 cup of cheese but the recipe just states &quot;1/2 Parmesan&quot;.  My husband didn&#039;t say much but ate 5 of them so I think he liked them.  I will definitely make them again.  By the way, my muffin pans are dark and the hash browns took only 45 minutes at 350."
2001967358,496093,2018/5/3,0,I haven't made yet but have the ingredients. Was wondering about just press g in bottom of 9 by 13 pan and then cutting into squares...?
2002236485,496093,2018/8/1,5,These are AWESOME! Sooo easy and quick to put together and so much flavor! These taste amazing. I have made them for two events now and everyone at both said they were really good! This recipe is also super easy to half if you've got less than a full bag of hashbrowns to use up. I found that this made more cups than the recipe said.
88099,501705,2014/4/13,4,"Nice cake.  I had never had a peanut butter chocolate chip cake before and we liked it.  I think I added too much glaze as it was very, very sweet after adding it.  I was not sure what kind of cake pan to use but a 9x13 worked just fine.  For the glaze I used butter, coffee and chocolate chips that may be why it was so sweet.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
510036,501710,2013/6/30,3,"Posted photo of one of the two pies that this recipe makes in a regular pie pan. The recipe should clearly say usa a &#039;DEEP DISH PIE PAN&#039; since there is no way this would all fit into a regular size pan. We served the 2 pies at a dinner party tonight and while the flavor was good, the consistency was not. The peanut butter portion in the center was mushy, and then with the whipped cream non top, as the pie was cut, it was just mush and did not serve pretty on a plate. Not sure if this is how it was supposed to be, or if I didn&#039;t whip it enough or what. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The taste was not enhanced by the Chips Ahoy cookies, which are not cookies I even buy to eat. But, I always try new recipes exactly as they are first, and then adjust with future attempts. I think it would have been better in a regular pie crust, or even a graham cracker crust. Someone at the party suggested using nutter butter cookies, with the cookie filling scraped off and those cookies crushed instead of the Chips Ahoys. That would enhance the &#039;peanut butter&#039; flavoring of this recipe I think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone at the party raved that it was an excellent pie as far as flavoring and taste, several commenting that they would never have thought the combination would work when told what was inside, and although it was beautiful before it was cut, it was a mess once it was being served. Would definitely try it again using of course a deep dish pie pan, and working to make the peanut butter portion stiffer, and using a different crust. Will definitely keep attempting to perfect this pie!"
2001370135,510494,2017/1/29,5,Delicious! I made it and everyone just couldn't get enough! Let's just say there was no left overs
227978,503438,2013/8/16,5,"Superb recipe, CaliforniaJan!  We really enjoyed it.  The blend of spices in this dish create such a phenomenal taste sensation.  It was truly a wonderful dish that got rave reviews from my family.  I served it with recipe #423494  and a simple white rice dish.  Made for ZWT #9 (North Africa)."
220348,503438,2013/8/17,5,"This was so aromitc, when I was baking it in the oven, I almost didn&#039;t want the cooking to end. But it turned out really good. All the spices blended really well together, and nothing was overpowering."
480195,503438,2013/8/25,5,"I made this chicken as part of a North African brunch. The flavor was fantastic, though I thought it might be overpowering when I read the recipe. Not at all. Not one piece was left and I tripled the recipe. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
526666,503438,2013/8/26,5,"So simple and FULL of flavor, this is a real winner! My propane was out ( :-( ) but I just used the GF grill without putting the lid down, flipping them once. The spice blend is perfect for the region! Thanks for sharing, CaliforniaJan!"
169430,503438,2014/2/4,5,"We&#039;ve been busy doing some house fix up&#039;s (new flooring and paint) so this easy, quick and yummy dish was very welcome. I&#039;m sorry that I missed this in the last ZWT round but It was very much enjoyed in Feb with saffron garlic rice and green beans. :D"
498271,503438,2014/2/19,5,"Just delicious!  Great combination of spices; I used a generous pinch of cayenne and we really enjoyed the warmth it gave.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  Made for the Best of 2013 event, recommended by NorthwestGal"
610488,503507,2013/7/18,5,I have loved Pastitsio ever since I made the one Jeff Smith had in one of his cookbooks. This one is really good and I would recommend it to anyone who has never had it before. The only change I made was to add a little cinnamon to the meat and the sauce. Making the sauce might seem daunting but it is really easy to do. OPA!!! (ZWT 9)
526666,503507,2013/7/27,5,"After eating this for dinner, it is almost like I&#039;ve taken a stroll in the greek countryside! Delish! This is a little involved, but it is sooooo worth every minute! I impressed my SIL, who came for dinner and watched all the preparations. (She&#039;s 26 - someone needs to teach her ;-) ) My DS (9) even enjoyed this, which was surprising to me - he is used to the tour now, and knows some great flavors come his way every summer! I tucked away the 2 extra servings in the freezer, for only ME! Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Jostlori!"
1803592891,501710,2015/1/1,0,"I have made this twice.  I did not like to crust from the original recipe. I used an Oreo crust the second time and liked that much better.  Yes, the pie is not very &quot;firm&quot; in the center, but I have gotten rave reviews on it. Took it to a church dinner and it was totally eaten.  Getting ready to make it again for New Years."
280271,501712,2013/6/21,4,Hubby and I both loved the salmon...the rub is a keeper...but the avocado salsa was on the mushy side from the tomatillos...I think next time I will leave them out...I think the salsa would be really good as a dip...but we didn&#039;t care for the two together...=)
498271,501713,2013/8/11,5,"This is a wonderful grilled chicken!  Absolutely loved the bbq sauce - it&#039;s sweet and spicy and rich and terrific.  Loved the cashew garnish as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
204024,501714,2013/6/29,5,"We loved it! Just the right amount of flavor and it cooked beautifully under the broiler. We did use pork chops instead of chicken, because we had them out for another recipe; that worked nicely."
226863,501714,2013/12/15,5,"We loved this!  I used boneless chicken thighs and cooked on a charcoal grill.  I didn&#039;t worry about putting the foil down, just cooked on the skewers.  I also grilled fresh pineapple with this, and the chicken and pineapple were wonderful together.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for your win in Football tag, week 13."
480195,501715,2013/8/4,5,"I made this as part of a Scandinavian buffet meal. I doubled it and added salt and pepper to the dressing after tasting it. To make it easier for serving, I added mixed the salad with the dressing, and served it on a platter covered in lettuce, with egg wedges and chopped parsley as the garnish. This salad is very good and was well received by all. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
895132,501715,2013/9/6,5,"We love beet salad, and the dressing made from whipping cream brought it over the top! This was so good that we actually both ate two servings. Thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 Family Picks for The Apron String Travelers"
2549237,496763,2013/3/18,3,"I made as directed, except doubled the hash brown mix as to have enough for the side dish.  It looked beautiful however my chicken didn&#039;t cook through, even after an hour and a half so I had to put it in the oven on the broil setting for 15 minutes to finish.  It might have been my fault because of adding the extra hash browns under the chicken in the pan.  Also, I would mix a generous amount of the Creole seasoning right in with the potatoes next time and they were a little bland.  I made this for Zaar Alphabet Soup Tag Spring 2013."
2000418726,504830,2015/8/21,4,"This muffin recipe was an overall good start, but it needed tweaking.  I added 1 cup of applesauce instead of 1/2 cup, and doubled the baking powder and baking soda to make the muffins more moist and less dense. I also added 1 cup of dark brown sugar instead of the white sugar,  2 tablespoons of honey, and 2 tablespoons of molasses. Another teaspoon or two of cinnamon, a teaspoon of ginger, and a 4th egg would also have been helpful to add needed moisture and flavor. I will add them next time, along with 1 cup of chopped apple pieces or bananas (in addition to the walnuts)."
280271,494611,2013/5/4,5,Yummy! This is so delicious...so easy...and so quick...I loved the dipping sauce...I did flip the shrimp half way through the cooking process to brown both sides...thanks for posting it...=)
2001708728,517644,2017/9/10,0,We have 3 'apple boxes' of fist-size apples and 100 lbs. of crabapples. Please advise how many cups and/or quarts equal your idea of 'large apples' :)
213139,498521,2013/4/18,5,"While I did not try the roasted corn &amp; peppers, I did make the creamy chipotle dressing - it was wonderful - later this summer when fresh corn is available, I&#039;ll definitely roast the corn &amp; peppers and try it with this dressing!  Thanks for posting this!"

128473,509719,2013/12/28,5,"Delicious chocolate chip cookies Chef Adriana.  We loved these plump tender little morsels.  They were devine, made exactly as written but added some roasted, salted almonds to the mix.  These cookies did not disappont, they were tender, crispy and delicious.

461834,517982,2014/8/22,5,"OMG!!!  What a refreshing drink!!!  I had never had prosecco before today, so this was nice to try.  It tastes like champagne, maybe a touch sweeter.  With the strawberry puree (which I made using strawberries, agave syrup and true lemon) this was so good, just loved it!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for CQ 2014."
280271,512446,2014/4/12,5,I&#039;m giving this 5 stars because it is so refreshing and delicious!...but once I put the dressing on it was no longer beautiful...I would suggest using white balsamic vinegar...it didn&#039;t say which kind and because I never used the white before I didn&#039;t have it...this is easy to prepare and makes a nice afternoon lunch on a hot busy day...thanks for posting it...Made for Spring 2014 PAC =)
1803075031,518140,2014/8/26,5,What an interesting combination of flavors! The concise directions ease preparation.  A real hit with the family
2697111,495118,2013/2/17,5,This is a tasty dish. Am trying several of the contest entries and this is one of my favorites ! Love that it works for vegetarian guests but my meat loving family also love it.
163112,511399,2014/1/22,2,"Wellllll....I had it in my head that this would be dessert.  Then I decided it would be breakfast for dinner.  2 of us had some, 2 scavenged for leftovers.  I liked the vermicelli (cardamom &amp; rosewater are 2 favorite flavors).  I made a better than usual omelet.  I like the 2 together.  It was difficult to measure 2c vermicelli - it doesn&#039;t measure well such as elbows, etc.  I broke it up &amp; stood it up in a measuring cup.  I used a large wide pan but USE A WOK!!  Wow, tough to stir/turn so, as you can see from the photo, i have diff levels of browning.  And the pasta jumps out of the pan when turning!  It&#039;s the craziest thing.  Woweee....when I added the pasta to the boiling water - WHOOSH!  Massive water boil over!  Please be careful.  In the end...I doubt I&#039;ll make this again but glad I tried it &amp; if you like the ingredients listed, give it a try!!  I still LOVE rosewater &amp; cardamom....  Made for Exploring UAE with the NA/ME Forum 1/14.  :)"
198154,498881,2017/11/10,4,"We used this to season vegetarian Quorn tenders then added mushrooms, onions and assorted bell peppers. It made for some pretty tasty fajitas."
687242,521259,2017/4/21,5,"Simply delicious! Had these at a Christmas dinner, highly recommend this recipe. It's easy to double or triple this recipe to the number of guest, you will be serving. Highly recommend!"
381180,516527,2014/6/12,5,"Big hit with my son&#039;s family!  I soaked eight, thick boneless, chops in a baking soda bath for two hours, rinsed the chops and dried them well, then proceeded with the (doubled) recipe.  The chops were tender and delicious in 45 minutes.  Served with sauteed mushrooms, onions, yellow and zucchini squash."
1803310982,516527,2014/11/7,5,"I made this recipe last night for company.  Everyone raved at how delicious these pork chops were.  One thing, however. You don&#039;t need so much parmesan cheese and bread crumbs.  1/2 cup each would be plenty."
2000009491,516527,2015/8/22,5,EXCELLENT RECIPE!!  I baked as directed and they were so moist and tender.
2000631289,516527,2015/11/1,1,"Well, I followed the recipe exactly to the tee. They were way too tough to eat! Very disappointed and way too much cheese and bread crumbs left over. Will not be making this again."
2000705584,516527,2015/11/24,5,The family loves this!! I came across this recipe months ago and have been using it ever since. I was looking for a pork chop recipe that didn&#039;t involve the meat being fried due to my husband having high blood pressure and I&#039;ve found it. The pork chops come out so juicy and tender everyone just eats them up and there are never any leftovers. Thank you so much for this I wouldnt change a thing with the recipe.
2000341031,516527,2016/1/21,5,This is a really good recipe. I have made it several times. I have even tried different variations of this recipe that I found online and this is by far the best. Like the other viewer Saud only use a half a cup of cheese and crumbs. I always throw out a huge bowl of leftovers. It&#039;s huge waste. If you have big chops a cup of each will work though.
2000887098,516527,2016/2/22,5,"These were sooooo good! By far the best pork chops I&#039;ve ever made at home. I dipped in milk, coated, dipped in melted butter, then coated again. I also brined the chops ahead of time which makes a huge difference I think. Super yummy, super easy!"
2001155636,516527,2016/9/5,5,"Made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic! The only thing I changed was the cooking time The chops I was using were about 2 and a half inches thick, so I upped it to about 55 minutes in the oven. They came out perfectly! The seasoning is simple, but perfect. I used freshly grated cheese, the saltiness was just right."
2001174721,516527,2016/9/19,5,"Good recipe. I followed all directions except in stead of baking the chops, I cook them with some olive oil slow on a griddle. I agree, the recipe calls for too much cheese and bead crumb. I only used the third of the mixture."
2001296725,516527,2016/12/14,0,"So I am not usually the Chef /Cook in our house, but was put in charge of this meal. Just found this recipe and figures what the heck. I agree with everyone else, use less cheese and bread crumbs. Also we didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I made my own with.Panky crumbs, Garlic powder, Onion powder, Oregano, Paprika, and a table blend. Just put them in the oven and they smell AWESOME!!!!! I will update on the families response after dinner."
1802813911,530683,2017/3/19,5,Love the combination of these flavors! Amazing on a toasted Asiago or Everything bagel as well.
2001329588,516527,2016/12/31,0,All those spices are personal preferences.i use them myself.i brush on mayo each side of pork cutlet or chick then coat with italian style bread crumbs also sprinkling grated cheese on top just before baking at 400.comes out very nice.ron
2001462751,516527,2017/3/29,0,Excellent flavor! I should have read the reviews because there was WAY too much cheese/breadcrumbs. Half the stated amount would have been plenty. I also used a mixture of garlic and basil infused olive oil for extra flavor.
2001133147,516527,2017/4/4,0,Very tasty but didn't brown.
2001504487,516527,2017/4/24,0,"I love this recipe. I use this recipe once a week for chops &amp; chicken. I use grated &amp; shaved parm though. This recipe does call for too much cheese &amp; beadcrumbs. I use half. I also leave in oven a lil while longer to get that browning on coating. Not too much longer though, you don't want to bake your meat dry."
2001505149,516527,2017/4/24,0,"Cooking it tonight using 2 pork chops as I'm a widow &amp; live alone. If they taste half as good as the ingredients sound &amp; the picture displayed, I'll be in heaven! Don't have a BBQ or a crock pot, have looked at lots of recipes and yours is the first one I've finally picked. I will let you know tomorrow! THANKS! Pam J. in Colorado"
2001518083,516527,2017/5/2,5,"Wife loved it. Turned broiler on for last two minutes to brown top. Used Hot Shot instead of pepper (hot shot is cayenne pepper and black pepper). Gave it some zip. I ran out of mixture by using 1/2 cup each, so I recommend using exact portions that are called for. But I am liberal with that stuff. Thanks for recipe!"
13037180,516527,2017/5/12,5,"Great recpie for a change of not frying but baking! I love the fry version, but it's also good to do something healthier. Only change I made is I also added Panko with the breadcrumb mixture. I used boneless pork chops, maybe not as thick, but mine was done in 30&quot;. This recipe is a great starter for doing variations. But the original is very good. Served it with small yellow potatoes, I roasted. And a green salad. That's all you need! Good Luck cooks and I hope you liked it as much as I did"
2819684,516527,2017/5/27,5,This is by far my favorite recipe for chops! They did not get overdone &amp; chewy like the other recipes I've tried &amp; they were absolutely delicious!
2001558554,516527,2017/5/28,5,"Perfect Chops - however, you only need about half of the seasoning mix... SERIOUSLY. I always mix half and still end up with some left even after pressing more on. Everyone loves them and they are always moist, easy to cut with your fork. And vegetable oil works just fine as well if you don't keep olive oil (like me)."
2001576479,516527,2017/6/9,5,"I've tried recipe after recipe but haven't found one that actually makes delicious and TENDER pork chops until I came across this one. I have made it several times now and every time the pork turns out delicious! It is now my go-to recipe for pork chops, my super picky 13-year-old gives you 5 stars as well, and that's saying a LOT because she will eat hardly anything!!"
2001758830,516527,2017/10/19,0,I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I took croutons and crushed them up. It was Sargentos garlic and cheese. It turned out great.
428885,516527,2018/1/7,5,"Five whopping stars all the way! I followed this perfectly, but my chops were marinating in buttermilk, as chops seem so tough now a days. So I just used some of the buttermilk with salt and pepper, and went on from there. Delicious!! Thank you so much. Served over top spaghetti."
2001994880,516527,2018/2/16,5,Made these with 1/2 Panko breadcrumbs &amp; 1/2 Italian...trick do not flip during baking. They stay crunchy (er) best recipe ever!! Look forward to making this over and over!!!
1803284901,520110,2014/12/25,5,"Yeah I did it! The cake was wonderful, I made it in our Redmond multi cooker ( we&#039;ve got no oven at home) I used the BAKE program, it was just perfect"
1317270,501007,2013/6/18,3,"Added small amt of chopped dried apricots and chopped pistachio, as well as 1/2 tsp vanilla.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;taking on &#039;road trip&#039; this Sat- healthy munchies! and sooo easy to make!"
2889965,501007,2013/7/4,4,"The batter seemed a little dry, so I added a half cup of no-sugar-added applesauce (instead of oil).  I also added cinnamon, vanilla, walnuts, dried cherries (soaked in boiling water to remove excess sugar), and 3 tbs of agave nectar.  I put a few dark chocolate chips on the top of some cookies, just because I love dark chocolate so much!  I love that this recipe can be modified in so many ways to make a healthier, chewy-granola type treat!  I&#039;ll be taking a couple of these on my next gym trip!"

400708,509581,2014/6/24,5,"Mine didn&#039;t come out looking as pretty as yours (need to work on my shaping) but OMG did they taste great, just like the ones we had with our fast food bratwurst when living in Germany.  Brought back so many memories and they are all good.  I followed your recipe exact, used the egg wash as that&#039;s my preference, and I can&#039;t say enough positive about this.   Crunchy outside with a soft inside and it all held up well to all the condiments we put on our brats.  Another killer bread recipe Red and I can&#039;t wait to try more."
2626782,509581,2016/5/25,5,"I made brat buns using the cups and ounce measurements rather than grams, as indicated. Dividing the dough into 10 pieces and making the buns 6 inches long, were not quite wide enough for brats. I would try dividing it into 8 pieces next time. The buns were perfect for brats. They didn't fall apart when the juice soaked in. I used a metric/US measurement converter to check the conversions in the recipe. The recipe called for 500 grams or 4 cups of flour. 500 grams equals 2.11 cups! 10 grams of salt says to use 1 2/3 tsps. 10 grams actually equals 2 tsps. The 3 grams of yeast should equal .6 tsps not 1 tsp as indicated in the recipe. Not sure what to do. We loved the buns with the wrong conversions, but would it be even better if the conversions were correct? If there is an explanation for the odd amounts, please let me know."
2001116268,509581,2016/8/5,0,"Hi Cubfamily. The problem you're having is that the metric set of measures is based on mass and the imperial units are based on volume. There is no way to accurately convert 500g of flour to a cup measurement. The amount of flour in a cup will vary depending on how tightly the flour is packed. This goes for all non-liquid measurements. For baking, I highly recommend sticking with mass. There are plenty of very inexpensive scales that can accurately measure grams."
2002146457,509581,2018/5/9,5,"This is a great recipe, delish, quick, reliable. The instructions are a bit scant on preparing the dough. First I substituted 100gm of wheat flour for 100gm of white flour, it added some depth to the taste. I mixed the dough (reserving salt) autolyzed for 20 minutes then kneaded with dough hook for 3 minutes. Then I let it set for 15 minutes, sprinkled the salt on the dough and kneaded for another 3 minutes and then autolyzed for 30 minutes and followed the instructions in the recipe. I have found that adding the salt and yeast together retards the rising. The overnight rest worked perfectly and it all went together without a hitch in the morning. I weighed the flour and water and used measuring spoons for the other ingredients. in My experience, a cup of sifted flour weighs 125gm, so that fit perfectly with the recipe. Good show! I use many Genius Kitchen recipes. This is a real keeper."
2000689016,524933,2015/12/2,5,Looks yummy!!
2000386082,524933,2015/12/2,5,"I needed an idea for our next football get together...this is amazing, what a flavor punch!"
2000733636,524933,2015/12/7,5,Sounds and looks delicious!
2000741290,524933,2015/12/12,5,Delicious!! My whole family devoured and raved about this recipe. It made the house smell incredible and the kids even helped form the balls and do the egg dipping and bread crumb rolling. Will definitely make again
37449,504289,2013/8/8,5,Delightful! Will drink this alot. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by a member of team Hot Stuff.
314579,504289,2017/8/2,5,"This was refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day! Easy too. I forgot to strain it and it didn't matter at all (I do have a powerful blender). This could be good with champagne too, maybe next time! Thanks for posting LisG! Stacy G made for CQ 2017, Ethiopia."
226867,504289,2017/8/5,5,Great! I didn't bother straining either! And I used diet 7up not club soda. Loved the ginger flavor!
1803755178,508933,2015/2/7,5,My Mom used to make these for us when I was young and they were my all time favorite but she used sugar. These days I stay away from sugar and was so happy to find this recipe with honey and the option to use agave as well. I also added a little coconut to this recipe and they were wonderful.  Thanks!
2000215909,508933,2015/5/21,5,"Thanks for the recipe!  Peanut butter and chocolate, you can&#039;t go wrong!  I love love! these!  Substitute the agave nectar if possible :-)  I eat a vegan diet and prefer grade B maple syrup or dates (I soak them in a little bit of water or coconut water to make them the consistency of nectar).  Both maple syrup and dates are more nutrient dense than agave nectar.  Even though agave nectar has a low glycemic index, it has a high fructose content, which makes it hard for your body to metabolize.  Anyway, try maple syrup or dates instead, they are both tasty and healthier alternatives to agave nectar!"
2000532836,508933,2015/10/7,5,"I first chose this recipe because I already had all the ingredients in my kitchen, but now I&#039;m addicted. I use honey and almond milk and make half batches, which is still a ton of cookies."
2000643194,508933,2015/11/5,5,i actually like the gooey feeling ( i know i&#039;m a weirdo ) lol .. and it&#039;s a really good recipe for my cheat days ! thank you :)
1636470,494278,2013/3/1,1,"I was really excited about this recipe, I just took it out of the oven now and took a big bite - and yuck, not very good at all. Such a disappointment. I'm going to try some other almond flour based breads, I did not like this one at all. The texture was fine, but I just cant get over the taste."
1800246054,494278,2013/11/13,5,"I love this bread!  It is fairly easy to make and has almost a cake consistency to it!  It has a hint of cinnamon which adds to its unique taste. I eat it by itself, with avocado or peanut butter!  It is so versatile!  You could make it sweeter by adding more xylitol or get rid of the cinnamon if you don&#039;t like that. This is a different kind of bread but so healthy for you. I didn&#039;t care for it straight out of the oven. It is much better cold."
1803330931,494278,2014/11/11,1,I agree with the previous reviewer. I was very excited about this bread and while the texture is really good the flavor is awful. I tried turning it into garlic bread and croutons as well to &quot;rescue&quot; the expensive ingredients but all I could taste was the awful bread ... Bleck ...
12969096,494278,2014/12/27,1,I was very excited to find this recipe but when I took it out of the pan I could smell an ammonia like odor.  when it was cool I sliced it and buttered it..... the scent could not be covered up... I don&#039;t know if this is the taste that others complained about or not.  I followed the directions very carefully except I didn&#039;t add the &#039;optional&#039; cinnamon.  Does anyone know what might cause this?
2001585978,508933,2017/6/16,5,"I have been making your recipe for two years now. I've lost count of the number of batches that I've made - this is now the GoTo treat recipe in our house. (I'm estimating it somewhere in the double digits.) There are two reasons I love this recipe: one, it tastes fantastic. Two: I often make these for my students who are on any number of dietary restrictions, and I love how it covers so many bases. (Gluten free? check. Can't have dairy? use almond milk. Peanut butter? use almond butter. ) I get rave reviews from everyone (on restrictions or not) every time - the combination of honey, chocolate, peanut butter is just fantastic. For that reason I never substitute out the honey, which makes this a non-vegan item. Someday I will try a small batch with agave nectar and see if that does the same for me. If so, then bam, I'll have the vegan version too. But if it's not as good, then it has to be honey. Once I didn't have oil so I used butter. It tasted great that time too. I do make one tweak: I only use 5 cups of oats. I found that with 6 it was a tiny bit dry for my taste. I shared this recipe with someone else and they found that to be true as well so we both use only 5 cups now."
137302,515483,2014/5/3,5,This BBQ sauce is very good.  I never have put molasses in a bbq sauce before but was surprised that it added so much in flavor.  Every one who walked into the room when it was simmering commented about how good it smelled.   Made for PAC Spring 2014.
107583,515483,2014/5/6,5,"Great flavor and unlike the bottled stuff, not full of salt!  Easy to make, too.  I will make this often to use as a basting sauce and as a dipping sauce.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
679953,516031,2014/5/26,5,"This was a fantastic dessert, though I used low-fat milk, and the cooking time in my cooker was 3 1/2 hours.  Probably different sizes, but it did not burn.  This came together real well.  I was going to add some chocolate chips to this, but the recipe looked fine as is  I for one like chocolate pudding, the DS let hers cool in the fridge, and I had mine while still warm.  They were both good either way.  Tagged and made for PRMR.  Thanks Pat for a nice dessert.&lt;br/&gt;.  Forgot to mention served with some vanilla ice cream."
107135,516031,2014/7/24,5,ok wowser this was good and easy too.  you dont have to warm  up the house with an oven to make cake.i melted 1/4 stick of butter in crock pot  and poured batter over it and used a stick of butter in batter which makes up amount called for . make this
2001446906,516031,2017/9/20,1,"The pudding tasted ok but i dont know if id done anything wrong, though i follwed the recipe step by step. it wasnt very chocolatey and the sauce was just gloopy. It was like jelly. Over all, not the nicest thing ive ever made"
1803558176,495058,2014/12/25,1,Wasted Ingredients on this. Wish the title stated these are not the original Pillsbury recipe and are a light version. These is not the same.
171790,498276,2013/5/18,5,"It&#039;s incredible just how good a vegan &#039;cheese&#039; sauce can taste. I&#039;m going to be making this sauce again, just for broccoli or cauliflower, without the orzo. The instructions didn&#039;t mention when to add the nutritional yeast so I incorporated it in step 2. Almond milk was substituted for rice milk since that&#039;s what I had on hand."
2067245,498276,2013/7/11,5,"I was skeptical at first, since this is vegan, but it&#039;s awesome."
2198354,498276,2013/7/11,0,Loved this recipe!!!
82761,506732,2018/1/4,4,A great side to accompany seared tuna.
2000936357,517101,2017/1/7,5,"Using the US measurements, I cut this recipe in half for two people. The only changes I made was using Kuri winter squash that I had on hand instead of carrots, and I used 1 Tablespoon nonfat dry milk mixed with 1/2 cup 2 percent milk instead of the cream that I did not have. I love this soup either hot or cold and with or without a dollop of sour cream or Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che and will make it again especially for company. Also, I trimmed the ends and strings from the sugar snap peas before cooking."
128473,501674,2013/6/26,5,"What a great ice tea recipe Sharon.  I really enjoyed it.  I used fresh pineapple but I crushed it, worked really well in this recipe.  The hibiscus tea was wonderful mixed with the pink lemonade.  I loved it, great flavor, beautiful color and nice texture.  Thanks for sharing another wonderful drink recipe."
1802599188,522432,2015/6/27,5,Great recipe! I substituted garlic red wine vinegar since I was out of white wine vinegar and left the honey out. I also used more cilantro because we love it and can&#039;t get enough of it in our house. Great tip to add the avocado when serving! It doesn&#039;t get brown &amp; mushy plus people that don&#039;t like it don&#039;t have to pick it out since it&#039;s not already in there. This will definitely be made again.
724631,510375,2014/2/24,5,"Delightful, and easy.  I was impressed that the meatballs weren&#039;t overcooked.  Yes, I will definitely make these for a family potluck.  And I was sure to let DH express his approval before I disclosed the ingredients.  Right now he looks like a meatball, he ate so many.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game. Update on 12/15/13 review: we pulled some out of the freezer and they are so OMG good!  We hoped to find some frozen mashed potatoes for the event, so lesson learned."
1726708,534898,2018/4/4,5,"So delicious! I didn't stuff them, but I did dip them in butter before baking. AWESOME!"
1800323762,509734,2013/11/25,5,"Delicious chili! We just made it this weekend and it was so yummy!  It had just the right heat.  I just had some for lunch and it was so savory and warmed me right up.  I love the meat to beans ratio, it was such a hearty chili.  Definitely would recommend this chili to others."
1803198406,509734,2015/1/16,5,"The best chili I have ever tasted - perfect heat and the smokey flavor makes this really unique.  I have made this chili three times now, twice for work events, and both friends and co-workers rave about it and ask when I&#039;ll make it again.  The first time I made this, I used Bold Chachere&#039;s and it was a huge hit.  Tried Original Chachere&#039;s and found it a bit too salty for my tastes, so the third batch went back to Bold."
314579,527476,2016/7/26,5,"I grew up with lots of Filipino friends and in high school the Filipino Club always made money by selling lumpia for 50 cents each. I've always wanted to make them and Culinary Quest 2016 Philippines was the perfect time! I tried two different wrappers and do have a strong opinion! I bought really good spring roll wrappers and then found actual lumpia wrappers. I made a test batch with both. The spring roll wrappers are good, but much thicker and totally sufficient is that's all that available. If you live somewhere with a Filipino Market, buy real lumpia wrappers! Much thinner, but durable enough to wrap and fry. The crunch is so much better!!! The sauce is terrific. I even found Filipino vinegar for the sauce. 5 big stars Nan!! Thank you!!!"
945395,495633,2013/3/23,5,"YUM! This is better than anything I can get from the nearest takeout. Perfect marriage of flavors. I used red jalapeno peppers, and deboned chicken thigh meat that I&#039;d slow-simmered first in some of the marinade, which I made myself since I don&#039;t have a Piggly Wiggly near me (sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger paste, garlic paste, wasabi powder, a pinch of 5 spice, white pepper, and a little arrowroot powder). The pineapple and juice gave it just the right sweetness. I served it over jasmine rice and garnished it with chopped cilantro. I&#039;ll see if I can order some Newton Farms Ginger Wasabi Marinade for next time. Thanks Miss Fannie -- this is my favorite recipe of yours yet! Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2013."
498271,495633,2013/4/29,5,WOW this is a delicious chicken dish!  Easy to make and packed with flavor.  I made half of the recipe; I used Ginger People ginger peanut sauce and 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes for the red chilies.  Loved the combination of the sweet pineapple with the salty peanut and the spicy pepper.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
284897,495633,2013/6/21,5,"I had trouble finding any sesame and ginger marinade for this recipe, so I had to make my own, which I think may have not had as much flavour as a bought marinade may have had. &lt;br/&gt;I cut down on the chilli and added cashews instead of peanuts, and this turned out quick nicely, although I think it would have been a lot easier and a little tastier if I had used bought marinade.&lt;br/&gt;The family really liked it, but I am now on the look out for the marinade to make this wonderful recipe even easier.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Miss Fannie."
724631,495633,2014/2/14,5,"Great instant dinner, good change of pace!  We had 2 huge Perdue chicken breasts, so we sliced each into 2 filets, which worked out very well.  I sprayed the chicken breasts instead of the pan, and while waiting to flip, I sprayed the other side; I heartily recommend this approach!  Couldn&#039;t find the small red chili peppers, so used 1 large red jalapeno, which lent some noticeable heat, but not a lot.  I threw in some additional red bell pepper, didn&#039;t want to toss it. Used Lawry&#039;s Sesame &amp; Ginger Marinade, which I recommend, but I think I will try making my own marinade next time.   Use honey-roasted dry-roasted peanuts.  Served with Recipe #505471 #505471.  Made for Best of 2013 tag, based on loof&#039;s recommendation."
2001396148,529130,2017/2/18,5,"Made this last night &amp; it turned out perfectly. My steak wasn't quite 1.5 inches, and it cooked in 6 minutes total, so be ready with your meat thermometer. Beautiful crust using this method. I forgot to add garlic to the herb mix, and it was still great. Also, I used less butter because, well, that's a lot of dang butter."
112429,513024,2014/8/23,0,"Super quick and easy, nice texture in the batter. Watch your chili&#039;s. Be sure you don&#039;t use chili&#039;s hotter then your used to. Oh my I did not realize Big Jim Chili&#039;s were so hot!! Not the recipes fault, definitely the cooks."
597669,493195,2014/8/16,5,I make this using milk chocolate chips and low sugar seedless blackberry jam.  I also line the pan with foil and grease it  so I can lift bars out of the pan.  That makes cutting easier.
560491,504861,2013/10/26,5,"Great salad, I really loved the dressing.  I used green leaf lettuce (no spinach) and craisins instead of raisins.  Served for lunch and I liked it as is; DH sliced up some leftover grilled chicken and mixed it in.  Made for My Three Chefs."
169430,504861,2014/4/21,5,"I used red leaf lettuce for the spinach and skipped the cucumber. I used Splenda option. Honestly, I could happily make a meal of just this salad, YUM. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
242729,493924,2014/2/18,5,"This is just the sort of salad that Malcolm and I love, lots of grains with leaves, herbs and one of our favourite cheeses, Halloumi! I made it exactly as posted with the exception of the cherry tomatoes, I had none, so used normal tomatoes chopped small, and we were rewarded with an amazing and VERY filling bowl of salad for lunch. I used my own home-grown mint and some home-cooked chickpeas.Made for the Aussie Recipe Swap #85 and VERY much enjoyed with Malcolm giving it the full 5 stars!"
4439,520295,2015/1/5,5,I love rice. Did I say I love rice and am not supposed to eat b/c of the carbs. This is delicious. I used Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage but kept the rest of the recipe intact except for the Healthy Choice Cream of Mushroom Soup. I served it with Grilled Chicken Breasts and my chopped  salad recipe. Great recipe!!
2549237,498848,2013/4/26,4,"We really enjoyed this meatloaf!  The only thing that I have to say is that for someone who has never made a meatloaf you may need to tell them when to add the breadcrumb and spice mixture.  I love meatloaf and make it very often, so I knew when to do this.  Also, I can&#039;t comment on the authenticity of this recipe because I have never eaten at Boston Market, but my family loved it and I will use this recipe again in the future when we feel like a barbecue!  Thanks Pumpkin Pie&#039;s Mommy!  Made for New Kids On The Block Tag Game."
865936,503814,2013/8/15,4,"This was quick and easy and tasty too!  The dish is a little sweet for our tastes (not the fault of the recipe, the fault of our palettes), so next time I would use less sugar.  I did enjoy the subtle nuances of flavors from the spices."
2171229,494609,2013/2/8,5,Sounds great.  Yum.
2200921,494609,2013/2/8,0,very original love it
551329,502112,2013/6/25,5,"Wow!  This was great.  Light and fresh and perfect for summer.  Don&#039;t skimp on the fresh corn, the fresh taste and crunchy texture are what makes this recipe.  It&#039;s really pretty, too. Colorful."

560491,506943,2013/10/6,4,Very quick and easy!  Made with leftover grilled chicken and whole grain pasta.  I love avocado and this was a tasty salad to use it in.  Made for My Three Chefs Tag.
296809,506943,2015/1/15,5,"The main beauty of a pasta salad is its flexability. They are multi-generational, ingredient-friendly &amp; make-ahead easy-fixes - Popular for almost all occasions - And easily expand to allow for personal preferences. This one was near-perfect for us. I added black olives &amp; was good-to-go. Served w/fruit only, it made a great dinner meal &amp; I esp liked that it did not require any mayo that is common to most pasta salads. Congrats on another Football Pool win &amp; thx for sharing this recipe w/us."

67728,509672,2014/4/24,5,"Fantastic veggie burgers! I&#039;ll eat meat-based burgers, but definitely as a fairly infrequent guilty pleasure. I&#039;ve always liked veggie burgers, because then it&#039;s the burger experience minus the guilt, and I just enjoy the taste of them. I think these veggie burgers are in my top three faves (in the company of Dr. Praeger&#039;s California Veggie burgers and Cheesecake Factory&#039;s version). I used short-grain brown rice in this (the ingredient list says jasmine rice, but the instructions say brown rice). The seasonings might seem like a lot when they&#039;re being added, but I thought they were perfect in the finished product. These do have a little bit of a spice kick from the chili powder, but not too bad (much less so than your average bowl of chili). I found the mixture to be a litte too squishy once fully assembled, so I added in approximately 1/2 cup additional breadcrumbs to give these more body. I did add one can of corn kernels, drained and patted dry -- the more, the merrier when it comes to veggies! I didn&#039;t measure the mixture while I was forming the patties, just kind of eyeballed them, but I ended up with 12 good-sized thick patties. I cooked them on the stovetop using my ridged grill pan, which I misted with olive oil before frying. Even with the extra breadcrumbs, the burgers were still pretty delicate when raw. I had the best luck when I added the patties to the hot pan, then left them alone for about 6 or 7 minutes before flipping them. They&#039;re still far softer than meat-based burgers once cooked, but I suppose that us veggie burger eaters are used to that. Because of the mashed black beans in these, the fully cooked burgers might appear a bit charred, but no worries  -- they don&#039;t taste burnt. DH is kind of a chicken about new and different foods, so I&#039;m not sure that I will get him to try these, but I think I might wrap these up and put them in the freezer so can take them out and bring them to work for dinner as needed. I actually enjoyed one for dinner tonight, done up with  Pepperidge Farm sliced bread, ketchup, pickles, sliced tomato, lettuce and Havarti cheese. Very happy with these, thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
126440,509672,2014/4/28,4,"Great flavors but will need to add more rice, breadcrumbs or oats to keep them from falling apart.&lt;br/&gt;Loved the Mexican flare and did add Mexican oregano."
2000634719,509672,2015/11/2,4,"Too many unnecessary steps for a quick weeknight meal, so after smashing beans, I just mixed everything together. Also, I needed to add 1/4 more rice/oats/crumbs so they wouldn&#039;t fall apart. I&#039;m on a mission to feed my meat loving family less meat and they LOVED them. My 9 yr old, added a dollop of sour cream to temper the spice. Saut&eacute;ed in butter and served salsa and salad on the side."
2000128719,521679,2015/4/9,5,Great recipe.. I made this following the instructions and recipe... it was so delicious..
2000128742,521679,2015/4/9,5,"I tried it in my kitchen and it was yummy....:) 
Can you please post more recipes...."
2000142031,521679,2015/4/15,0,The recipe doesn&#039;t list how much chicken to use
2000720121,521679,2015/11/29,3,"The recipe  is hard to follow making the marinade it says to add soy sauce, cornstarch and eggs. Later it says add soy sauce and all ingredients to the wok. It also says to add water to the corn starch that you added in the marinade and it doesn&#039;t tell you how much water to add. Finally the picture shown looks dry.. Mine not so much. Please rewrite the directions to make sense"
2209000,494609,2013/2/14,5,Cool recipe!
1359842,495152,2013/2/17,5,I want some now! Yum!
8292302,508353,2014/8/28,5,"This is an easy recipe to make and it smelled beautifully fragrant while it was cooking. I didn&#039;t have a vanilla bean, but I did have vanilla bean paste so I substituted a teaspoon for the bean and also I only used about an inch and a half of ginger. It has a delicate flavor and I think it will be perfect paired with some nice French Brie and a baguette. I am going to make more, as I think it will make perfect gifts for the holiday for my family and friends."
1801066410,508353,2015/10/10,5,"Such a wonderfully delicate flavour. We decided to go with this recipe over other because of the added ingredient (ginger, vanilla &amp; cinnamon). A few minor substitutions: 3 Tbsp of vanilla, 2 Tbsp of pre-grated ginger. Still, amazing. We got 9 250ml jars from our batch (sadly, one was lost in the water bath)."
2001122430,508353,2017/8/3,0,"I am going to recommend this recipe for several reasons: - there is not much sugar in it (most recipe call for a lot more) - adding ginger, cinnamon, vanilla.... yum! - no pectin is used So, it sounds like a very healthy recipe to me! Only one question though: why use &quot;bottled&quot; lemon juice when the freshly squeezed kind is much better: most people don't realize that bottle lemon juice contains sulfites, one of the many triggers of asthma. Thank you for sharing!"
2002299017,508353,2018/10/12,0,"@Sulfite-free. Many canning recipes call for bottled lemon juice because it has a higher acidity than some commercial lemons. For water bath canning of tomatoes, even unripe tomatoes, acidity is critical. I think you can make this safely using fresh lemon juice by adding citric acid. How much? I would use the amount recommended on most citric acid bottles (follow instructions for canning tomatoes)."
542159,501893,2013/6/25,5,"This is heaven in a salad bowl! This salad has boundless flavors and crunch as well as being so filling. I cut the recipe in half and doubled the romaine lettuce, also cut my cherry tomatoes in half as they were kind of big and used homemade croutons (a bit smaller than those big store bought ones that cut your mouth up). I served with some kamlamata olive French bread and wine making a meal fit for a king or queen (wink). I think if making for gest will bring to table in either clear bowl or large flat bowl undressed and dress at the table as it was quite pretty before the dressing was added. Thanks for the 10 star post."

286566,493903,2013/7/5,4,"I really liked the concept of using the oatmeal and the baking, I did give them a light spray with cooking oil before putting the into a 200C fan forced oven but to get them to the browned stage took 25 minutes and they were dry and a little tough so would not to flatten out the tenders so they are plump and hopefully will brown up without going dry.

They&#039;re good, but I don&#039;t get any of the wasabi flavor... I think they were actually better before I added the dry ingredients. I just got a bitter note from the wasabi.

I didn&#039;t have any arrowroot or potato starch so I used some baking powder.  Also didn&#039;t have any yellow squash so I used a grey zucchini and a green zucchini. I also added some vegetable stock for a liquid component. The changes worked well in your recipe, I did garnish with the green onions and avocado, so good.

Much easier than as written, and I&#039;ve added a star!&lt;br/&gt;Original review 03/09/14:  This recipe was very time consuming.  I thought the egg caused the filling to be an unusual texture, and IMHO the filling lacked in flavor ~ maybe a bit of salt would make it less bland?

I didn&#039;t make meatballs but left the meat loose. The sauce was very juicy not at all like the one pictured - 2 Tbls tomato paste to 3 cups of broth even cooked down doesn&#039;t get very thick. I added a little more paste and used beef broth instead of chicken and to give the sauce a little more body I added a little heavy cream at the end.

The sauce that they simmer in is outstanding. I could eat that up as a soup! I used the larger pearled couscous so the meatballs would have something more substantial to rest upon. The couscous was yummy, too, with just the right amount of cinnamon. I just cooked up the whole box and kept the addition amounts the same. Yum! I cut the recipe in half and it fed two people easily, with a a little leftover. Note: I did end up doubling the tomato paste amount because I wanted my sauce on the thicker side.

133174,505050,2014/3/29,5,Excellent!  I did not make the couscous.  The meatballs were made using ground turkey.  The hardest part is adding in all the spices.  This was served over steamed brown rice and served with parmesan roasted tomatoes.

58104,495794,2013/4/3,3,This breakfast taco was good. I used 2 eggs instad of 3. Upped the cabbage(Napa my choice). Used less dressing. I also used reall crabmeat. Just don`t like the imitation crab.  I would use flour tortillas because the corn tortillas fell apart. Some heat from jalapenos or pepper flakes would have been nice. Makes plenty for 6.

The only thing different from the recipe is that I did not have fresh parsley, so I was going to use 1/2 as much dried... but I forgot. No big deal, the salt, pepper and garlic flavor were plenty for these. I will definitely make these again. Thank you for posting your recipe. (Made for PRMR)"
226863,499188,2014/3/12,5,"These were great!  Less oily than I thought they would be and cooked much faster than I expected.  I&#039;ve never had Gilroy fries, so don&#039;t know how they compare, but I really enjoyed them!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Zaar Stars tag game."

461834,505870,2016/8/1,5,"Loved this bread!! I made this exactly as written, except I added a bit of toasted pecans and based on another review, I added a heaping 1/2 cup of sugar, but feel I probably would have been happy with just the 1/2 cup. I had unsweetened flaked coconut, that was easily toasted in the oven in less than 5 minutes and made the house smell wonderful. I had a slice warm out of the oven with some butter and then later I toasted a slice to go with my brunch and both ways were delicious!! Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for Quest 2016."

47892,505870,2016/8/6,4,I made this bread as two small loaves in parchment-lined mini loaf pans. Half of the granulated sugar was replaced with dark brown sugar and I also added 1/4 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. Half of the banana was subbed with coconut milk to give a more tropical flavor. I used coconut oil for &quot;cooking&quot; oil and the final 10 minutes of baking garnished the top of the loaf with grated coconut. Enjoyed for teatime yesterday. Prepared for CQ3.
542159,505870,2016/8/7,5,"A moist tasty bread that rose so much it hit the heating element in my little oven lol. The toasted coconut does add a delightful flavor and texture to this nice bread, which is not overly sweet but is sweet enough to be very satisfying. I made using 3 bananas and could not find canned coconut so toasted 3 ounces unsweetened coconut and used a very heaping &frac12; cup sugar to offset the not having sweetened coconut. Bottom line we liked and will be making again, thanks for the post."
169430,493028,2013/3/23,0,"This turned out to be a bit of a project. I didn&#039;t read the part about the Kitchen Aid restriction until I got there (D&#039;oh) so I just lowered the speed and hoped for the best. Clearly, my result seems to prove that it needs to be done at the recommended speed. The bread that I ended up with didn&#039;t rise as much as I would have liked and had a very dense heavy texture. I don&#039;t fault the recipe in any way but instead it was my own lack reading the entire recipe before beginning. Hopefully this has taught me to be a better recipe reader. I&#039;m sure that if you have a mixer brand that will operate as required you will have a lovely bread. Made for Pic A Chef, Spring 2013."
1632312,493028,2017/9/10,5,"Turned out perfectly! The first time I made this recipe I used gluten that was a couple of years out of date, but yesterday I used brand new gluten and attached is a photo of the result. It is the best wheat bread I've ever been able to produce. It is actually soft and light. I have a Kitchen Aid and I only used #2 speed for a couple of minutes and then turned it down to the lowest speed with the dough hook and it was perfect."
204024,503239,2013/9/22,5,"Nothing fancy, but a hit with our family! We love Bush&#039;s beans already and hadn&#039;t tried Applewood bacon, but basically this just combines two quality components into one nice, hearty dish. Works here!"
2000505323,498909,2015/9/29,5,Oh my goodness!! This recipe is AMAZING!!! I whipped it up tonight. I didn&#039;t have fresh parsley available so I subbed it with cilantro. My daughter and I are in HEAVEN. It was great. I will have to try it again with parsley next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Our tummies thank you. I still have some calories left. WOOHOO!!
679953,503669,2013/12/15,5,"Great breakfast.  Made these for breakfast, cutting recipe in half, using some powdered sugar, and maple syrup.  Nice and easy to make, and the kids especially dove into these.  Went well with some French toast.  Made for your win in Football Pool  Week 10."
280026,503669,2014/6/29,2,Not overly impressed.  Skin was soft and flavorless after frying.  Didn&#039;t add much to the dish.

I didn&#039;t have leftover shrimp (what&#039;s that?? lol! ),  but just let my shrimp poach in the sauce,  we both agreed that this was a definite do-again, a lovely supper dish with all the satisfaction of curry and none of the time and labour :)       My usual inclination is to serve curry on rice, in this case DH requested spaghetti :-O but you  know what?  it was quite nice, actually! ;)   Thank you Pammy, made and enjoyed for PRMR tag game."
895132,508581,2013/11/9,5,"Yum! Easy, quick and soo yummy! I didn&#039;t have leftover shrimps either, but who minds LOL Followed the recipe to the letter except that I used greek sheep yoghurt in place of the sour cream.

128473,528068,2016/9/22,5,"I really enjoyed this tasty pita sandwich Lori. It was so good. Tender, sweet and flavorful. The pita was crisp and sweet, just perfect for the delicious apple filling. I will be enjoying this often my friend. Made for FTT Game"
2002040290,528276,2018/3/9,0,"Not bad! Not my favourite mug cake but I was really craving a funfetti cake and this is pretty satisfying. Microwaved 1min30sec then added 30sec and it was fine, but blob of buttercream in middle of cake exploded over cake making it look less pretty, and made the base of the cake liquidy."
2680073,494698,2013/2/6,4,"Delicious, never would have though pizza and muffins could mix, but they do so wonderfully.  Still tastes like a muffin, with a slight pizza aftertaste with a little zip provided by the pepperonis.  Great treat!"

133174,495553,2013/7/18,4,The recipe was downsized to 2 servings and was baked in individual ramekins.  It was mixed and placed in the refrigerator to set for a few hours prior to baking.  After 30 minutes in the oven the puddings were cooked through.  They are very rich and will satisfy your chocolate cravings.  I had hoped for a little more sauce than was produced but overall very tasty.  Made for ZWT and the Bread N&#039;awlins Style Challenge.
560491,495553,2013/7/21,4,"This was a good recipe.  For ME, bread pudding does not sound appetizing; it is the soft/soggy texture of the bread that gets me.  Since this had chocolate in it I thought I would give it a try for DH (chocoholic) and I; I was pleasantly surprised.  I used French bread and Ghirardelli white and bittersweet chips.  I let it soak for 8 hours and baked my serving for 2 in a gratin dish for 30 minutes.  it came out moist and custard-y, not soggy.  of course we think it could of used more chocolate but still had a good flavor.  Made for ZWT9- Bread N&#039;awlins Style."
67728,495553,2013/7/22,5,"Very tasty! The downside of this is that there is nothing saucy about it, so I was a teensy bit disappointed when I took it from the oven, after reading the name and all.  The disappointment passed quickly once I tasted it, though! I generally like bread pudding, but sometimes it&#039;s too eggy. This wasn&#039;t eggy at all. It was drier than most bread puddings I&#039;ve tried, but not in a bad way. It really reminded me of a Toll House pan cookie, actually. I used a loaf of brioche, chopped bittersweet Scharffen-Berger squares and some Whole Foods brand white chocolate chunks (too lazy to chop up the hunk of Callebaut in the cabinet). I made a mistake when adding the cream -- apparently my reading comprehension was set for low when making this. My milk had given up the ghost, so I used just the cream. I didn&#039;t realize until it was too late that I was supposed to divide the cream, though, so I added all the cream to the bread and chocolate mixture (plus the 1/2 cup extra to make up for the missing milk :shock: ). I let this sit in the fridge overnight, and then I still added 1/2 cup of cream to the top right before baking. Oh, and I used a packet of Dr. Oetker&#039;s Vanilla Sugar for the topping, just because I could. Even with all the extra cream in this, there was still no sauce to be found, but I didn&#039;t care! This is lovely served warm with a bit of sweetened whipped cream. Thanks for posting, Sofie! Made by a fellow Hot Pink Panther for ZWT9"
92006,495553,2016/8/12,5,"This was so good! I made half the amount, and now I regret it. I let it rest for about 3 hours and then I baked it. Maybe next time I'll add some chocolate sauce on top, and there will be a next time! Thank you for sharing! Made for CQ '16."
1802617989,514516,2014/3/25,5,Very good soup!!  I will make this over and over again!!

126440,507330,2014/1/8,5,Great change of pace for breakfast.  Made it yesterday but put a slice in the microwave for 15 sec. and it was wonderful.

2549237,499494,2013/6/19,3,"Okay, So apparently the food.com people are not going to let me review and post a picture to this at the same time.  I keep getting notes that say that my review/photo were not approved.  We liked the taste of this Breakfast Pie, however even after following the direction precisely and allowing to sit in the fridge for 10 hours the pie didn&#039;t set up.  Ours came out super runny.  I think that maybe adding a little flour or cornstarch could help to remedy this.  I will experiment and try to figure it out.  Thanks for sharing diner524.  Made for Photo Tag although my photo won&#039;t post!  Sorry.  :("
2597942,499494,2014/1/1,5,"We just enjoyed this for our &quot;New Years Day&quot; breakfast. I must confess that I was a bit nervous. I assembled it after midnight last night. I did not measure out the bacon grease after removing the lardons. I just dumped all of it over the corn flakes and mixed. The other hesitation I had was that I do not like cottage cheese, but I figured it was such a small amount that I wouldn&#039;t notice it, so I used it. I was correct. It added a bit of creaminess to the filling. I used the frozen, shredded hash browns, but I thawed them and patted off any excess moisture, so that my casserole wouldn&#039;t be runny. It turned out great! I would just say that I may adjust the seasonings next time (for our own personal taste). I don&#039;t know if it makes a difference, but I did not use a glass (Pyrex) or aluminum pie pan. I used a 9&quot; round, shallow Corning-ware casserole dish. This fed 3 adults (2 being large men) with a bit left over. Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)."
296809,499494,2014/10/26,5,"Made for your Football Pool win - DH &amp; I host a wkly family brunch on Sat morning. However many family members walk together while I cook &amp; they end up here for brunch. I&#039;m never sure how many there will be &amp; try to vary the menu so no one gets bored. Icelanders revere potatoes, so this was very well-rec&#039;d. The frozen potato hash I get here is great for this dish (very small potato dice w/chopped onion). I did chg the topping. DH felt the price of the corn flakes was outrageous &amp; didn&#039;t get them, so I subbed the Icelandic equivalent of Durkee&#039;s crisp fried onions &amp; it worked well. Congrats on your FP win &amp; thx for sharing this recipe w/us."

2000545062,534321,2017/12/22,5,"I’ve made these before and they are excellent! Just make sure you cut them right away. Not sure why I didn’t but it was definitely a mistake. Also if you are on a low salt (no added salt) diet, these are just as tasty if you have to cut back."

679953,503126,2013/12/5,5,Very nice.  I could taste the brown sugar in these.  made for a lunch snack for DS and I.  Didn&#039;t change a thing .  Made as directed.  Made for Holiday Tag.
47892,503126,2014/2/9,5,These are very good but *very* rich! I liked that little bit of sweetness from the brown sugar. We served ours with ranch dip. I had to skip the green onions and replace with onion powder so that 6-year old ~Tasty Dish~ would try these. I set aside a small bowl of ranch dip with green onions stirred in for mine and husband&#039;s hush puppies. Made for Best of 2013.
2694963,494372,2013/2/15,5,excellent idea. full of flavor and the chicken stays very moist
2701435,494372,2013/2/19,4,I am always looking for new ideas for chicken.  This was great.  The kids loved it and it stayed super moist.  This chef has some great ideas.  Keep em coming.
204024,505587,2013/8/25,5,This made a great early dinner for us.   It was fun trying new stuff like lemongrass and fish sauce.  Made for ZWT9 Hot Stuff.
2000079359,505587,2015/3/22,2,"Needs at least 2% salt. the water and milk needs to be coconut milk. Red curry paste should be added about 8%.
The chicken should be boneless thighs with skin on."
340141,508040,2013/11/21,5,"The best black bean dish I&#039;ve ever had.   Black beans aren&#039;t a favorite of mine, but you&#039;d never know it from how delicious this dish turned out.   It was smoky and savory; the orange juice and particularly zest really lifted it above the ordinary bean soup."
486725,508040,2014/3/7,4,"The coffee and orange lend a nice complexity to this. I found that I made my coffee a little too strong, so added a pinch of sugar to each bowl. Neither of us are that big of ham fans, so we topped the soup with crisped prosciutto instead, and it went well with it. I bet smoked paprika and/or chipotle powder would be right at home with the smokiness of these flavors. Served 6 for us."
1535,516391,2014/10/14,5,"My family LOVED these. I like the fact that they are so easy to prepare ahead of time and then bake right before serving. My box of taco shells had 12 shells in it. I don&#039;t know if they were smaller than shells that come in a box of 8, but I had no problem filling all 12. I used petite diced tomatoes to balance out the size of the tomatoes with the beans and meat pieces. I thought it worked well. We added salsa, sour cream and shredded lettuce to them after they were baked. They are already on the menu again!"
2597942,500258,2013/5/15,5,"This recipe is spot on! This is the exact way that JJ&#039;s makes them. I know they make their own rolls, but Walmart has great french rolls in their bakery section that are just fine by me! My hubby, DD, DS and I had these for lunch. Mine look no-where near as pretty as JJ&#039;s commercials, but tasted delicious! I&#039;m not sure of the exact ounces used on the sandwiches, so just &#039;eye-ball&#039; it. Be sure to use the Dijon and mayo, and make sure to use the deli shaved meats and thinly slice the veggies. I omitted tomatoes and added sliced onion to mine (personal preference). This is a &#039;must try at home&#039; for anyone that is a JJ&#039;s fan (it is much cheaper, and very easy to make). Thanks for posting the info. (Made for New Kids tag game)"
2002179100,500258,2018/6/8,4,"You can replicate the club easily, however, it lacks the quality and speed of the original. Jimmy John's only takes 30 seconds of cook time, and their roast beef literally has Kick Ass written on it. They cut veggies, cook bread, and slice meats daily to provide a freshness envied by other sandwich shops. It can be mimiked, but unlike other fast food restaurants, it won't be quite as tasty."
2597942,495957,2013/3/15,5,"Too stinking cute!!! Made these tonight and it was kind of fun (like being a little kid again). I made half the batch called for. Mine don&#039;t look at all picture perfect... but our 1 yr old grandson &quot;oogled&quot; at them from below the counter top as Nana Rosie was trying to get a clear, bright photo, and then he devoured them as soon as I clicked the photo. The first 5 ingredients on the list are what I normally use in my deviled eggs (usually along with some minced up onion and soft bacon bits). So I used onion slices for the ears. I wish I would have had capers on hand for the eyes and nose, but I didn&#039;t so I had to improvise. (Eeewww, the thought of using mini chocolate chips in a deviled egg just made me shiver!) I used diced carrots for the nose and chives for the whiskers (no celery on hand either). On half of them I used bacon bits for the eyes (since I mix them into it anyways) and the rest of them I used diced jalapeno (hubby likes hot stuff). I will definitely be making this again for Easter. I&#039;m even trying to brainstorm as to how I could make half of them look like baby chicks (maybe &quot;fluffier&quot; with a nicely carved carrot beak and celery heart leaves for feet protruding out?). LOL I think this recipe is very versatile and can be used to let your imagination go (be a kid again). Thank you for posting this recipe. It was so much fun to make.

2001261602,511012,2016/11/22,5,Love Love this.....it is also called Mississippi Sin Dip. You will be the hit of the party or tailgate. Cook it longer...needs to be hot all the way through. We did the real bacon pieces by Hormel ...they were perfect and I didn't have to make a mess frying bacon. Serve with a thicker cracker so it doesn't crumble...Like Wheat Thins or a whole wheat mini Club cracker stick. Enjoy
2001375223,511012,2017/2/2,5,This is one of the best dips I've ever had! The sweet in the glaze makes the cheese and bacon flavors pop. Serve with Frito Scoops!
2200124,495152,2013/2/13,5,Delicious!!!!
2414156,495152,2013/2/16,5,Wonderful Flavor!
679953,495329,2013/3/4,3,"These were okay.  Had a couple issues with the ingredients, and the instructions.  I did use the black-eyed peas, but in the instuctions it mentioned the bean mixture.  The ketchup/barbecue sauce combination worked out well, also just thought this could of used some seasonings.  Good luck in the contest."
2201427,495152,2013/2/18,5,"What a great pizza recipe!!  The combination of Alfredo sauce, spinach and ground pork was the BEST!!  Thanks for sharing!"

251917,505708,2014/1/29,5,Aussie Swap#84: I loved this salad! I love the savory combination of the rice vinegar and chili sauce! A delicious departure from the creamy cuke salad I normally make!
128473,505708,2014/4/29,4,"Thank you for sharing this recipe Bethie.  It was quick and easy to make.  A nice change from the usual cucumber salads that we eat.   We found this to be flavorful with a soft texture.  I would use less soya sauce next time, it kind of overpowered the other flavors for us. I used mini cucumbers in this recipe."
2715535,495315,2013/3/1,5,My momma loves Pepsi and now I can make her a Pepsi cake. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
99254,495315,2013/3/1,3,"The cake part of this recipe was absolutely fabulous! Moist and very flavorful and there was nothing ""off"" about the flavor. However I could smell the ketchup in the icing and it overwhelmed the chocolate. I couldn't get past smell in order to eat more than one piece. I will make this again, but will omit the ketchup in the frosting."
2002215325,532257,2018/7/11,4,"Good recipe. I think it is missing fenugreek to have the &quot;right&quot; japanese &quot;S&amp;J&quot; canned flavor. Notes: [1] KEEPS WELL if tightly bottled in a recycled spice glass bottle. [2] CUMIN is a bit high. I doubled the batch, didn't use on 2nd batch, then mixed the two together to &quot;halve it&quot;. [3] If you can afford the time, start with whole fennel seeds and whole coriander seeds. Toast them in a dry, small skillet on HIGH heat. Takes awhile. They'll begin to crackle and smoke a bit. Keep stirring until you see a barely noticeable browning on the seeds. Transfer to a cool dish or dinner plate, let cool down. (Transferring prevents scorching) [4] Put ALL spices, whole and ground into a tornado-type coffee/spice grinder. Grind, and grind, and grind. Then use a small wire sieve to get the powder from the chaff. This is what you bottle and use. GoatGuy July 11 2018"
379153,496948,2014/10/15,0,What are the vegetables in this recipe??
1803307933,512675,2014/11/9,5,"I tried this soup on Halloween night, and I could not stop eating it.  My only regret is that my stomach was not bigger to accommodate more of that warm, cheesy goodness.  Absolutely scrumptious."
1802952514,514138,2014/7/21,4,There cookies taste good but I gave it only 4 stars because the cookies are flat.
2399085,512195,2014/2/1,5,Made for PRMR!!! These were really good. Whats not to like about a kabob? It says spicy but it really isn&#039;t that bad on heat. great KABOB!!! Thanks
37636,512195,2014/7/23,4,"These  are very tasty and simple to make. Perfect for weekday grilling since they grill up quickly. I think if I were entertaining and served these, something like a yogurt chipotle dip would be very nice and set them over the top. Reviewed for the &quot;For your consideration&quot; tag game."
128473,512195,2015/4/30,5,We enjoyed these delicious mini kebabs very much.  They were  so flavorful.  The meat was tender and juicy.  Crunchy on the outside just the way we like our BBQ.  These little babies were ready in no time.  Thank you for sharing this recipe that was quick and easy to make with terrific results. Served with a drizzle of Homemade Pomegranate Reduction Sauce and coconut cashew rice for a memorable meal.  Made FYC Tag Game.
305531,512195,2015/5/29,5,"Yum! These were super simple and really tasty. Loved the flavors in the marinade. I let mine marinate overnight and they were delish. Thanks for sharing, Teresa. Made for FYC tag."
1802849661,528059,2016/12/1,5,We loved these!! Made a lovely change to &quot;normal&quot; fajitas with beef or chicken. Love all the veg in there too; these were great!
107583,502706,2013/8/24,5,Great recipe.  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Great flavors and the fruit is a nice &quot;side&quot;.  Made for ZWT 9.
1925885,522853,2015/8/3,5,"Oh my goodness - this is good!  Just whipped this honey up this afternoon and it says to wait five days to use it. Really? I&#039;m not sure it&#039;ll make it through the resting period!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except leaving out the cloves and lemon zest. The finished honey is thick &amp; glossy, and the ginger shines through with a little burn. Just PERFECT!    Made for Culinary Quest 2015 by a Toasted Tourist."
107135,522853,2015/8/8,5,wowser love this  cherry bombers
542159,522853,2016/7/19,5,"Oh can think of so many uses for this that would lead to a lot more of me lol. This is good when first prepared (12 minutes start to finish), but even better when given the 5 day rest period. I made this using 3 cloves, cinnamon sticks and lemon zest. Served day one on vanilla yogurt and day 5 in chamomile tea, thanks so much for the post. P.S. don’t think ours will last 2 weeks."
1052873,522853,2016/7/23,5,Easy and tasty. I misread it and added garlic instead of cloves! Also good. Asian-y honey.
1621197,506885,2013/12/17,5,"This was very good! I left out the oregano (personal preference) and added more garlic. It was REALLY thick, so I had to work on the consistency. The end result was a really delicious dinner that the whole family enjoyed. Thank you!!!"
653438,497659,2013/4/11,5,Made for Spring PAC 2013 and this is another winner!  DH really enjoyed his lunch...yummm was all he said.  I did cut the recipe in half and used more onions (I love onions) but otherwise followed the instructions. Served with a side of garlic bread.  Thank you again for a wonderful meal.  Definately will make this again.
296809,504640,2013/8/4,5,"Made as written for a fellow Goddess &amp; ZWT-9 -- Our guests tonight were very impressed w/your dessert! This custard is light as air &amp; has the perfect level of sweetness. Since your intro allowed for chg&#039;ing the fruit &amp; DH is diet-restricted from raisins, I opted to use sml bits of well-drained pineapple &amp; the flavor was outstanding! I had to cook it about 10 min more than stated to be comfortable that it was fully set -- A more shallow baking dish may have reduced the cook time or perhaps the pineapple added extra moisture. I dusted it w/powdered sugar &amp; used fresh mint from my SIL&#039;s garden as a garnish. Thx for sharing this lovely dessert recipe w/us. :-)"
8629,511000,2014/9/21,4,"The salad  ingredients are the same as Portillo&#039;s Chopped salad. The dressing is a very good tasting balsamic vinegar dressing.  Portillo&#039;s chopped salad dressing, however, does not look like this dressing. This recipe&#039;s dressing does work with the salad ingredients. I&quot;m glad I made it."
2000156402,511000,2015/4/21,4,I have made this recipe a couple of times and it is very close to Portillo&#039;s chopped salad.  It is very good and we really enjoy it!
227367,511000,2018/6/24,5,Made this for lunch for the Garage Sale Crew at Church. Very well received! I used White Balsamic instead of the regular. I doubled the recipe to feed a crowd. I used 1 and 1/2 heads of romaine and 1 head of iceberg. I added a can of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans and 2 cups of chopped celery. Great recipe!
542159,500473,2013/6/1,5,"Appetizing dish that is easily transformed from a meat roll into a grilled sandwich thus eliminating heating the house during the hot months. What I did was to grill the chicken breast and some nice thick sliced whole grain bread. I guessed at the amount of chives used (listed in description and directions but not in the ingredients) when making the cream cheese mixture which I spread onto the grilled bread, added the olives and then spinach. Next I topped with the chicken and sprinkled with the parmesan cheese. Very quick and easy lunch or dinner for a 100+ day, thanks for the post."
679953,500473,2013/6/6,5,"What a nice quick little dinner.  I did add some onion to these, and as for the chicken I pan fryed it. I just used a small bit of chives.   Made for a great dinner, and loved the simplicity of these.  Served with some  chesse fries,for a great meal.  made for PRMR Tag."

37449,505119,2013/8/12,5,"I thoroughy enjoyed this coffee this morning as a treat, adjusting the ingredients to my needs. I did scale the recipe down for one person. Loved the allspice and coconut cream. :D Made for ZWT 2013 Coffee Challenge for the Caribbean. Thanks!"
383346,505119,2013/8/12,4,The taste of the rum and coconut cream with the coffee is so good.  But it was a little bit too sweet so next time I will omit the sugar.  Thanks Annacia :)  Made for ZWT9
895132,505119,2013/8/13,5,"Son of a gun, that was hot stuff! Made as written, except that I reduced the rum to one tablespoon - I don&#039;t do well with coffee and alcohol in the same cup. As my coconut cream and whipped cream aren&#039;t sweetened, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar and it was perfect for me. Thanks for sharing this treat!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Coffee Challenge for the Caribbean for The Apron String Travelers"
17803,505119,2013/8/13,4,"This was tasty, even if rum is not my favorite liquor.  I made mine into ice coffee, as written.  I&#039;ll add a little more sugar next time.   I only used 1/2 teaspoon since I did not want it to sweet.   Made for team Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9 2013"
461834,505119,2013/8/13,5,"I am out of town, getting my DD re-settled in for her 1st semester back at college this year.  We went out to dinner last night and instead of getting a dessert, we stopped at the bar.  I asked the bartender to make this coffee drink for me and he happily agreed.  I wasn&#039;t sure if a shot equaled 2 tablespoons or not, but that is what he added to the coffee, I had him add a packet of Equal and then add the cream to meet my desired creaminess, lol!!  This was delicious and didn&#039;t even miss a dessert!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
482376,505119,2013/8/13,5,"I love coffee and I love rum. It combined well here. I used less sugar because I don&#039;t like my coffee too sweet. I really like the spice addition. All I had in the fridge was a non-dairy whipped topping, which I used. It all worked out well. Thanks for creating! Made for the team Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9 in the Express Weekend #2."
128473,505119,2014/3/21,5,"Wow, another winner from Annacia the Coffee Queen. I really enjoyed this tasty treat.  Made exactly as written but scaled it down for one.  I did add additional sugar, I like my coffee sweet.  Loved the way the coconut cream, whipped cream and allspice blended with the rum and coffee.  It was superb .  I even used the last of my Blue Mountain Coffee the kids brought back from Jamaica for me.  Will have to ask them to pick up more, so that I can make this again.  Thanks so much for sharing this memorable coffee my friend."
37285,510514,2016/4/2,5,These are so delicious!! My son even likes the leftover buns in his lunch the next day. They are gooey scrumtious.  Great recipe!!!
2123645,532637,2018/4/15,5,Fantastic recipe! The only recommendation I have is to add a little salt to the zoodles. Love the chicken marinade and the bruschetta mixture. I used green onions instead of red onion for a milder taste.
2002268725,532637,2018/9/7,0,"I don't eat zucchini raw, so how long/how should I prepare the &quot;Zoodles?&quot;"
724631,509358,2013/11/24,3,"Please see my review system.  Although the filling tasted exquisite -- a perfect blend of seasonings, the recipe produced 9 cups of filling but my pie pan only took 4 1/2 cups.  At the very least, a deep dish pie pan is needed.  DH will be so happy that I will make a second pot pie for him.  I used Recipe#483999 for the pie crust.  So next time I would halve the filling amounts.  Please let me know if the recipe is adjusted so I may amend my review. Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
383346,509358,2014/2/28,5,This chicken pie is so yummy.  I made one big pie.  I piled it high.  That&#039;s how I like my chicken pot pie.  Without enough of good things in it.  The only difference I did was to use canned corn that I drained and also butter instead of margarine.  Wonderful taste.  Thanks nochlo :)  Made for PRMR tag game
212609,509358,2014/4/8,0,"YES-this is a delightful pie....even the children ate it without a single complaint ( and they are more into gravy pies, than white sauce type pies.)&lt;br/&gt;I made my own shortcrust pastry, used tinned sweetcorn, and as we don&#039;t have 1/2 and 1/2 here I used skimmed milk.&lt;br/&gt;I also par boiled my potatoes for a few minutes, before I sauteed them off with the other veg, just to ensure that they cooked through.&lt;br/&gt;Wonderfully warming and satisfying....and totally delicious!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks nochlo....Made for PRMR."

126440,513531,2014/4/13,5,Loved this served over Ciabatta bread.  Had to make two changes because of what I had on hand.  1 Jalape&ntilde;o for the green pepper and Rotel for the plum tomatoes.  Loved it with baked fries.

496803,503340,2013/7/26,5,"Yummy!  I had to play with the ingredients a little, as I found out I was out of milk just as I reached for it.  So, I skipped making the roux and just thickened some heavy cream and added the mustard and cayenne to it, then served over toasted country bread.  I love how this dish emphasizes the beautiful golden color of my backyard chicken egg yolks.  This would make a spectacular brunch dish :)  Made for ZWT9"
20480,503340,2014/12/16,5,This was one recipes I grew up with and so did my kids. I did add dijon and it was perfetion. Thank you for the memories.
461834,503878,2013/7/15,5,"Wow is this good!!!  I made this as written but subbing Triple Sec for the Cointreau liqueur and then topped it off with a slice of orange and a cherry.  The first taste was pretty strong, really tasted the brandy but then in the back of my throat I had a wonderful after taste going on with the other flavors, just loved it.  Since it is pretty strong and not a large drink, I then add some Sprite Zero, which left the drink still tasting pretty much the same, but with some fizz and it lasting longer!!  Thanks so much for sharing a new drink that might become a regular for me, yummy!!!  Made for ZWT 9."
383346,503878,2013/9/4,4,I doubled the drink for me and DH and served it in a martini glass.  For me it was great.  But for DH it was a little bit too sweet.   I used brandy.  Thanks Dr. Jenny :)  Made for ZWT9
135470,503878,2013/9/6,5,"Yum! We really enjoyed this drink and thought it was true cocktail - I had images of sitting in a high back booth in a dark paneled swanky restaurant a la Mad Men! I reduced the brandy slightly and still found it very potent. I thought the lemon and cherry juice really balanced out the flavor of the brandy and the bitters gave it a little earthiness. I thought the first one was a little two sweet so cut the sugar in half for the second.  Thanks for sharing Jenny, we will definitely enjoy these again. Made for ZWT ZINGO by another one of Mike and the Appliance Killers."

1239906,500217,2013/5/17,5,Delicious!  Will definitely make again.
4439,516981,2014/7/9,3,"We really liked the taste of the asian seasonings with the Zucchini, but, did not like the texture of the zucchini ribbons, it was slimy. Next time we make the recipe, we will just slice the zucchini. Instead of grated ginger, we used ginger paste and used peanut oil instead of the olive oil."
2000737529,512076,2015/12/10,2,"I can taste a hint of the flavor but this recipe makes the cookie much too fluffy, I tossed them they didn&#039;t taste great."

169430,505380,2014/5/26,5,"This is SO good. I love the rose water addition and I&#039;m thinking I might need to make a tagine dish tonight to have with this lovely tea. If your not familiar with rose water start with just 1 tsp, taste, add more to suite your liking. Used Splenda for the sugar and added brewed the tea with the pine nuts to get a bit of that flavor as well. Yum. :D"
1057310,505380,2016/1/22,5,"amazing!!  i first experienced lebanese iced tea and lebanon cafe in new orleans, great place to go if you haven&#039;t"
2000939539,505380,2016/3/25,4,"This is a great recipe, but it is missing Orange Blossom water in addition to the Rose water. It doesn&#039;t *need* the pine nuts, but it&#039;s soooo good if you have them."
2001116075,505380,2016/8/5,5,"Very similar to the absolutely delicious tea served at Lebanon's Cafe in New Orleans. A great recipe but I have to disagree that the pinenuts are optional: They do, in fact, add a wonderful nuttiness to the tea which is what sets it apart from anything else you'll ever taste. Make it with the pinenuts - it'll make you happy. :-)"
2001528385,505380,2017/5/9,0,Is regular Lipton black tea acceptable? How do you make or where can you find rose water?
37449,505719,2013/9/1,5,"I more or less halved the recipe and my son and I enjoyed it for a light supper. I had some frozen whole tomatoes, so used those instead of the tomato sauce. For the veggie broth, I used some of the tomato juice and some of the liquid from the garbanzo beans.  Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013, Zingo for team Hot Stuff."
1803170764,505719,2014/9/26,5,"This is fantastic. I made as written and flavor was great. Next time I will cook the liquid down a little more, as it was runny. I added some grilled chicken over the top, which was a nice addition."
67728,505112,2014/5/6,5,"I used this on Recipe#321948. I doubled the recipe, since I had 2 ~2lb eye round roasts. I pierced the roasts all over with a skewer before combining them in a big zip bag with the marinade, and I marinated them for 48 hours (my oven was occupied with carnitas at 24 hours). I think the extra time did it good anyway, since eye round roasts are chubby little cuts of meat. I think the extra time allowed the flavor of the marinade to permeate the meat nearly all the way through. I patted off most of the excess marinade before roasting, because I didn&#039;t want the garlic pieces to burn. What was left dripped off the roasts while cooking, mixing with the meat juices and making some somewhat salty but very tasty pan drippings that I think I might mix with some low sodium beef broth and a bit of water to make an au jus of sorts to go with my sliced beef. I really like Italian roast beef from the deli counter, and this marinade gives a similar effect here. I see some super-yummy roast beef sandwiches in my near future, thanks to this marinade! Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"

Other than leaving out prunes (just didn&#039;t fancy them!! sorry!), I made this as directed, the olives are a lovely touch, this is a very satisfying dish and so easily prepared.  Even better next day ;)   As suggested, served with couscous, excellent choice with this recipe.  Yum, loved it, thank you Elizabeth, made for PRMR tag game"
2002108797,509243,2018/4/11,4,"Great inspiration for my tagine, thanks! I made a few tweaks, which I’ve already posted but this gave me a great basis to work from, thank you!"
329769,503892,2013/7/17,5,Reviewed for ZWT9 - a lovely Greek salad that my family enjoyed. It had all the Greek flavours that I enjoy. Photo also to be posted.
305531,503892,2013/7/20,5,A really simple refreshing salad. I was out of green onions so used red onions instead. Thanks Elizabeth for sharing. Made for ZWT9.
174096,503892,2013/7/21,5,"Delicious and so easy!  Just a few ingredients to get a tasty, colorful salad.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
383346,503892,2013/9/23,5,This salad is so simple but so yummy.  I added more kalamata olives.  Thanks Elizabeth :)  Made for Alphabet tag game
2001527053,523598,2017/5/8,5,"Definitely a keeper and super fast and easy to quickly whip up. Most importantly, it tasted fabulous!! The only thing I changed was substituting the Canola for Coconut oil (unflavored, liquid). I made it for my husband's salad to take to work, but will also experiment with other dishes in the future. Thank you for sharing; it is a wonderful recipe!"
865936,503935,2013/7/20,4,"This was really good and spicy. I used fillets and over seasoned some of them with too much creole seasoning,  so be careful if you use fillets too. The sauce was very good and I made extra to put on the rice."
128473,495163,2014/4/23,4,"This was a very tasty fruit salad.  I really enjoyed the ground gloves with the yogurt and plums.  My plums were not overly sweet, so I added 1 tbsp sugar .   Thank you for sharing a recipe that was quick and easy to make, refreshing and light.  I will be making this again, in the summer when the plums are at their best. I can&#039;t wait.   Made for Spring Pac 2014"
1802565169,495944,2014/3/9,0,"I loved this recipe, it was easy and everything I was looking for. I used sweetened coconut shavings ( I couldn&#039;t find unsweetened ) and just like it said in the recipe reduced the sugar I did it by half and it worked perfectly. I also drizzled some semi-sweet chocolate over the top just because I love chocolate (the macaroons don&#039;t need the chocolate their flavor is amazing as is) and I loved it. Good job. I&#039;m keeping this one for sure ;)"
475397,512709,2014/9/8,4,I added about a tablespoon of chili powder and some garlic powder and still thought this was bland.  Could definitely be better with more spices but is a good solid recipe.
560491,493005,2013/6/12,5,"Great chicken!  Made as written and marinated it over night.  I was concerned about the amount of mustard and if DSs would eat it, but they devoured it!  I sliced mine up and served it on a salad.  will be making this again!  Made for PRMR."
1060667,493005,2017/2/3,5,"LOVED this chicken!!! The flavor was phenomenal, it has a nice tang, which I was worried about, because my daughter absolutely HATES mustard. But she didn't say a word and ate every bit of it :) Served it over a salad."
710058,503890,2013/12/31,4,"This is my go-to sweet cornbread recipe...I do add just a little more milk and vegetable oil than the recipe calls for as it was a little dry - unless I am making it for stuffing, in which case I leave it as written."
724631,503890,2014/1/2,4,"Bread tasted very good, but we preferred this chef&#039;s Recipe #503887 #503887.  I guess we like buttermilk and butter, and are willing to &quot;pay the price.&quot;  I used a cupcake pan, and this made 12 small muffins, a little more than 1/4 cup of batter per cupcake liner.  These were moist.  We live close to sea level, so maybe the difference in humidity might be a factor for us vs. howflowcanyougo.  Chef, I did not let the cornmeal soak in the milk for 10-15 minutes because you listed that in step 3, and I put everything together in Step 2.  Please stop sabotaging your own recipes by giving directions out of order.  Please decide the best way to make the recipe and give those directions in a straightforward linear fashion.  I, for one, would rate the recipes higher with clearer directions.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2000045537,503890,2015/3/6,5,This is my go-to sweet cornbread recipe..
126440,501874,2015/9/15,5,Great meatballs.  I made them and basted in a pan.  Served them with a Mediterranean zoodle salad.
128473,499653,2013/6/1,5,"Oh My Fannie, these french toasts were so good.  What a great recipe.  It was quick and easy to make, with absolutely delicious results.  The french toast was perfectly cooked and the flavor, oh the flavor; was devine. I used my favorite chinese coconut bread and cara cara oranges in this recipe.  They worked really well in this dish.  I loved the orange, pecans and cream cheese in this dish.  Thank you for sharing a new favorite for me."
2549237,499653,2013/6/12,4,"This recipe is really delicious.  The only thing I didn&#039;t like was the cream cheese so I will leave that out next time.  I made this for dinner, preparing it in the morning to &quot;marinate&quot; all day.  Super simple, delicious, sweet treat for us tonight.  Thank you Miss Fannie!  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag ~Summer 2013~."
394085,509715,2014/2/17,5,"Hard to assign stars because, for me, roasted brussel sprouts are 5+stars with just a bit of sea salt.  So gilding the lily has the potential only to add work (complexity)...so it&#039;d better also meet that perfection. :-)  This does.  Not beautiful with roasted brussel sprouts but ever so much more tasty."
266635,509715,2014/2/22,5,Delicious recipe! Just recently discovered that I love brussels sprouts. : )  This recipe really hit the spot as I love roasted vegetables and I especially love the tartness of lemon and pomegranate molasses.  Will definitely make this dish again.
2002288190,536288,2018/9/30,0,yum yum i love this so much
278907,502407,2013/6/27,5,"Thanks for posting this recipe.  I have made it before and couldn&#039;t remember where I got it and was getting nervous!   It is hands down the best Ribs recipe ever!  I made this recipe several times last summer and the requests for them are coming in.  We spend all day out on the boat and hanging on the beach so I like to make these, cut the ribs individualls right when they are hot off the grill, wrap them in foil and put them in a cooler.  So easy to eat and they aren&#039;t around for long."
2000304519,503178,2015/6/29,5,This was easy to make and so good. My 4 yr old granddaughter  ate 2 Popsicles &amp; she loved them.
2000586812,503178,2015/10/21,5,this is so good it&#039;s so creamy and fudgy loved it don&#039;t hesitate to try this recipe!!
2002168093,503178,2018/5/28,5,Love this recipe
2001062007,527347,2016/6/28,5,The Quiche was Good @ TJ for life and like the mushrooms being in the Quiche and I had a question when you cook the quiche do you add dry mushrooms or wet mushrooms out the can....
2001066495,527347,2016/6/28,5,I like the quiche and it was so good
58104,496849,2013/4/1,3,I like the slow roast method making the chicken super tender. But the skin doesn&#039;t come out crisp. I would raise the heat at the end of roasting to crisp the skin. Then definitely cut the sauce in half. Way to much.Unless you plan on braising the chicken in the sauce.
865936,504595,2013/8/11,5,I love whole grain salads. They pair so well with the sweet tomatoes from my garden and a simple vinaigrette.
1803148143,518434,2014/9/18,5,This is the best banana bread in the world.  I have been making it since before you were born. Glad it is being passed down through the generations.
2000431901,523799,2016/8/11,5,"These are fantastic! I used three eggs whisked up in place of the egg beaters, two slices of deli ham chopped, and added some dried parsley. I made two planning to have the second one later, but I ate them both immediately!"
599450,503830,2013/7/27,5,"To die for! Made as directed. So easy peasy, too. Beyond 5 stars. Thanks, Ck2plz! Made for fellow teammate Gourmet Goddess for ZWT9."
2000711844,524811,2015/11/25,5,This recipe was easy and delicious
2000711890,524811,2015/11/25,5,"Wow, As I &#039;m looking around the recipes this one caught my attention. It looks good. I was surprised it&#039;s still not in the market yet. I wonder how it tastes like but surely it&#039;ll meet me expectations"
2001620981,523456,2018/1/9,0,I have made this with Harissa and also with curry and garam masala and roasted the steaks in a 375 degree oven and they come out delicious also and I could make and serve 4. It took about 25 minutes.
8629,518396,2014/9/8,5,"This  is wonderful!  HIghly recommend it.  The sauce came out very smooth and completely delicious.  I used one of the recipes on this site for the evaporated milk.  It worked great in this recipe.  Thanks, Exercising Chef, for sharing your recipe."
539686,493282,2013/8/22,5,"We loved this...I made it as directed but since it was our main dish, I used more tofu than called for and also used several green onions in the recipe as well as on top. Also, I used brown rice just because I enjoy it and the recipe was great. Made for ZWT 9."
171790,502862,2013/8/26,5,"This was a hit with everyone at dinner tonight. I made this pretty much as directed. I did add a pinch of nutmeg and a bit of cinnamon. I also had a whole star anise baking in the casserole. I had one guest eat the pudding alone, I ate it with strawberries and blueberries as did another guest and one person had it with syrup. Made for ZWT9 Soup A Stars."
328048,502862,2013/8/26,5,"I followed the recipe and directions exactly and it came out beautifully! It was not too sweet, with good coconut flavor; nice and creamy. I think, however, that next time I would add a little bit of shredded toasted coconut on the top when serving to add a little texture and crunch and to enhance the flavor of coconut."
1628152,502862,2015/3/24,5,"I modified this for allergic kids and made it with 2  (13.5 oz) cans of coconut milk and the rest soy milk to equal the total liquids in the recipe. I also added about a tablespoon of coconut oil instead of butter.  It came out fantastic and everyone loved it! This is a great find, thanks for sharing."
674022,500830,2013/12/7,5,"Delicious! It is a keeper. Posters on Pioneer Woman&#039;s own site suggest less mustard. Start with I teaspoon and work up. If you don&#039;t like mustard go with one. If you do go with two. Use cheddar or it is good with a mixture of whatever you have cheddar, Parmesan, jack etc. Creamy roux makes the base consistency perfecto. Love it and so did my cheese loving kid. Thanks for posting. Enjoy! ChefDLH"
1797315,500830,2014/1/23,5,This was perfect!  I only had 2 cups of macaroni so I added less milk to the roux so it was thicker and clung to it really well.  I was out of dry mustard so I just added a bit of yellow mustard and it worked perfectly.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe - it will be the only way I make mac and cheese in the future!  DELICIOUS!!!
86318,506941,2014/4/24,5,"This is nice bread! It&#039;s like French bread with olives and thyme added. I followed the recipe fairly conscientiously, except for the very last. In the recipe, this bread is baked in loaf pans. However, I have had trouble getting larger loaves of bread cooked through, so I divided the dough into six smaller portions, of about 200 grams each, and baked them directly on flat baking sheets. I was a little concerned that I would get very flat bread because the dough was quite slack. It actually rose better than I had expected. The flavor is good, too. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us."
2000943999,530223,2017/4/10,1,Rainbows don't mean what God gave them to us for anymore.
2001627767,530223,2017/7/15,5,"What an awesome way to celebrate diversity. I made this cake for a Pride party and it was the centerpiece of the dessert table. Lots of ohh's and aww's. It really did turn out beautiful. It strikes me as so sad that the only other review for this cake was mad by a totally intolerant and hate-filled person who has no right to judge others, as her review insinuates."
2001678906,530223,2017/8/19,5,"Turned out great! I've never done a layer cake before and was a little intimidated, but this turned out to be easy. I followed recipe pretty closely except I used yellow instead of orange icing. My 6yo wanted a rainbow birthday cake, and she got one!! Next time I will add more pokes and jello - I was nervous it'd be a brown blob on the inside, but it wasn't! Be sure to NOT add the cold water step to your Jello, it thins out the colors. Just very slowly and carefully pour the hot Jello into the holes to minimize it running all over the top. I used a boxed white cake mix and it was super moist and crazy delicious. Best served cold, the icing starts to run once it's not cold. I had to add a tiny bit of milk to the icing mix, mine was a little to thick. Pay no mind to the intolerant review - this cake is awesome."
131126,497869,2013/5/25,5,I thought this recipe produced a really nice classic potato salad.  The dressing amounts were spot on and made the perfect amount for a good salad; not too sloppy nor too dry.  After the potato salad chilled though I did miss  the pickle relish and pimentos so stirred both in.  Both are simply family preferences. Thank you for sharing the recipe!
169430,503204,2013/8/3,4,"Even with the garlic powder and onion I still found the final mix to be a bit lacking in that famous &quot;something&quot;. I added some salt and fresh ground black pepper but that wasn&#039;t it. I added a tiny drizzle of Franks Red Hot sauce, stirred and got the Ahhhhh moment. It made a tasty sandwich on light rye bread.  Also, I found that allowing it to chill for an hour and a half really helped out."
107135,503204,2013/8/4,5,"ok i liked this alot but i didnt add as much mayo or sour cream ,just to moisten  for me,zwt9"
143721,503204,2013/8/5,4,"Have to admit, I wasn&#039;t sure how tuna and egg together would work.  Made as directed, and used artisan bread, but had no lettuce!  First couple of bites were, to be honest boring, but being from Maryland I thought, let&#039;s add some &quot;Old Bay&quot; seasoning.  This definitely gave this sandwich character.  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;"
480195,503204,2013/8/6,4,"I made this for lunch today, but I added 1 rib of celery, finely minced and 2 radishes, finely minced. Delicious!"
610488,503204,2013/8/7,4,"Made this smorgasbord style with real minced garlic and onion, along with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Not a fan of mayo so just made with sour cream. After tasting, just had to add a little dill as well. Dill makes everything sour cream so much better."
2001001945,522651,2016/5/6,0,"Omg loved it, I liked how the pineapples added a weird but nice flavor, I topped off with provolone cheese and yellow banana peppers, thanks for sharing this awesome recipe"
400708,505671,2013/8/15,5,"Made these to take to a friends bar b q and they are great.  First time I&#039;ve ever made potato buns or bread and it sure won&#039;t be the last.  They are so easy to put together and came out so light and fluffy, rose beautiful with just a very &quot;slight&quot; sweet taste that was perfect with butter and along side our dinner.  This will not be the last time I make these, highly recommend.  This one went right into my &quot;Best of 2013&quot; book"
346221,505671,2013/8/26,5,"These are the best Potato Rolls that I&#039;ve ever made, and I&#039;ve tried many recipes. The dough is beautiful, soft, light, and slightly sticky. I made half a recipe, but had to used more flour than the recipe called for to get my dough workable. I used my bread machine to make the dough. This recipe makes a lot of dough, even with half a recipe I froze half, made a 7x11 inch pan of rolls and a pie plate of cinnamon rolls. The dinner rolls were great, but the cinnamon rolls were melt in your mouth delicious. All I did for the cinnamon rolls was roll flat, brush with butter, sprinkle brown sugar over that, and spinkle cinnamon on top. I had butter left over from brushing on the dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls so I made an icing to top after baking. Wonderful!"
1803658827,520453,2015/1/14,5,Tried this recipe over the weekend for my family. My kids loved the burritos and my husband went back for seconds!
2000384314,494848,2015/8/4,5,Scrumptious and delicious ?
219942,503550,2013/7/22,4,"This was sinfully delicious, but I had a problem with the texture. I used russet potatoes, and after boiling the slices for only about 4 minutes, what I had was more like mashed. I baked them uncovered to make up for the wetness of the potatoes, and after an hour the sauce did set up in the dish. I will try this recipe again and use a less starchy potato, maybe red potatoes? With a little more firmness, this dish would easily be 5 stars, and I will make it again! ZWT9"
478451,503580,2016/6/26,4,"Lovely thai flavours. Beware, it is very rich and the &quot;broth&quot; thickens very quickly."
2324285,512063,2014/1/22,5,"Well I just love this stew - and it&#039;s definitely more of a hearty stew than a soup.  Just delicious and filling.  The black beans are the star of the dish, as the seasoning and chorizo aren&#039;t overpowering like you would imagine (Using dry beans was definitely worth the extra effort, as you could taste the difference).  The chicken came out so tender, that all we needed were spoons to cut into the pieces.  Served with plenty of tortilla chips and Queso fresco.  I will be making this again, for sure!"
285039,513051,2014/2/24,4,"I love my soda stream, and sometimes purchase the syrup for my kids because we rarely purchase commercially made soda.  This definitely tastes better than the soda stream lemon lime syrup, but doesn&#039;t quite taste like Sprite.  It was pretty good overall!"
2000567197,513051,2015/10/16,4,Great recipe. It&#039;s not too sweet and the citrus flavour comes through beautifully.
2002018072,513051,2018/2/27,0,The nutrition information is wrong on this one. I am not sure how that is controlled but it says it is 1 serving when clearly it is 5 if each serving is 1/2 cup and there are 2.5 cups yield.
425105,511199,2017/12/24,5,Really enjoyed these sweet potatoes. They were really easy too. I scaled it down to one potato and am looking forward to using the pulp of the potatoes for something else. I'll be making these again when my fresh herbs are in season next summer.
482376,511199,2018/1/29,5,"Delicious! I loved the flavor of the spices on the sweet potato skins. They crisped up pretty nicely, too. Thank you! Made for the Best of 2017 tag game."
1925885,511199,2018/2/13,5,"Ten stars! These were sooooo good! We eat sweet potatoes quite a bit, and this is a new technique and flavor - one that is going straight into my favorites file! I wondered if the herbs would overpower the sweet potatoes - but needn't have worried. They're the perfect complement! Thanks so much for posting!"
2701757,495699,2013/2/19,5,Amazing flavor for just a handful of ingredients. The bacon is great--really enhances the potatoes and corn. Easy and delicious!
1273379,506976,2013/9/18,5,It was very good. It remind me of my mother tuna recipe.
755285,513428,2014/3/15,4,"This was a different sort of soup than what I am used to, but it was quite tasty.  I had to play around with the flavors a little bit.  I did not have the poultry season but think it would have benefited from that and did not have the smoked paprika but replaced it with chipotle chili pepper.  The lemon juice definitely gives it a tangy flavor, I&#039;m not sure how I liked that.  I may not add that next time."
451319,499566,2013/9/17,5,"LOVE this hot sauce!  I&#039;ve been making it for years since I first found it on allrecipes.  Co-workers insist I keep a bottle in the office fridge and request bottles to take home.  Great topping on hot dogs, eggs, chili...everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;ve also played with using canned papaya and mango instead of peaches."
2179760,499566,2018/7/30,5,"love this! so glad I found this recipe, thank you!"
296656,517389,2014/11/18,5,Could you please tell me what to cook with this mix and how long does it last?&lt;br/&gt;Thanks
339171,526905,2017/3/25,5,"I made this exactly as directed, except that I had no fresh thyme so I substituted dried. It was simple to put together and came out great! My husband asked me to make sure to make it again."
2002301174,520952,2018/10/14,0,Added celery. Next time I will slice veggies instead of chopping. Wonder if bok choy would be good as well.
266635,498203,2014/2/26,5,"I absolutely love tomato sandwiches and I&#039;m glad to know that Tony does too : )  Wish it was summer so I could get some home grown Texas tomatoes, but used organic on-the-vine tomatoes instead.  The flavors are absolutely wonderful -- used some 12-grain bread vs. the ciabatta, but otherwise made as directed.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe when I&#039;m craving a tomato sandwich.  Made for PRMR, February, 2014."
2734387,497418,2013/3/12,5,I made this dish this evening for my family and it was delicious! I highly recommend to everyone to try making it! The potatoes really soak in the mushroom sauce flavor and it is really easy to cook which will be good for entertaining.
1271506,517817,2014/8/16,5,"I&#039;ve really been getting into the spice combinations of the Middle East and North Africa, so this recipe was right up my alley!  I think a little cayenne (maybe 1/4 tasp?) would be a nice addition.  I may have had the heat up too high, though, because it got a bit dry at the end and I had to add some water -- or should the skillet have been covered during the second hour of cooking as well?  If so, you might want to modify the recipe accordingly.  Thanks for posting!"
2002187322,517817,2018/6/15,0,"I made this, it was pretty good. But for more authentic taste use lamb meat. It's soooo good. I also added some allspice to the meat before I cooked it."
169430,502497,2013/10/24,5,"Perfect fall carrots but in fact they will be perfect in any season. Well balanced sweet and spice, so easy to enjoy. Aside from using Splenda in place of sugar they were made by the recipe and I wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Made for Photo Tag."
107135,505520,2013/8/17,5,"light ,very good tasting zwt9"
2946498,505642,2013/8/16,5,Liv - This is AMAZING!   My son wanted to know how you made it taste like pie when he couldn&#039;t find any crust in it (his favorite part normally).  Thanks for a super delicious treat!
2002174922,513048,2018/6/4,2,"Not bad I guess. Using frozen peas and carrots instead of canned ones may have helped, or maybe a different vegetable altogether. I found myself considering making a third brick of ramen to increase the ratio of noodles to egg and veggies, though if I'm being honest I may have been better off just eating ramen and seasoning as intended, even if that would have yeilded a less nutritious end product. But hey, don't get discouraged! Just because mine didn't turn out great doesn't mean that yours won't."
1800179196,501408,2013/11/2,1,"This was a fail for me!  Maybe because I used a handmixer, but I ended up with something very much resembling scrambled eggs and looking absolutely nothing like a pancake!"
2766292,501408,2013/7/16,5,"Try it , won&#039;t regret it!!!"
341486,501408,2013/7/20,1,"Sorry, this was not for me at all.  Tasted like a thin banana omelette. After I&#039;d made a few and the family all pulled faces I added flour, baking powder and milk to the remaining batter and made pancakes out of that.  They said the first ones had no &quot;bite&quot; to them."
2941555,501408,2013/8/12,5,"These are great, the kids love them! Mom and dad too!"
2958004,501408,2013/8/24,5,Very nice :)
1800042747,501408,2013/9/2,3,After reading some other reviews I thought what the heck. I added 1/2tsp of vanilla. The first few bites were interesting but soon after knew it was a banana omelette!! LOL Still worth a try just to say you did!! :)
1800044428,501408,2013/9/3,3,"I thought these were very good, for what they are.  I did add vanilla extract, just to give them a nicer flavor.  Will definitely be making these again."
2000827765,521928,2016/1/19,0,i like
2708004,514531,2014/3/21,5,"Wow, this was so delicious and so easy.  It was on the table in no time and we all loved it!"
1800258076,501408,2013/11/16,3,"Try adding only one egg and use yellow banana. Not overripe. You will have thin eggy pancakes with a too sweet banana flavor. Also, use minimal spray or oil as these can easily become too greasy. If they are too thin, a tbsp of flour will help."
1801221164,501408,2013/12/24,5,I put 1/2 tsp of Vanilla Extract
1802411092,501408,2014/1/25,5,"love! added vanilla. blended in bullet quick. very thin, cooked in butter. awesome! i don&#039;t mind the &#039;eggy&#039; flavor. needs no sweetener."
1802423641,501408,2014/1/28,5,So yummy...need to add cinnamon though!
1802430546,501408,2014/1/29,5,Turned out better than I expected. Definitely making again.
1802527471,501408,2014/2/25,4,"Added vanilla essence as per other reviews, also (on a second run) added 1 1/2 tsp of unsweetened cocoa. The result was pleasingly chocolatey, though it did need a little bit of extra sweetness added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&#039;s probably a disconnect between US and UK pancakes here - UK (though not Scottish) pancakes are usually quite thin, closer to crepes, US pancakes tend to be thicker. These will turn out thinner, like a UK pancake."
1384367,501408,2014/3/5,4,"I make these &quot;pancakes&quot; for my babies and they love them. (And these are the babies who throw scrambled eggs on the floor and drive their mother crazy by not eating protein.) They are thin and a bit eggy, though, so I&#039;ve got to go with four stars because they aren&#039;t really like pancakes. If you&#039;re looking for traditional pancakes, go elsewhere. Overall, these were a success! I recommend them for anyone with toddlers."
1802653462,501408,2014/4/8,1,This was very earthy to me; it need sugar or something.
42462903,501408,2014/6/20,5,"My daughter, who does not like eggs and never opts for protein, loved these.  They did not need extra sugar as you are going to put syrup anyway.  I would next time as per other reviewers try some cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla or banana extract.  But just as is was great for my 5 year old."
11395289,501408,2014/9/9,5,"This is a go to recipe for our house!  My toddler loves these and she typically doesn&#039;t like eggs!  We add 1/2 tsp of vanilla, sprinkle of cinnamon and a tsp of Sunflower Butter  (peanut butter).  We make in the morning and my husband and I take them in the car and eat on way to work, our daughter eats them with jam or sometimes syrup.  We made this with a potato masher... plus it was fun for our daughter to help."
1803298711,501408,2014/11/3,4,"For these pancakes I ended up blending the two ingredients making a very smooth and fluffy batter. Then continuing to add cinnamon, Salt and vanilla extract. Personally these worked very well considering I have a gluten-free diet they were fast and easy and very yummy. Don&#039;t make these pancakes thinking that they&#039;ll taste like wheat pancakes. With these pancakes I added peanut butter which pair nicely with the bananas."
11800120,501408,2014/12/2,3,Wait. I wrote an earlier review but forgot to say that I did one to one ratio.  One banana to one egg.  It was perfect.
1803680891,501408,2015/1/19,5,"This is a super quick, super easy, super healthy recipe that helps satisfy my pancake craving. Yes these are very thin a lot more similar to crepes so don&#039;t make these expecting your typical fluffy buttermilk pancakes. To enhance the flavor I also add a little vanilla extract and cinnamon to the mix. To help with the texture whip the eggs well before incorporating with the bananas and also add a little baking powder. This will make it a little fluffier. Finally I throw in a tsp of chia seeds to up the health factor and serve with a little maple syrup. Yummm."
1803739347,501408,2015/2/2,5,Excellant. Taste really good &amp; gave me my pancake fix without blowing my carbs for the whole day. They are best cooked slow &amp; watch for burning. Second side cooks very quickly.
2000085148,501408,2015/3/24,5,"Quick. Healthy. Delicious. Packed with protein and energy! As a student, this is an enrichment in my morning routine."
2000111149,501408,2015/4/3,1,Tastes like a banana omelette.
2000113837,501408,2015/4/4,5,"Loved this. Tasty with just the right amount of sweetness. I doubled the recipe and took away one egg, so I used two bananas and two eggs and it was perfect. Added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of ground up flax seeds to up the health content. Delicious!"
2000119862,501408,2015/4/5,1,"Well this was just disappointing. I don&#039;t know what I really expected but it tasted like banana and egg. Like another review said banana omelet, so just imagine adding bananas to your omelet which no one would and you have an idea of how this tastes. To be honest just cook the eggs and have the banana on the side much better and quicker! I don&#039;t eat pancakes often and this is a poor substitute. I&#039;d rather eat real fluffy thick pancakes smothered with butter and syrup once a year than make this again. People who gave this good reviews have obviously not had real pancakes in sometime."
2000134188,501408,2015/4/12,5,"delicious!!! they weren&#039;t too thick and i could finish the whole plate and i was full, not miserable, afterwards. i added a pinch of brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract by default, b/c that&#039;s what i do out of habit whenever i make pancakes. so yummy!"
2000187002,501408,2015/5/5,0,"Love this recipe! I also add vanilla paste or essence, cinnamon and berries at the end on top as well of youghut. I am on a health kick and this is the perfect, quick easy and yummy breakfast"
2000214796,501408,2015/5/20,4,"I found the one banana, two eggs was too runny. So I added another banana, and it was great! I also added a splash of cinnamon. Keep the pancakes small and they cook better too."
2000215790,501408,2015/5/21,4,"This is so delicious! I must agree that it is a little flat, but in all honesty it&#039;s healthiness outweighs it&#039;s appearance. Lactose &amp; gluten free! Will definitely be recommending it to all of my food intolerant friends :)"
2000222870,501408,2015/5/24,5,Loved these! Tasted just like normal pancakes which surprised me and my sister. I made a raspberry coulis to go with them and they were so good! Will definitely make these a lot more. Plus they&#039;re a much healthier alternative! Thanks!
2000226627,501408,2015/5/25,5,Very easy to make tasted just like a pancake. I used a food processor to blend smooth and also added some organic raw honey. Very nice recipe. Thanks.
2000260587,501408,2015/6/10,3,Doesn&#039;t taste bad! Especially if you add some vanilla extract and cinnamon but the texture.... Mine turned out looking like scrambled eggs. If you can ignore the looks and focus on the taste then it&#039;s for u!
2000261110,501408,2015/6/10,3,"I&#039;m not sure why would any one call this a &quot;pancake&quot;; I agree this is more like a sweet banana omelette or a banana crepe. It&#039;s not terrible, a bit plain in my opinion. It needs some fruit, honey, nutella,peanut butter  or nuts (or what ever you like) to enhace its flavor, otherwise it tastes as a banana omelette. I agree with other review I read earlier, who ever called them &quot;pancakes&quot; has not eaten real pancakes in a while. Still not bad, but I preffer to make mine like a crepe with something inside next time."
2000280265,501408,2015/6/19,5,"Mine turned out amazing!
I tweaked it a bit.. 
2 eggs
1 banana
Tbsp of weight control maple brown syrup oatmeal (Quaker)

Topped it with strawberries and a tsp of maple syrup"
2000287799,501408,2015/6/22,4,"Overall, I love these pancakes! They are healthy and easy, not to mention they taste great. The only things I can say about them is that they are super hard to flip, but once you get the hang of it, it&#039;s magic!
Also, I recommend using a blender instead of hand-mixing the ingredients and using honey and fruit to top it for a healthier alternative to maple syrup. And instead of using PAM, use coconut oil to rub across the pan.
I am about to make them right now again and I am going to put some cinnamon in it for extra flavor.
Have a nice day!"
2000340556,501408,2015/7/15,5,Absolutely love these pancakes. My family eats them up and asks for more.
2000383049,501408,2015/8/4,1,"It works sure, and if banana and egg is your thing then it will be great for you!
But for me it was a weird combination and the spongy omelette consistency was far from &#039;crepe like&#039;. 
Perhaps my egg to banana ratio was off?"
2000420418,501408,2015/8/22,5,Great way to get rid of overripe bananas. Classic breakfast in my home :)
368043,501408,2015/8/31,4,"I have made these a few times and really enjoy them.   Although I did alter the recipe a bit.  First, I only use one egg for one banana.  And then I add a tablespoon of flour for just a little bulk.  They taste like pancakes to me with these two changes."
2000449728,501408,2015/9/2,4,This recipe is great if you are trying to loose weight as a healthy and low calorie snack. However 2 eggs make it taste to eggy. One egg to one large/medium banana is just fine. Especially if you want to keep the sweet taste of the banana.
1801553725,501408,2015/9/12,1,"Terrible texture, terrible taste.  Worse with syrup.  Don&#039;t waste your ingredients.  This will never pass as a pancake."
2000474827,501408,2015/9/14,5,"I Love these pancakes -- I originally saw the recipe on Pinterest but that one added cinnamon to the mix and I really think that makes a difference. It gives it more flavor and the pancakes come out a little more brownish and looking like regular pancakes. Anyway, they are light, delicious and the kids and I love them. One piece of advice would be to be sure they are firmed up before trying to flip them or it will fall apart and not look so nice. So cook it mostly on the one side, the flip and cook for just 20-30 seconds on the other side."
2000526525,501408,2015/10/5,5,"I added Cinnamon and Vanilla to the mix, cooked them well on the griddle and they tasted very good. I topped with a bit of peanut butter and honey. Perfect for a light breakfast! My son loves them. He&#039;s 8 months and literally inhaled them."
2000540454,501408,2015/10/9,1,"I am sorry, but this didn&#039;t work for me at all. It looked like banana scrambled eggs. To not waste the ingredients I threw half of the banana/egg mix to some complete buttermilk pancake mix I had home and added some water to soften the mix. I ended with a fairly good pancake. It was a bit too fluffy because I added baking powder to the banana/egg mix but at least it was edible."
2000431901,501408,2015/10/30,5,"These were great! We whipped the eggs really well first, then added the banana and used the blender to make it totally smooth. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. They were similar enough to real pancakes, a wonderful grain free substitute. So sweet from the banana that they didn&#039;t need syrup, we just topped them with chopped kiwi and strawberries. My two year old actually did all the work except the cooking, and gobbled three of them down."
2000648966,501408,2015/11/7,4,Adding a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder helps make them more of the consistency of a regular pancake. I also add a little vanilla and cinnamon. You can even throw in some choc chips tho that obviously detracts a bit from the healthiness. :)
2000688081,501408,2015/11/17,4,"A ratio of one egg to one banana is definitely the way to go. Delicious banana flavor, no need for syrup. I had trouble flipping them, they tend to fall apart. Cook over lower heat and use a lid."
2001061706,501408,2016/6/24,1,"If you like scrambled eggs with bananas mixed right in, this recipe is for you. The egg to banana ratio is too high."
2001102034,501408,2016/7/25,3,"It tastes really great but I found the batter really thin, so when it came to flipping the pancakes they just fell apart - it would work better for pancake bites than full sized pancakes :)"
2001084886,501408,2016/9/13,5,I make these pancakes all of the time. They are great and low calorie. We top with fresh sliced strawberries and a dot of cool whip.
1801189345,501408,2016/10/24,5,"Made these this morning and I was pleasantly surprised. Didn't know what to expect. Used recipe, as is, with no additions. My husband loved them, too. What is easier than two eggs and a banana on a griddle? Healthy, quick, and no mess."
2001354586,501408,2017/1/16,0,"Was ok, even one egg and one banana was still too runny, added some pancake mix to it. First pancake was ok, 2nd and third from the mix were better. Next time I will try 3 bananas and 2 eggs. 1.5 banana to 1 egg seems like a better ratio."
2001362345,501408,2017/1/22,4,"We didn't have any of the problems others are listing here when made as the recipe directed. We made sure the griddle was nice and hot, and we used about 2 Tablespoons of &quot;batter&quot; per pancake -- no problems flipping. Worked great, tasted great. Added a little maple syrup to a few of them, but the blend of banana and maple flavors was weird to my palate, and it didn't need it. I tweaked the next batch to a 1:1 ratio and added cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla. I liked the consistency better on the 2nd batch."
2001364700,501408,2017/1/24,4,I adjusted the recipe: - 1 ripe banana - 1 egg - 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract - 3 tablespoons flour Topped with crunchy peanut butter and/or syrup. Very tasty and easy!
2001368868,501408,2017/1/28,4,This was amazing!!!!! I didn't whisk the eggs enough though :( My bad.... lol
2001377865,501408,2017/2/4,4,"I am a big fan of these. I stay away from refined sugar, but that doesn't mean I don't still crave it. I used a bit of vanilla, a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder and a tablespoon of powdered peanut butter with added protein. They taste like Peanut butter cup pancakes. My five year old requests them and will eat four or five in a sitting, so I call it a win with the added ingredients."
2001381315,501408,2017/2/6,3,"I did the 1 egg to 1 banana ratio. I added vanilla, milk, and some nuts to the batter. Made it into a roll and added peanut butter. Tasted great."
2001391802,501408,2017/2/14,5,I don't even like eggs and I loved this!! I did the one banana and two eggs ratio and I added fruit on top and drizzled a little honey on top.... It was amazing!!!
2001396405,501408,2017/2/18,2,"It tasted like a weird french toast with banana instead of bread. The egg to banana ratio was definitely off. Also, the texture did not resemble a pancake."
2001399441,501408,2017/2/20,0,I use a mixer and 1/8 tsp baking powder... makes a big difference in texture!
1790123,501408,2017/2/23,5,"Best pancakes ever! So sweet, addictive, and easy. I added a dash of salt, cinnamon, and vanilla."
1803589550,501408,2017/3/2,5,I made these but added a teaspoon of plain flour for texture. I also added raisins as they were cooking.
2001436774,501408,2017/3/15,5,I eat these every few days. I add cinnamon to the mix and then add honey on top when done. I love these. A few blueberries or sliced banana goes a long way too! Everyone I make these for loves them and such a good breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!
2001437598,501408,2017/3/15,5,"Tastes awesome! Used 1 egg 1 banana, pinch of baking powder and cinnamon sugar. Blended in a smoothie mixer. Touch of maple syrup on top! Didn't taste eggy at all :)"
2001443744,501408,2017/3/18,0,"I love this recipe. It's not as dry as a pancake, more like you said, a pudding, therefore I don't need to add any syrup of any sort. My husband has type 2 diabetes, so this is about as close as we can come to a bread, which we can't have on our Kenogeyics diet. It's delicious!"
2001467861,501408,2017/4/2,5,"we were looking for something sweet and decided to make these odd pancakes,they were to thin, so we put oatmeal in it,but it all turned out as mush!"
2001476275,501408,2017/4/7,2,The picture CANNOT be from these 'pancakes'. I agree with the banana omelette stories. It got two stars for creativity.
2001484054,501408,2017/4/12,5,omg i love these... i added about a teaspoon and a half of baking powder and made a little larger pancakes... also did not flip them just put them under the broiler to finish them off... i have made these about a hundred times since finding the recipe and they are fabulous... i wouldnt thank you for original pancakes now :)
2001488417,501408,2017/4/14,5,"Love these little gems. Quick, easy and tasty"
2001516589,501408,2017/5/1,3,"The first time I tried this, I ended up with something similar to scrambled banana eggs. The second time, I used a firm banana and whipped the egg whites. Perfection! The recipe as stands uses a ripe or mushy banana. When you use a firmer one and whip the whites, your pancake is similar to a pancake and holds together well"
2001523517,501408,2017/5/6,4,It is a quick and easy healthy breakfast good for kids. Toppings are optional but the sweetness from the bannana is good enough. One little thing sometimes adding flour can help
2001539151,501408,2017/5/15,0,I love these. If you add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder they puff up like real pancakes. Does anyone know what you can substitute the banana with for a savory option?
2001600960,501408,2017/6/26,5,"Not to be dramatic, but this banana pancake recipe changed my life. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon but besides that, this recipe was perfect! If you whisk the eggs thoroughly before adding the mashed banana, the finished product is super light and fluffy. You'll need a lot of cooking spray, however, because they're harder to flip than regular pancakes."
2001604614,501408,2017/6/29,5,"The recipe is great! The pancakes take much much less time than regular pancakes, and the final product feels much 'lighter' - it's more similar to thin pancakes than the English fluffy pancakes. Tastes great. Small tweaks/advice: - I used 1 egg, 1 banana + a bit of baking powder as seen in the comments. I also used a hand-held mixer to get an even consistency. I got two small pancakes out of that. They can be hard to flip as the top does not set, so making your pancakes smaller and flipping them quickly will avoid spillage. They really do need only about 30sec per side, but if you leave them on a bit too long you can't taste the difference, even if they look very dark on the surface."
2001604721,501408,2017/6/29,1,I know everyone is different but these were not what I expected
2001606241,501408,2017/6/30,0,"well, I tried it with the one egg and cinnamon but it didn't fry up nice into a pancake. I added the other egg and made it into banana scrambled eggs. Not bad, even good and low cal. Thumbs up!!"
2001606295,501408,2017/6/30,5,These were fluffy and delish! I would say the trick is to smash the banana but not to whip them with a blender or anything. I left a little texture and the were very good and fluffy.
2001607225,501408,2017/7/1,4,Great idea and overall outcome nothing like pancakes burning enjoyed it great for after training
2001542623,501408,2017/7/24,5,"I read all of the comments, and decided to use 1/2 banana and 1 egg. I added 3/4 tsp of baking powder and 2 good shakes of cinnamon. I ate 1/2 of the banana. I whipped the egg, then mashed the other 1/2 of the banana into the egg. Let it sit for a few minutes! I tried making smaller pancakes, but they ran into each other, so I made a lunch plate sized pancake. I was not interested in a banana omelet, so I flipped it, twice. I enjoyed this with some sugar free maple syrup. Now considering making more, and refrigerating it to make pancakes for tomorrow...so many bananas, so many recipes to try."
2001827830,501408,2017/11/27,5,"This is a great GF recipe, and what I loved was it did not have too much of a banana taste. If you've processed the bananas instead of mashing then you will not have the correct consistency. I've added touches of cinnamon when I want it to be a bit more of a French Toast taste; peanut butter to add a bit of fun, etc. Love this recipe &amp; so glad I found it!"
2001878400,501408,2017/12/22,5,"These are amazing! my little man loved them! he ate them and was asking for more. I also had them. yummy! i added a little cinnamon to the batter and made fresh whipped cream instead of using syrup. huge hit in my house and can't wait to make them again! i did learn that spraying the pan, even though its a Gothic non-stick pan, is very important. After that, they were easier to flip. I had to leave them in the pan on medium heat for a little more than a minute to get them cooked enough to flip, instead of 30 sec like the recipe said. again, we loved them and can't wait to make them again!!"
2001953175,501408,2018/1/25,2,Wouldn't stay together impossible to flip...this one is disappointing
2001985409,501408,2018/2/11,1,An inedible mess and a ruined pan.
2002029045,501408,2018/3/4,1,Tasted like a banana omelette....
2000040925,501408,2018/3/8,5,"As I read the title of this recipe, I must admit I was skeptical about it really resembling/tasting like “pancakes”. I read through each review, tweak, and decided to try it first with just the banana and egg, and the next time with a bit of cinnamon and baking powder added. Both were yummy, hit that crave for a pancake! I do enjoy the “tweaked” version better. (Fluffier). They are sweet enough to forego syrup, sweeteners. This is perfect for the crowd looking for gluten free, low point alternative (zero freestyle point/weight watcher) pancake. If you are accustomed to eating pancakes made with flour, it should be no shock that these would be different. Move on people."
2002151096,501408,2018/5/13,0,"I have Ulcerative Colitis and strictly follow the SCD lifestyle, which is completely grain and refined sugar free. I'm always looking for ways to meet my caloric intake for the day and these are amazing. I used an immersion blender to whisk the eggs until they were slightly frothy, added the banana and a few tablespoons of finely shredded coconut, then continued to blend until smooth. Turned out great and I didn't need any additional syrups or sweeteners!"
2002084634,501408,2018/5/16,0,Have been making it for quite some time now. Grandchildren love it - so do the rest of the family!
2001091055,501408,2018/7/16,2,"I really wanted to like these. The consistency is too wet and I only used a 1:1 ratio instead of 2 eggs like the written recipe. I ended up adding milk, baking powder, and flour (sparingly) and they couldn't be saved. :("
2002221438,501408,2018/7/17,1,That was the grossest thing I’ve ever made. It tasted like sweet eggs. ??
2002269212,501408,2018/9/8,0,My sister gave me this idea and I decided to try it today. It is quick and easy and the result is very good. I added some uncooked oatmeal to the banana and egg mixture and let it sit for a few minutes before proceeding to cook the small pancakes. I used ONE egg and ONE medium banana.
2734897,497316,2013/3/13,5,"I tried this with my kids and it is yummy.   It was a great, fun way to get the kids in the kitchen and away from the TV.    We giggle more in the kitchen."
2734932,497316,2013/3/13,5,"I thought this yummy recipe was a fun way to involve my little guy in the kitchen. I also love the taste of onion but cannot stand the texture of it. So, when the potatoes were put in the processor it totally eliminated any texture issues for me!! All around scrumptious snack and great quality time well spent in the heart of our home!"
2735870,497316,2013/3/13,5,"This is a fun little recipe to introduce your children to cooking and having fun with food. Because with a house full of picky eaters under 3 feet tall, sometimes you need all of the help you can get! Try it out and have a yummy side dish and some fun in the kitchen."

482376,505636,2013/8/15,5,Great Pad Thai! Great directions with a perfect outcome. My son LOVES Pad Thai and was very grateful when I made this for dinner tonight. The flavors are well blended and so good! Thank you for posting! Made for the Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9
107583,505636,2013/8/26,5,"Very good!  I used breast meat, but will be making this again with shrimp instead, since Shrimp Pad Thai is our favorite.  Also, I am going to add some red pepper flakes or chili-garlic sauce next time for a little heat, but as written, this recipe is quite tasty.  Made for ZWT 9."
157425,505636,2016/8/6,5,"Have seen Pad Thai made on cooking shows and it looked very good so gave this recipe a try. I used chicken breast tenderloins instead of the thighs and cashews. The directions mentioned chili to be added to the pan along with the garlic and ginger but did not see any type of chilies in the ingredients so added a pinch of red pepper flakes. Smelled great while cooking and was better when eating! Nice flavors, liked the crisp of the bean sprouts, and the squeeze of lime over everything brought it all together. Hubby even enjoyed his supper and he normally doesnt eat anything of this type. Thank you diner524 for sharing this wonderful recipe! Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest 2016 - Thailand/Indonesia."
242766,505636,2016/8/10,5,"Delicious! Pad Thai is one of my favorite dishes to order when I eat at a Thai restaurant, so I was thrilled to find an easy, delicious recipe that I could make at home. It goes together quickly and easily even though the instructions seem long. The flavors were spot on and I will definitely be making this again. The instructions call for chili but there isn't chili in the ingredients. I looked up the original recipe on About.com and saw that the ingredient list includes: 1 fresh red or green chili, sliced. So, I used a sliced serrano chili. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. **Made for 2016 Culinary Quest - Thailand for the Pi Rho Maniacs**"

2001357734,529790,2017/1/30,5,Very very good. I used this for lasagna sauce and it was WAY to good. T
1783373,513603,2014/3/28,5,This recipe is more lovely and better than what I expected.  The eggs were nestled all snug in their ricotta beds with the yummy sauce to round it out.  I used Monteray and white cheddar cheeses and I also used a whole Portuguese chourico instead of 1/4 cup and it worked perfectly.  I was bummed though that I cooked the eggs a little too long - watch the eggs as they cook quickly.  We had this for dinner and sopped up the sauce with crusty bread as suggested.  I can see how this recipe would work by making it the night before (adding the eggs the next day) and baking it in the morning or serving it for brunch.  Perfect for Christmas morning but good anytime.  Thank you KateL for a keeper!
2002106093,529119,2018/4/10,4,Nice cake! mixture was big enough to make 2. Mine came out moist with crunchy outer very nice. I used home made lemon icing as a topping

1848436,500376,2013/6/2,5,"Great dressing! I made a southwestern-type salad and served this over it, it was delicious. I used sour cream instead of greek yogurt because that&#039;s what I had on hand, and it worked really well."
2505084,500376,2013/7/18,0,This is kind of bitter. =(
2002016403,500376,2018/5/15,5,"Made this dressing this morning to have for lunch as a dip with raw veggies. I tasted for seasoning and oh my gosh it is so delicious that I can’t stop dipping veg and eating it now! Thanks so much for this recipe Cookworm, it is so delicious!!"

2324285,511017,2014/1/2,5,"So delicious!  I used a young 6lb turkey and adjusted the oven temperature and cooking time accordingly, but kept everything else the same.  I love slow-cooking birds and roasts in the oven during winter because it warms up the apartment and makes the place smell so good-  but the scent that filled the kitchen while this was roasting was especially mouth-watering.  So much garlic flavor, but it wasn&#039;t overkill at all.  The gravy was perfect, and I also used it on mashed sweet potatoes."

226867,536734,2018/8/21,5,Very tasty beans! It was pouring rain so we didn't fire up the grill and I just steamed the beans instead. I can't wait to try 'em on the barbie! (or the cajun version of grill) made for SWT2018
482376,536734,2018/8/31,4,"These were certainly very easy to prepare! I loved that! I also really like the butter and Cajun seasoning. The bean consistency was a little different, and I didn't like it as much as beans done on the stovetop. I think I may try these beans on the stovetop next time - keeping everything else the same. Made for Susie's World Tour 2018 - Cajun/Creole."
305531,536734,2018/10/4,4,These beans were simple and good. It was pouring rain........so I baked the packet in the oven which worked great. Thanks for sharing.

2692024,495275,2013/2/13,5,"MISSED THE STAR RATING ON THE FIRST SUBMISSION - please adjust - thank you.<br/><br/>Tried this the other night at a gathering of my favorite foodie girlfriends. It was outrageously good - like the ultimate combination of pizza and wings, but made with shrimp instead of chicken, so it was not only a sweet heat experience, but a ""pescavore"" friendly dish. (My father has a penchant for hot and spicy and he doesn't eat meat, so I was particularly impressed with this one). The ingredients are items I typically have on hand, or are at least a straightforward find at the market (no froo-froo gourmet shops for this) - so it's perfect for an in-a-pinch get together without being at all generic. Definitely a dish that impresses - and works for foodies or football gangs, which is not at all easy to achieve."

2324285,504017,2013/7/21,3,"Sorry, this did not work for me.  After a half hour in the oven, the loaf was swimming in liquid.  Maybe the juice from the beef?  Or perhaps uncooked eggs.  I had to drain it, and cook it for 10 minutes longer.  It didn&#039;t taste like how I thought it would- I was hoping for more of an egg loaf with some ground beef pieces, but it turned out to be just a meatloaf with strong, smelly cheese on top.  I liked the artichokes though.  I&#039;d leave out the gruyere entirely if I make this again, and use pre-cooked ground beef in the egg mixture."
2679429,494901,2013/2/9,5,These were delicious!  I love the individual portions.
2667767,494901,2013/2/9,5,mmm. Bacon.
2688935,494901,2013/2/11,5,I made this last night when we hosted a group of teens from our neighborhood.  They were a big hit with the kids AND with the adults that attended.  Will certainly make again.
2688960,494901,2013/2/11,5,"This is such a simple and delicious recipe.  I tried them over the weekend and really was impressed. From the taste you would think they would be much harder to make, but I found it to be a very quick recipe.  My favorite part was the bacon crumbled on top!"
2691324,494901,2013/2/12,5,These really tasted good.  I will definitely make them again.  I had a few leftover and just refrigerated them and ate them for lunch the next day.  I liked that they were good both hot and cold.
2201870,494901,2013/2/13,5,"Mmmm, my family would love this recipe too. This would also be a good one for the BIG Pillsbury Bake-Off!!!"
2692808,494901,2013/2/13,5,What a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing
2423668,494901,2013/2/20,5,Easy and delicious!
2703353,494901,2013/2/20,5,I made this recipe for my husband and grandchildren.  Everyone loved them and my favorite part was how quick and easy they are to prepare.  I loved the ranch plus cheese and bacon combination.  There were no leftovers! Simply delicious and a real crowd pleaser.
2708470,494901,2013/2/24,5,I am so glad that I made this dish.  My whole family loved it and it was so easy to make.  I will make this again.
2711763,494901,2013/2/25,5,These were really good.  My spouse made the recipe the other night and I thought they were delicious.  It is a great combination of of flavors and it was nice that they were portable.  We will probably take them to picnics this summer.
2711815,494901,2013/2/25,5,I made this for lunch today and they were very tasty.  I also appreciated that the recipe was very easy and quick.
145352,503589,2013/8/20,5,Such flavorful couscous!!! Loved it all!!! Made for ZWT 9!
1680722,503589,2014/2/27,5,"Really delicious!&lt;br/&gt;I prepared this recipe with one cup of very tasty fresh pressed orange juice and i substituted the couscous with bullgur as I did not have couscous at home.&lt;br/&gt;This came out delicious, filling but still light! A perfect side dish to any meat recipes.&lt;br/&gt;I imagine that this would be even very good served cold in sommer to BBC meat.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this recipe!"
2000746847,531178,2017/10/10,4,Easiest recipe ever!

2000738936,531178,2018/5/19,5,"Just as easy as it looked in the video, and every bit as tasty. I've made them twice now, and been asked for the recipe 3 times! I'd prefer to make my own puff pastry, but thought I'd start with the recipe as written first few times. ;)"
305531,502784,2013/7/24,5,"Yum! I&#039;ve never added cream cheese to deviled eggs before, but this made them extra creamy. Thanks Lynn for sharing. Made for ZWT9."
133174,502784,2013/11/16,5,I love deviled eggs and loved the creamy texture of these coupled with a hint of spice from the tobacco and Cajun seasoning.  Made for Aussie Swap.
128473,502784,2014/7/22,5,"Wow, what a tasty treat.  I really enjoyed the eggs prepared this way.  The cream cheese is a nice addition.  Love the spice, I&#039;ll be making these again, thanks for sharing."
226863,502784,2014/12/28,5,"Love deviled eggs, and these are a great variation to try!  The cream cheese made them extra creamy, and the sweetness of the sweet relish offset the heat from the hot sauce.  Enjoyed these wonderful appetizers today!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for For Your Consideration game on yuku.com."
266635,502784,2018/8/16,5,These deviled eggs were wonderful and they went perfectly with our southern Cajun dinner tonight. Loved the addition of the cream cheese and they were really nice and flavorful.
226867,502784,2018/8/23,4,"Great deviled eggs! I loved the crunchy relish - perfectly offset the creamy cream cheese and yolk mixture. DH did not like them and I couldn't get him to describe what he didn't like, so who knows. Anyway, I'd use a bit less cream cheese next time. made for SWT2018"
67728,502784,2018/8/25,5,"Booze, pancakes and deviled eggs are the 3 things that I almost never partake in outside of Tour time, so of course I had to try these. I really liked the filling in these, especially after they chilled and the flavors had a chance to meld. The only change I made was to use dill pickle relish in place of sweet pickle relish. I'll eat just about any kind of pickle EXCEPT sweet pickles, so I only buy dill relish when I need pickle relish. Definitely a keeper IMO! Thanks for posting! Made for SWT2018 Cajun/Creole for Team Fellowship of the Stove"
144373,505513,2013/8/25,5,This recipe was very flavorful.  Family enjoyed the flavor of the sauce with the pork and greenbeans. Made as written using the ground shrimp.  Thank you for posting.  Made for ZWT9
2000535225,515641,2015/10/7,5,"I am a biased reviewer... this recipe is from my sister, who made these for my family.  We all loved them, including the two kids under 10.  She makes them ahead and then freezes them individually.  They reheat beautifully.  Give them a try!"
1802739487,511454,2014/5/13,5,"Great quick meal!  Loved the flavor and how you didn&#039;t have to soak the beans.  I did add a bit more salt to our plates, but that might be us loving salt.  I will keep this recipe for sure.  Thanks!"
2001373816,511454,2017/1/31,5,"FYI- Most Worcestershire sauce is not vegetarian! I found this recipe searcing for vegetarian pressure cooker recipes, so just thought I should let you know :) Great recipe, we're cooking it right now (using Annie's vegetarian Worcestershire sauce!) and we're excited to see how it turns out!"
2001561024,529563,2017/5/30,5,I made this dish today my family LOVE IT it was easy. the only thing I did different was I used fresh garlic instead of minced garlic to my taste. Delicious .
93446,514058,2017/10/24,4,"Not the prettiest cake but it makes up for its looks in taste. My husband ate two pieces. It is more like a bar cookie in texture than a cake. Overall, a nice, homey treat."
690623,514058,2017/11/9,5,"I made this when my family was coming for dinner. Even th two men who are not a huge fan of Apple Cakes loved it!! I served it with softly whipped cream and we all had seconds. Delicious. Made in memory of Sharon. Awesome cook, great lady."
253884,516548,2014/6/13,5,"I baked mine in a bundt pan and came out beautifully. Moist soft and have fine texture to it. The cake is not too sweet like most cake do. Too much crumb toppings, so I cut mine in 1/4. Everyone should try this cake because truly it is an awesome cake. My husband who is on a diet also love this cake with a cup of coffee. Thank you cristi for posting this recipe."
724631,509998,2014/3/23,3,"As someone used to a low-sodium diet, I was overwhelmed by the salt. Although the 1 tablespoon of pepper fit in, the accompanying tablespoon of salt should be eliminated due to the 1 1/2 pounds of cheese.  The b&eacute;chamel sauce was supposed to take about 10 minutes, but it took me 45 minutes after I raised the heat to medium, then medium-high.  The mac &#039;n cheese needs to rest at least 5 minutes before serving to hold its shape.  This is the first time I used panko on mac &#039;n cheese, and it seemed too blond for an already very light macaroni and cheese, and made me question why I would want to eat so many crumbs. Lastly, unless the entire tray will be consumed at one meal, I think dried parsley would be a better garnish at the very end.

Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
804550,493492,2013/2/28,4,This is an interesting recipe and surprisingly tasty. I used naan flatbread that had garlic flavoring. I think this would work well in a pita pocket too. Made for February Sun & Spice tag.
2001957247,510731,2018/1/27,0,"Quick question about this recipe, it says to add the sugar to the egg whites while mixing, then says sift the sugar with the almond meal and salt. I'm confused as to what to do with the sugar and which one. Trying this recipe today, fingers crossed!"
220348,501168,2013/6/21,5,"Rum and arborio rice, together! It worked out really well, and the rum was not overpowering. With the peaches and raisins, it did feel like a summer dish, I made it a couple of times, and enjoyed it with bbq."
80353,501168,2013/6/22,3,We did not care for this very much.  Flavours came out to simple.  Perhaps a hint of sweet chili sauce to balance out the sweet of the peaches?  Definitely an infinitely tweak-able recipe.
2734669,501168,2013/6/22,5,I tried this recipe for my wife and I.  I didn&#039;t put coconut in because we don&#039;t like it. Everything else was light and refreshing. The peaches and raisins made this nice. I will make this again the same way. I&#039;m glad we tried this.
128473,501174,2013/6/22,4,"My dh &amp; I have never tried bread pudding before and weren&#039;t sure what to expect.  We loved it.  I used chinese coconut bread and bought candied ginger.  I also added a little candied orange peel as suggested.  It was so good, rich and creamy with a great ginger flavor. The gingered rum raisins were awesome, they tasted fantastic.  I did garnish with a drizzle of warm honey and ginger rum raisins.  Really creative use of the contest ingredients.  Good luck in the Contest."
131126,501174,2013/6/22,5,Delicious and each of the layered flavors were stellar. I thought the recipe was a creative use of contest ingredients! I enjoyed making my own candied ginger and thought that inclusion transformed the recipe into gourmet.  I used french bread and did use the fresh nutmeg.  The bread pudding was creamy. I&#039;ll definitely be making this again! Good luck in the contest!
594620,502578,2016/1/25,4,"Very nice, fun salad.  I did, however, make a few changes.  :)  Firstly, I soaked the raw cashews overnight (8 hours) to make the dressing much creamier AND to make the protein much more digestible.  Secondly, I quartered a large head of Romaine instead of Iceberg as Romaine has much better nutrition.  It looks quite different but we&#039;re used to that in my family. :)  Lastly, I added organic orange peppers and dino kale ribbons for both their nutritional benefits AND visual interest.  Nice salad.  Thanks so much for the idea!  :)"

1702915,529564,2017/2/24,1,I'd be afraid to even attempt this recipe as the direction are so poorly written. Where in the ingredients is red pepper. What to do with the packaged cheese that comes with the box?
296809,504846,2013/8/3,5,"Made for ZWT-9 &amp; the Goddesses, I was happy to find this breakfast recipe as an option because it is so typical of the Icelandic breakfast. DH would opt for the &quot;exactly as written&quot; version, but I admit to using dry dill &amp; putting a bit of my own spin on it by adding some grated Gouda cheese. It was a familiar &amp; yummy easy-fix start for my ZWT cooking day. Thx for sharing the recipe w/us."
1226388,504846,2013/8/4,5,"Yummy!!  This made a wonderful lunch for me along with  recipe#504835.  I used cocktail sized pumperickel breads and I couldn&#039;t resist spreading a thin coating of djonn mustard on the bread before putting thin slices of deli ham, the eggs and a sprinkle of dill.  Made for ZWT9"
174096,504846,2013/8/6,5,"Lovely, and so simple to make!  The dill really made it stand out from a usual eggs-and-ham type breakfast.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
542159,504846,2013/8/8,5,Quick easy goodness any time of day or night scaled back to serve one. I was very liberal with the fresh dill and eggs and dill go together so well then bring in some ham and yummers. Thanks for the post.

494084,495501,2014/4/25,4,"This was pretty good.  Certainly easy and inexpensive and pretty healthy too.  Gets 4 stars from us because as written it really needed some more seasoning.  I added a bunch more paprika, some salt, some seasoned salt and pepper it was pretty good this way.  Would be interested to hear others spice additions.  Thanks for the great recipe the 80srule......."
128473,522861,2015/8/26,5,"This was wonderful momaphet.  We enjoyed this tasty dish very much.  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Served with apple sauce on the side.  OMG, The flavor from the garlic, cheese, fried onions and apple sauce  is out of this world good.  We enjoyed it very much and will be having this again often. Who knew that apple sauce with noodles would be so comforting.  Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.  Made for CQ2 - Family Picks."
2000747226,498234,2015/12/14,5,"Great recipe. I have made it a handful of times now and it tastes great with gorgonzala, blue cheese or both. Since the cheese usually comes in a 4oz package, I usually throw all 4 oz into the quiche. Also, the last time I made it, I forgot fresh onions so I used 2-1/2 cups frozen diced onions and it still came out delicious! I highly recommend trying this recipe out."
2000056159,511324,2015/3/11,5,I finally found the best french bread!!!!! I made this bread and it has one of the best taste to french bread. I used the recipe as provided and timed the process and it works..... The flavor is wonderful.  I have baked for years and this recipe has replaced my other french bread recipes.
48065,511324,2016/12/31,5,"wow, just wanted to whip up something for the Onion Soup..this quick bread is awesome!! I left it a bit sticky with 5 1/2 cups flour and used the 1/2 to roll it out. Moist bread and it raised like a Monster bread in a Lucy episode!! Next time, I think possibly 3 or even 4 smaller loaves can be made from the dough because it just keeps on rising while the oven heats up. Definitely going to whip this up again!!"
1330903,511324,2018/7/14,4,"Turned out pretty decent. The inside did not have the texture that french bread typically has, though (where you can break the soft of the bread up into 'shards'). Ended up more cake-ish in texture, but still delicious. This is likely because the only flour I had to use was baking flour (lower protein/gluten level) mixed with AP flour. I skipped the entire step of the microwave portion, instead just letting the dough rise with a warm damp towel over it. Nonetheless, this disappeared so quick once out of the oven. I tried putting an egg wash on one of the loaves, but it made little difference in the end (was trying to get a sheen to it)."

296809,503575,2015/2/4,5,"Made for the FYC Tag Game - I made this as written except that I did not serve it w/potatoes as suggested. I served it the way we eat it here .. atop buttered toast.  It was so good that I was actually purring as I ate my brunch today. I did have a moment of confusion about the mustard ingredient. I couldn&#039;t tell if you wanted a table mustard, sweet mustard, Dijon mustard or other grainy brown mustard, etc. I finally opted to use 1/2 T sweet mustard &amp; 1/2 T Dijon mustard. Loved this BK. Thx for sharing it w/us."
50509,503575,2016/4/4,5,"My favorite way of making herring is the way Mother did (recipe posted on food.com), but this one caught my eye, as I love dill. And this is definitely an excellent recipe. I never liked the commercial sour cream herrings, this is nothing like those. I used salt herring, which I can conveniently buy at several places in my area. I soaked it about 24 hours to remove some of the salt. No chives at the market, and I did not want to use the garlic chives in my garden for this, so I used the green tops of scallions, finely chopped, which worked well. For some reason I have no mustard at home, so I used some horseradish cream, and that blended in well. I simply forgot about the lemon juice, and used only about 1 tsp of sugar. The sauce was very tasty. I also just mixed everything together instead of layering, so used a ceramic dish. I did sprinkle with additional chopped dill. While herring with boiled potatoes is very customary for us, too, I ate this with good Lithuanian rye bread, and it is delicious."

[Made and reviewed for New Kids on the Block]"
107583,502339,2013/7/9,5,"Great recipe.  I will be using the poaching liquid portion of the recipe just for having salmon, but the green beans were good.  I served that part room temperature and the salmon hot.  I used shallots instead of pearl onions.  Fresh tarragon from the garden and really looking forward to making this when I have fresh beans in the garden.  The store bought ones today had just about seen better days!  :)"
2268495,519700,2015/12/2,5,"MawMaw sure knew what she was doing! This was delicious as is. I made no changes except to use Bisquick for the dough instead of canned biscuits.

If you need to feed a crowd on a cold day or after  skiing,sledding,hunting,etc. without breaking the bank, this is the dish for you. Thanks for posting!"
80353,502951,2013/7/16,5,"Basically, the salad I make nearly every other day - so I knew we would love it.  I used vari-coloured peppers instead of just green, because I love the sweetness of the red and yellow peppers in this salad, and how pretty it makes the salad look.  I am so glad to see that no vinegar, etc., is called for in this recipe.  That is EXACTLY how we make it here in Greece.  Ideally, if you have vine-ripened summer tomatoes, the tart juices that drizzle out into the oil will create its own dressing!  Lots of crusty bread to sop up these juices is a must here in Greece!"

I served this over a bed of lettuce, but that wasn&#039;t necessary. From now on, will serve just as directed.  I loved the technique of salting the veggies, they were very flavorful.  Everyone picked at the remaining salad until everything was gone!  Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe, teammate!  Made for ZWT9, for team Gourmet Goddesses."
480195,502951,2013/9/4,5,This is such a tasty salad - I could eat it every day! This was a perfect dinner for an extremely hot evening. It looks beautiful and has great flavor. I will make this often. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
103809,516173,2015/3/28,5,"Absolutely wonderful!  Because  it&#039;s prepared in the crockpot, it is easy prep.  The flavor is amazing.  It makes a lot and I like to package it in ziploc baggies and put them in the freezer to pull out for quick dinners at a later date.  Everyone I&#039;ve served this to asks for the recipe."

131126,510361,2015/1/10,5,"This proved to be a nice meatloaf and one enjoyed.  I used one pound of ground turkey (instead of two pounds) and the rest of the ingredients as stated.  I made this early in the day and let it chill all day in the fridge to bake for dinner.  Although very soft when first made, it firmed up nicely and was sliceable.  The meatloaf has a  sweet flavor and was lovely even in sandwiches the next day.  I thought this would be wonderful as cocktail meatballs with a glaze.  Definitely a do again recipe for my diners!

These are some of the best pancakes I&#039;ve ever had!  The only changes I made to the recipe were to skip the nuts (can&#039;t have them!) and I used fresh pineapple because we always have some on hand.  The best size for this is no more than 4 inches in diameter. The cr&egrave;me Anglaise was the divine accompaniment, but I could eat these just plain with the diced fruit or maybe dusted with some powdered sugar! Thanks so much for posting this marvelous recipe - if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Made for My Three Chefs 2013."
114027,503746,2013/7/27,5,"Loved these! They were a little time consuming to make in batches, but there is no other way to do it. I also would recommend sprinkling a little more salt on them after they come out of the pan. These has a great crispy outside with a nice soft inside. Made for The Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT 9"
226867,503746,2013/8/28,5,What a tasty snack! Or as a side for something grilled. I cut the cayenne just a bit and the spiciness was perfect. Made for Soup-a-Stars ZWT9 zingo
171790,503746,2013/8/29,5,Very nicely flavored.  We love  chickpeas and this is a nice way to spice them up a bit. Made for ZWT9 Family Picks
498271,503746,2013/9/1,5,"Wow - this is a terrific way to serve chickpeas!  I made half the recipe and wish I&#039;d made more.  Loved the crispy and flavorful outside while they were still tender inside.  Thanks for sharing a keeper!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
1706426,501887,2013/7/23,5,"Wonderful,refreshing treat! I will make this again and again! Thanks for sharing, made for PRMR  2013"
128473,502411,2013/7/15,5,"Wow, 5 stars all day long girlfriend.  This lovely treat is perfect, flavorful and very refreshing.  I really loved the combination of flavors in this quick and easy to make soda. My coconut milk did seperate but I didn&#039;t care, still tastes great.  It&#039;s just the thing for these hot summer days we are experiencing.  Thanks for sharing a new family favorite, even the dh enjoyed this one."
350938,503122,2014/10/23,5,A great tasting lamb dish we really enjoyed. I used millet instead of cous cous and this worked perfectly :)
724631,513440,2014/4/25,5,"Delicious, slightly sweet chicken, so easy yet looks so special!  Served with the recommended Recipe#513421; these recipes were perfect together.  Because the side dish used coconut oil and coconut oil performs better on high heat, I used that instead of olive oil.  I couldn&#039;t find chile pepper jam, but I found Howard&#039;s Hot Pepper Relish, to which I added 2 teaspoons sugar to make it &quot;jam-like&quot;.  There was just a hint of heat in my sauce.  Can&#039;t wait to make this again!  Made for Spring 2014 Pick A Chef."
226867,513440,2015/1/2,5,"Excellent! I used breasts instead of thighs and they were just fine. Thanks for sharing, LIG!"
266635,513440,2015/1/11,5,We enjoyed this wonderful dish very much.  I did have to make a few changes out of necessity though.  I only had two very large chicken breasts so I baked them and then added the jalapeno pepper jelly (couldn&#039;t find chile jam) during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  My hubby really liked the sweetness of the pepper jelly with the bite of the jalapeno bits.  Made for the For Your Consideration tag game.
128473,513440,2017/1/20,5,"Wow, was this chicken ever good. I loved what the lemon juice did for the Chile jam, so fresh and lively, not too hot or sweet, just perfect. I also baked in the oven and glazed with the jam. Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy often. made FYC tag game."
239758,513440,2018/10/21,5,"Oh my goodness, what a delicious recipe for chicken. A little while ago, a friend gave me a jar of gourmet chile jam that, in my opinion, wasn't all that interesting. I chose this recipe to see if it might be the perfect way to use up this jam. Well. I was right. I used a couple of boneless chicken breasts, and they were perfect. You can be sure this jar of chile jam will be gone in no time. Served with sweet potatoes and wild rice."
255338,493704,2013/1/17,5,"Thank you so much for posting this. I had been looking for mine to no avail. It really does make for a fluffy bread, so soft too. So happy to find this."
400708,493704,2013/1/29,5,"Just finished making this and very pleased with the results.  It is a soft, light bread with a slightly sweet background that slices evenly.  I was really happy to see you included the info on amounts at the bottom as I don't have a scale.  Can't comment on the staying power yet as just made it.  I'm thinking this is going to make a nice sandwich bread and it's scheduled for DH's lunch tomorrow.  There were a lot of steps but it's not really complicated, just very complete directions.  A different technique that was fun to try and I was pleased with the results.  As usual with your recipes Donna - this one worked just as described."
168771,493704,2013/1/30,5,I love this simple technique for soft breads.  The taste and light crumb is what I want in a sandwich bread or a roll.
2696108,493704,2013/2/17,5,"My first time making bread using the 'tangzhong' method and it came out soft and fluffy. Thank you Donna for sharing this awesome recipe. I just want to highlight a couple of things...I don't have a bread machine and instant yeast so I had to 'proof' the yeast with warm milk and sugar. Also, for me, the baking time was shorter...20-25 min. Overall, the result was well worth the time and effort. This recipe is a must-keep!"
1525065,493704,2017/6/2,5,I make the tangzhong in the microwave 25 seconds at a time in my microwave it takes 2 times I stir it up with a fork then toss everything in my bread machine on dough setting great rolls for tuna sandwiches I also use that technique when I make sticky buns yumm
226867,506896,2013/10/12,5,"What could be easier? I sprinkled a tsp. of shredded coconut on top,too."
2103405,529923,2017/2/11,0,I thought this was an oatmeal recipe. There's no oatmeal in the ingredient list.
542159,506651,2013/11/2,5,There is no better way to start a fall day than with the wonderful flavors of fall. I did not have any pecans so used a little toasted walnuts instead. All I can say is Yum and thanks to the tasty post.
400708,499084,2013/5/18,5,"While reading about you on &quot;Chef of the Day&quot; (congrads on that) found this recipe and LOVE it, DH loves hot mustard with so many thingsI I usually just mix it with water and go for it - but this is so much better and how I&#039;m sure it&#039;s supposed to be done.  We served this with grilled polish sausages and a side of sauerkraut and it was the star of the entire meal.  I&#039;ve taken a photo that I&#039;ll post later when I get it uploaded but had to write and let you know how much we enjoyed this.  Now hoping you&#039;ll post some of your wife&#039;s recipes like her - Honey wheat bread.  Many thanks for posting this one."
58104,501165,2013/6/23,4,This was pretty good! Nice and creamy.  The lime did get lost in it so a good zesting of it before serving helps.&lt;br/&gt;I used hot water to soak the rice cutting the time of soaking. My soaking time was while I gathered and prepared the ingredients. I used the whole lime. Raisins were soaked in coconut rum. I did add the rum to the mix. The coconut was barely there. Some toasted coconut would be a nice garnish. I did cook over very low heat till tender. Thanks and good Luck in the contest.
488441,501165,2013/6/24,4,"This was creamy and good, well-balanced but missed the taste of the coconut. I do like the zest of the lime as lime refreshes everything."
2000191980,520867,2015/6/13,5,"Delish!! Recently went to a market and had &quot;street&quot; tacos for the first time. Decided to whip these up for my family and they were fantastic! Everyone ate them, even my picky little one! Will definitely be hanging onto this recipe! Thanks for sharing :)"
267527,510162,2013/12/3,4,"Quick and good. I used peach preserves, as I had those on hand. Thanks, Jan."
2001047423,535650,2018/5/9,5,"I hadn't done anything like this combination before, don't know what Fresno chillis are, there's red, green, long, small, thin, fat, medium or combination of those as well as Thai Bird's Eye in UK supermarkets so I used some of them, red to keep with the colour scheme; Mexican oregano, nope, just Italian,other than that, I loved it &amp; will make again for salads too, very tasty!!!"
2001523099,535650,2018/5/20,5,"I used organic pre-cut carrot matchsticks, red onion, Serrano &amp; jalape&ntilde;os because my grocery was out of Fresno, and even added some purple cabbage. It’s delicious! I use it on salads, tacos, wraps, sandwiches, and even as pizza topper! Crunchy, tangy, sweet, and spicy. Very well balanced."
2000725198,525006,2015/12/2,5,I can&#039;t wait to try this!!! Sounds delicious!
2000725197,525006,2015/12/2,4,"It&#039;s got great flavor, and disappeared almost immediately after I made it. I think I might try it without the cilantro but with a little hot sauce next time. And Yes, there will definitely be a next time."
2000725340,525006,2015/12/2,5,Love the mix of beans. I&#039;ve always just used garbanzo.
2000725908,525006,2015/12/3,5,It was super simple to make and tasted wonderful! It was a big hit at the party!
2324285,513219,2014/3/1,4,"We enjoyed this stew.  The turkey, beans and spinach make this a balanced, nutritious meal, but it still tastes good.  It does taste similar to a chili, but not as spicy.  It was good eating on a cold winter night."
2002232117,532402,2018/7/28,5,"These were delicious! My husband declared it was the best meatball he's ever eaten. I added panko breaded finger sized eggplants to the pan while cooking the meatballs because I had them, and I used fresh oregano from my herb garden. I find dried oregano can be bitter. Bonus: We have a local farmer we buy lamb from."
1801397004,511045,2013/12/27,5,These are soooooooo yummy! I am hooked on them. Many thanks Merry Cook.
494084,497987,2014/8/26,5,"This was surprisingly good.  For some reason I expected it to not be very good but it was cheesy, mild but flavorful.  And, it felt fairly healthy.  Would definitely make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe Teena...."
37449,515283,2014/5/24,5,Loved this with baby romaine and red lettuce! I have a similar recipe(Recipe #204023)and this was just as good. Thanks for posting!
1602102,494416,2013/3/23,5,this was absolutely delicious! It was messy to make but well worth it. I watched the process on Rachael Ray and hers was not as messy a process when transferring to the pan. I used Franks brand hot sauce  and made my own dough. I served it at my Super Bowl Party and it was gone by the end of the night. I also made ranch dressing for dipping. I&#039;m making another one this week.

2123645,536643,2018/9/25,5,Very good! I've never had Thai Green Curry before and was very impressed with this recipe. I used Thai Kitchen brand of green curry paste and it wasn't too spicy. Make sure to serve with lots of basmati rice to soak up all of the delicious sauce!
679953,506656,2013/9/30,5,"Enjoyed the wings, but loved the sauce.  It was very good, and flavorful, and made for a great football snack/ lunch.  Made for PRMR tag."
2399085,506656,2013/11/10,5,"Wow, what can I say? These really are great. What a flavor burst in your mouth, we love these so much. Thanks for the recipe."
482376,527454,2016/7/16,5,"Awesome!!! This was the first time making lumpia for us. My daughter's boyfriend was over, and his family came from the Philippines. He was so excited to help and it made for such a fun night. The filling flavor is outstanding! This recipe is going into my Best of 2016 file. This was such a yummy appetizer! I served it with some sweet and sour sauce, but the lumpia really didn't need to be dipped. They were so good on their own! Thank you!"
204024,527454,2016/7/18,0,"The flavor of this was delicious. We had a terrible time getting our lumpia done in the middle. It would cook so fast on the outside it was almost black but the inside wasn't done. We tried to cook it a lot of ways, but never really succeeded very well."
2842349,500602,2013/5/27,0,These patties belong to Po&#039; Man Meals.  The link to the ORIGINAL recipe is found here - http://www.pomanmeals.com/cheesy-broccoli-patties/.
65197,500602,2013/6/17,5,These patties are fabulous!!  I cut out the step of saut&eacute;ed onions and garlic (finely chopped they cooked during the baking time)  ....I tossed them in raw and added a 1/2 of minced jalapeno for just a little spice!  Very easy and delicious!
2464844,500602,2013/8/2,4,"My family liked them.  Even though I&#039;m a garlic lover, I&#039;d suggest cutting the garlic to one clove.  Also, the phone rang while I was sauteeing the onions &amp; garlic and they browned a bit.  I&#039;d suggest cooking them low and slow to get the sweetness from the onions, but not the browned onion flavor.  I&#039;ll cook them again."
2931189,500602,2013/8/4,4,these so tasty and easy to make -
43454289,500602,2013/9/6,2,Probably won&#039;t make again.  Very dry and somewhat tasteless.  Falls apart easily.  There are a dozen tastier ways to eat broccoli.  On to the next.
2000072288,500602,2015/3/19,4,"My toddler gobbled these up!  I&#039;m so happy that after so many failed attempts at trying to make him eat broccoli, he&#039;s finally loving it with this recipe! I filled my mini muffin pan and they browned nicely in 20mins. No flipping needed. Made 24. I can see myself making them more often!"
163112,504005,2013/10/16,5,A new favorite at our house!!  I used dill seed instead of caraway seed.  I made it in a cast iron skillet.  It came out perfectly!  Made for Travel Through Tunisia in the NA/ME Forum 10/13.
2001016357,517781,2016/5/18,1,No disrespect to who ever wrote this recipe but this is not a copycat of Cracker Barrels tartar sauce. There are carrots in their tartar sauce.
2001619058,517781,2017/7/9,1,I don't know who wrote this but you are way off! There is no herb dill and there a carrots in theirs. I'm allergic to dill and I've been eating this for years and it's never killed me so far! So reading this recipe was a huge waste of time!
539686,496440,2013/4/1,5,Very tasty and easy sauce...we had this with scallops and it was delicious. Thanks for posting!
226863,496440,2014/4/1,5,"This is delicious!  I made this for scallops, and would love to have served over angel hair pasta, but right now I can&#039;t have any pasta for dietary reasons.  Fabulous scallops, and I know I&#039;ll make these again.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Holiday Tag game."
251917,513455,2014/5/27,5,Aussie Recipe Swap #88: Delicious! Such a unique twist on the traditional stuffed peppers and made healthier with the use of ground turkey too! I am looking forward to making this dish again!
128473,517433,2014/8/12,4,"This was a nice soup.  I made it in a crock pot for the Russian Soup&#039;s On Challenge and let it simmer for most of the day.  The broth was delicate in flavor and the dumplings were light and fluffy, with a great flavor, the vegetables were tender yet crunchy.   We like a more rustic, heartier soup, so I left the vegetables and chicken in the soup.  It tasted really good. I did add more salt and pepper.   Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  Made for Culinary Quest - Russian for the Suitcase Gourmets."
527607,517433,2014/8/12,4,"I really enjoyed this recipe, the dumplings were a lot easier to make than i expected. I used a slow cooker for the Soups On challenge for Culinary Quest 2014"
39708,493867,2013/3/29,5,Just the right amount of sweet and zing......perfect!
266635,493867,2014/4/30,5,"Whipped this dressing up in short order.  Love the combination of the chili sauces in this dish.  Can&#039;t wait to use it on a Reuben sandwich.  Made for Spring PAC, 2014."
2584658,493867,2016/2/6,5,"This dressing is dynamite!  My family likes thousand island style dressing, and this is thousand island on steroids.  I feel like taking it to the restaurant that makes the best Reuben sandwich and insisting they use it.  I have made it twice and stayed true to the recipe, but personally found that the juice of one half lemon was plenty.  Also inspired me to use the sweet chili sauce in other sauces."
37449,501935,2014/4/23,5,"Oh my goodness, these were so good!  I&#039;m lucky I got them all to myself because I would have fought over them too! I did drizzle more balsamic vinegar over them after they were cooked. Thanks! Made for PAC event 2014."
2001353656,501935,2018/4/6,5,"These where fantastic, will make again and again. I did drizzle more balsamic vinegar after cooking and added good Parmesan cheese."
2002190709,501935,2018/7/2,0,AwwMan! Awesome very satisfied! I will serve this the next time I have company!!
2001456340,530640,2017/3/27,0,Cool. Looks tasty
1803450563,530640,2017/8/21,4,"It should be 2 1/4-ounce packages of gelation, and not 2 1-ounce pkg. Other than that, we iced and did the glaze as written (we were using a dome-shaped cake pan so we didn't do layers with a core), and it turned out great!"
2852219,499910,2013/6/5,5,"This was quick easy and delicious, will please the pickiest eater, just let everyone add their own toppings. Shell crisps up and is as good as something you get in a restaurant."
1800247110,499910,2013/11/14,5,"Delicious and easy! Tastes even better if you cook the chicken in the crockpot the day before then let chicken rest overnight in the fridge before making them- let&#039;s the spices really come through. We garnished with fresh cilantro, corn salsa, green onions, and tobasco sauce."
1802972363,499910,2015/1/21,5,"So good and easy! I used two large cans of chicken, so that made it even easier! I used smaller tortillas, so it makes 12! Ive made it about half a dozen times now and we all love it -- we topped with sour cream, guacamole, salsa and shredded lettuce. Thank you for the recipe!"
2000168997,499910,2015/4/27,5,"Makes your friends think you are the best chef in the world - and it&#039;s so easy! I had a similar recipe with re-fried beans, green chilies and red enchilada sauce on top, served with rice and beans. It&#039;s easy to shred the chicken if you boil it - but I see some people used chicken from a can which is something I&#039;ll look forward to trying. Also the cream cheese seems like it would be weird but it absolutely makes it (Coming from someone who is not a sour cream fan and was very skeptical). Overall WONDERFUL recipe and is one of my absolute favorite meals!"
2000221206,499910,2015/5/23,5,Like all great recipes simple with few ingredients but really tasty!

1706426,493502,2013/4/23,4,"This was quite good, but I made my own bread and it got extremely crispy. Perhaps that is why the suggest using their own!  I think the filling would really benefit from some cheddar for extra flavor. Thanks for sharing, though, diner!"
266635,496533,2014/4/16,4,"Made this tasty dish for breakfast this morning -- my first time to make poached eggs and they turned out pretty good.

We added chipotle chile to give it some heat and served with salsa, crema fresca, pico de gallo, onions, and tomatoes for garnish. Made for Football Pool 2013"
242766,508523,2014/1/10,5,"Yum!!  We loved these cheesy, creamy enchiladas!  They go together quickly and easily with ingredients that I always have on hand.  I used 2 chicken breasts and the larger amount (2 tsp.) of chili powder.  I also added 2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. Penzeys Spices &quot;Bold Taco&quot; seasoning to the sauce mixture.  I used 4-cheese Mexican blend cheese and used extra (about 1 cup) for the top.  I got 10 enchiladas instead of 6 and baked this in a 9&quot;x13&quot; pan. Delicious!!

I did use about 1 cup extra rhubarb to achieve that end.  This is delicious. I sweetened with Splenda and followed the recipe.  It&#039;s a real hit with my DH too but mine likes rhubarb so I knew this would be a shoe in. Made of PAC, Spring 2014."

578808,503712,2013/10/13,5,"This is now my &quot;go-to&quot; buttercream recipe!  It is so delicious!  My clients tell me it is every bit as good as the Italian Buttercream recipe that is so difficult to make, and uses twice the butter!  Thanks, Carmela, for the great recipe!"
1800148863,503011,2013/10/24,5,I did not use the boullions and it was still amazing.
2000333568,525169,2018/8/20,5,"Excellent, simple, easy, and delicious. I will definitely make this again!"
133174,496302,2013/3/1,5,This does make a yummy breakfast.  I recently participated in the spice swap and got a jar of sumac.  This recipe caught my attention and I'm so glad it did.  I did use non-stick pans and couldn't see using as much oil as called.  The potatoes were cooked in a small amount of olive oil and the eggs were prepared in a separate pan.  After the eggs were cooked the remaining liquid was poured over the potatoes and cooked off a bit before serving.  The dish was served with gluten free flour tortillas for a wonderful breakfast treat.  Made for Aussie Swap.
305531,507828,2014/5/2,4,Good roll ups. I used recipe #244848 for the alfredo sauce. Thanks for sharing this nice recipe. Made for Spring PAC 2014.

173579,494671,2013/12/12,5,Very good soup.  We thought the ranch mix just put it over the top.  Thanks for posting.
695933,506915,2013/11/13,5,"I think You need a BIG bowl for this one, it bubbles up...it goes WAY UP AND OVER THE TOP. But it very good, a keeper Thank you Grpa  DID PAM GET ON THIS! He He He He  UPDATE 11/13/13 She GOT YOU Ha Ha Ha&lt;br/&gt;What I did was&lt;br/&gt;Puree blueberries in blender or food processor.&lt;br/&gt;Place in a 12-cup microwave-safe dish with sugar and cinnamon.&lt;br/&gt;Stir.&lt;br/&gt;Microwave on High, uncovered, for 8-10 minutes -- until mixture comes to a full roiling boil and boils for one full minute.&lt;br/&gt;Stir well once during cooking.&lt;br/&gt;Remove from microwave and pour into sterilized jars.&lt;br/&gt;Cover and refrigerate.&lt;br/&gt;Keeps well for at least two weeks.&lt;br/&gt;You do like to play people mind !!"
768828,506915,2013/11/13,5,Awesome jam - I used blueberries.  The only problem is I made a half a recipe - should have made the whole one as it will be gone too soon.  Made for Pammyowl&#039;s Cookathon.
28177,506915,2013/11/15,5,"Delicious strawberry jam!  This recipe is super easy, but I&#039;ve just got to add another warning about using a big bowl.  I used a 6-inch wide bowl that is about 4 inches deep.  That was definitely not enough.  Before I knew it there was strawberry syrup everywhere in the microwave.  It smells delish, but was a huge mess.  LOL   I couldn&#039;t cook for more than 45 seconds before it overflowed, so I cut the power down to 50% and then cooked it a little bit longer each time.  I will definitely be making this again.  It is delicious on pancakes, toast and today we used it for Pammy&#039;s recipe #504210.  Made and enjoyed for the Cookathon in Pammy&#039;s memory."
461834,497616,2013/4/29,5,"Delicious!!!  You will love the smell of your kitchen while these biscuits are baking!!  I made this as written, even included a photo of the brand name cheese (as I live in FL and it is a common brand in our Publix, but I know up in Ohio, they didn&#039;t have there butter).  I made two changes, made 1/4 of the recipe and used Land O Lakes butter, as I didn&#039;t want to spend almost $5 dollars for 2 sticks of Kerrygold butter.  The only thing I would change, is to add the onion/leek mixture, cold butter and cheese all at once, then add the yogurt as needed to bring it all together.  My biscuits were so tasty but not as tender and I think it was from mixing the flour mixture with the butter 1st, then adding the cheese and onion/leek mixture and then the yogurt mixture, too much handling/mixing.  You must try these tasty biscuits!!!  I served mine with a bowl of homemade chili, so good!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Photo Tag Game."
2647890,495141,2013/4/21,4,"This is very good.  In place of lamb I used ground beef, beef broth, low sodium worcestershire sauce, and a store brand mashed potatoes.  I did use fresh thyme but didn&#039;t have the fresh rosemary on hand. Since I only had dried rosemary, I only used 1/8 tsp in the recipe."
169430,508547,2013/12/10,5,"Oh my goodness, SO good. I used 95% fat free cream cheese and whole wheat fettuccine and got a delicious meal. This was a great use for my fresh broccoli too. Not difficult at all and something that I would serve to company but also makes a pure home comfort dinner. This is on my Make Again Soon list."
1226388,504664,2013/8/4,5,"What a nice drink!  I usually like rum and coke, but this was really refreshing.  I liked the touch of mint and I wasn&#039;t sure I would.  I did use the lemon lime soda option because that is what I had on hand, but I&#039;ll try the ginger ale version too!  Made for ZWT9"
107135,504664,2013/8/5,5,simple tastes great used ginger ale zwt9 love ginger ale and rum
143721,504664,2013/8/5,5,Great simple and refreshing drink after a rough day.  I didn&#039;t have any mint so I added lime.  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;
482376,522852,2015/7/31,5,"This made for an absolutely declicious dinner!! I double the recipe, because we had 5 people, and it worked beautifully. The flavor is outstanding! I am putting this recipe into my Best of 2015 file. Thank you!"
296050,502175,2015/2/13,5,"I&#039;ve made this recipe twice now and both times the cookies have been a HUGE hit, especially with my grandchildren.  There&#039;s just something about chocolate, caramel and sea salt - YUMMY!!!  Oh, I&#039;ve also gotten 37 cookies out of the batch instead of 24 - so I&#039;m probably making them a bit smaller than called for but the good news with that is they are lower in calories and there&#039;s more to enjoy :) Thank you so much for posting amara800511 AKA Air Force Mama?"
2001018299,502175,2016/5/22,0,"I have a bag of caramel bits in my cupboard so I looked for a cookie recipe that has it and I came across this one. I made it and everybody loved it! We just love how the sea salt balances the sweetness of the sugar,caramel bits and choc chips. I'm definitely making it again :)"
2001105580,502175,2016/7/28,2,"Hi, I was so excited about making these cookies but they just didn't do it for me. The cookies ended up being flat and super greasy. I'm not sure if it was the caramel or maybe silicone baking mats, either way...they tasted good but were too greasy to serve to anyone."
88099,506696,2013/9/16,5,What a fun way to serve mashed potatoes.  I am probably not the best at making a Volcano but they tasted great.  I used seasoned salt for the salt but other than that made as directed and they were great.  Thanks so much for sharing.
654995,523868,2015/12/28,5,"Utterly delicious!  My family loves this dish.  It&#039;s become our favorite pasta.  Thanks for the great, flavorful recipe"
2000240054,520968,2015/6/1,1,These are awful. Super salty. Dense. And they look uncooked which I could deal with if the first 2 things weren&#039;t a factor. I used all purpose flour since the recipe doesn&#039;t specify but that&#039;s probably a mistake. I didn&#039;t realize it was an untested recipe. The ingredients were on hand so I wasn&#039;t out anything.  I also had to cook longer than stated as they were still a little raw after 15 mins. I can&#039;t recommend these.
2000262875,520968,2015/6/11,2,I had only one problem and that was they were way over salted. So much that it upset my stomach after two bites. But everything else was just fine.
2000270658,520968,2015/6/14,1,This recipe tastes like salty play dough.  
2000346724,520968,2015/7/18,5,"Great recipe. This will make a &#039;roll&#039; that is more like a very light and fluffy biscuit. Cooking time was way too short for me and more like 25 minutes. Those who say it is too salty should just cut back on how much they add. I used self rising flour so no need to add the baking soda and salt. Remember, if a recipe doesn&#039;t say &#039;heaping&#039; you should be using a level measure also. This recipe can also be used for some of the best pancakes you will ever eat. Add 2 teaspoon of sugar to the mix for them. You can get adventerous and add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon too. Adjust both to suit your taste. Makes about six 5&quot; pancakes. Cut the recipe in half and makes the perfect amount for one person."
2000492533,520968,2015/9/23,5,Im not a huge baker but needed something quick and easy for dinner. Instead of the mayonnaise I used sour cream and these rolls turned out phenomenal! My family loved them and will definitely make them again!
2000599806,520968,2015/10/24,0,"I didnt like these at all...They are way too salty, and they are very dense. Not light and fluffy like a roll should be... I will be discarding this recipe"
2000644290,520968,2015/11/5,4,"Really delicious!
But way too much salt.
I would HALF the salt it calls for.
I added rosemary and italian seasoning  and about 1/3 cup of water to help make the fluffier.

I would call them biscuits more than rolls, but the water made them fluffier than biscuits.

Loved them!"
2000850981,520968,2016/2/1,1,"I followed the recipe, exactly, and found there wasn&#039;t enough moisture. So I added 3 tbsp of milk. Was enough to have at least a sticky &quot;dough&quot;. They puff up nicely but taste awful, far too salty. My little boy, who normally loves salty things and bread of any sort, would not eat them....not too sure what to do ?"
2000985278,520968,2016/4/23,4,"I like this recipe. But, you have to be able to tweak things! Gosh how we are creatures of instant gratification, aren&#039;t we? LOL. So, half the salt and milk, and double the soda and mayo. If too dry add a half teaspoon of water until it comes together, if it&#039;s sticky, it&#039;s too wet. And, measure everything!! Nothing heaping! 3x the recipe for a family of 4+. You can roll and cut this, drop it, just make sure of three things, blend it VERY well, let it rest, covered, room temp for at least 30 mins, and bake for 21 mins. :)"
2001049058,520968,2016/6/13,0,"I wish I had read the comments before I made these! Their in the overnight, but I doubled the recipe AND the salt! Oh well'"
2001242541,520968,2016/11/12,1,Awful! So salty I couldn't even make myself swallow them.
2001075380,520968,2016/11/16,1,Mine didn't puff up and ended up more biscuit than roll. On the salty side. Bummer
2001303901,520968,2016/12/18,4,This is actually a very old and good beginners recipe - Correction to the original and why it is so salty is because it calls for 1/4 teaspoon of salt which at a teaspoons is super overkill. Just change to a 1/4 and enjoy :D
2001345292,520968,2017/1/10,4,"So this was the first time i made no yeast rolls. I like the recipe it came out really good. I read the reviews first so i knew what i was getting myself into lol i used half the salt like suggested and 1/3 cup of water like suggested. I also added rosemary, italian seasoning and thyme and i made a garlic butter that i put over the dough after i spooned it into the pan. Then when they were half done i put parmesan and the remaing of the garlic butter on top. They came out soooo tastey and fluffy! But it has more of a buiscuit consistancy and not like a roll."
2001369440,520968,2017/1/28,0,I just tried this recipe and I followed it up to how much salt. They taste ok but they never actually got that golden look. I used all purpose flour.
2001129388,520968,2017/4/30,1,This is not a Dinner roll its a Biscuit... Do not add salt mayo has enough in it.
2001910886,520968,2018/1/4,1,"I wish I had read the reviews first. I was looking for an easy go to for bread to go with spaghetti, they would be alright if made with A LOT LESS salt. I mixed garlic powder and herbs de Provence."
2002077614,520968,2018/3/26,0,"This is a sImple and easy recipe,, however, I doubled the ingredients for my needs."
2002147361,520968,2018/5/10,5,"I doubled the recipe.. used 1/2 the salt, substituted sour cream for the mayo and added cheese and bacon to spice up flavour.. grandkids approved!"
2001879142,520968,2018/11/17,1,"i do not understand this at all! a literal disaster! I found another recipe that called for self rising flour vs ap so I wonder if this was a misprint. Something is definately wrong with this recipe! No flavor, blonde, salt bomb..."
2585084,501170,2013/6/21,5,I wish I could give this more than five stars.  It was an absolutely wonderful dish.  All of the bits and pieces were pretty and worked well together.  I was surprised at how filling these lettuce tacos turned out to be.   I plan to add this to my best of 2013 cookbook.
128473,501170,2013/6/22,5,"What a lovely meal this recipe made.   The marinade was delicious, the chicken perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The chili sauce was dynamite, slightly salty, but delicious none the less. The flavor of the assembled taco was incredible, salty, tart and tangy, you could also taste the ginger and garlic, we loved it. We decided to use the cellophane noodles option. The tacos were a  little messy to eat but that was part of the fun.  I made them exactly as written but couldn&#039;t get bibb lettuce so  used a nice young romain lettuce, it worked pretty well.  Really great use of the contest ingredients, Good Luck in the contest."
58104,501170,2013/6/22,4,"Very good! Love it being low cal. A fun dish to make and eat. Yes a little messy but its all fun. I did use 2 breasts and did slice before marinading. Then after cooking I cooled and broke apart in small pieces for easy filling into the lettuce. As for the chili sauce I skipped the soy using only the fish soy, being the sodium is more then 1/2 of your DV. I didn&#039;t marinade long because the lime juice can make the chicken mush. So this step can be done first and and let sit while prepping the rest. You won`t lose any flavor. I did oil my pan before cooking the chicken as I don`t believe in non stick pans. I also added some sweet pea pods from the garden. As I chopped the nuts I thought adding some to the dipping sauce to thicken it a bit would have been good. I used fresh grown greens from the garden. I did add to the plate thinly slice jalapeno, onions, red bell peppers. And for the herbs I minced cilantro, basil, holy basil. To the cellophane noodles I added some of the sweet chili sauce to coat and flavor. Nice creation. Good luck."
542159,501170,2013/6/23,5,"Yum and double yum! I cut the recipe in half and did cut the chicken into thin strips and marinated 5 hours which was tasty and perfect, think 24 hours would have been too long for these thin strips and just as a matter of personal choice will cut the strips into thirds next time. Had some homemade sweet chili sauce left from yesterday that did not have ginger so add a teaspoon of fresh ginger and thought it went fantastic with these oh so yummy and oh so healthy Thai Tacos. This meal does make for one very pretty table and makes healthy eating fun. Good luck in the contest and thanks for the great post."
266635,501170,2013/8/22,5,These lettuce wraps are absolutely delish!  Loved all the flavors; especially the chili sauce.  I marinated the chicken overnight and had no problem with saltiness from the soy sauce.  Took the advice of one reviewer and added some chopped peanuts to the chili sauce.  This makes a wonderful light lunch that is very satisfying.  Made for ZWT9.
174096,501170,2013/8/26,5,"These are great!  Colorful, crunchy, and flavorful.  We enjoyed all the textures and how well everything came together.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
1803116783,521391,2016/4/13,5,Delicious! Turned out great. Will be making this one again.
482376,527467,2016/7/23,5,"Such an easy recipe and such great flavor! We all loved the chicken and green onions. The flavor reminded me of the yakitori we have gotten at the EPCOT Japan pavillion, which is always a favorite of ours. This was a perfect recipe for us tonight because it is very hot outside and most of this was done quickly on the grill. Served over rice. Thank you!"
135470,527467,2016/7/24,5,"Yum, this was super delicious. I cheated a little by using whole chicken thighs, I grilled them over direct heat at first then moved them off and used indirect. I didn't pay attention and over grilled my green onions but the centers were still tasty. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 by one of the Iota Eta Pi"
227978,527467,2016/7/28,5,"Awesome, PanNan. I had a package of thighs and breasts, so I had a nice combination to choose from once I got this to the table. And I decided to broil them in my oven instead of grill, and I really liked that the sauce kept the chicken breasts so nicely moist throughout the broiling. It was really good. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 (Japan)."
204024,527467,2018/7/6,5,We made this for dinner last night. I had some boneless pork chops to use up. I just cut the port chops up into cubes. this worked great. We put them on spears with some pineapple we had leftover from another recipe. Love this recipe.
169430,501425,2014/2/21,5,I&#039;ve really come to prefer potato salad with no mayo and this is a perfect example of why. Great taste and so much less fat. It just feels and tastes so much lighter. I&#039;m looking forward to summer grilling with this salad on the side. :D
2001893789,532640,2017/12/27,0,I would like to try out the honey pork roast but I have not got a slow cooker and neither have i got where to store it if i did..... Do you think that it could work if i tried cooking the same recipe in a double roasting tins (bain marie) style! I could have some water in the outer one and the recipe in the inner one which covers with a lid! Also at what temperature?
2324285,499009,2013/5/19,4,"Pretty good!  I could not find goat cheddar or mozzarella, so I just used crumbled goat cheese and regular mozzarella.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, although I next time I&#039;d like to leave the marinara sauce out of the filling as it made it taste kind of strange.  It could be just because I used store-bought marinara sauce-  I wanted to make my own, but just didn&#039;t have the time.  Thanks for sharing!"
169430,501919,2014/5/9,5,"This is nothing short of fine dining. Since I was only making one lobster tail I needed to steam it with plain water as 1/4 cup of liquid would have boiled away in no time. I just made the butter sauce and used it in a small dish on the plate for dipping. Simply delicious, lobster, is for me, a seldom enjoyed special treat and every bite was a bit of pure pleasure. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
478712,501919,2014/9/7,5,"This recipe is fantastic. Anything that is this easy, with delicious, company-worthy results earns five stars without question. I only had 4 small lobster"
518054,501919,2014/12/30,5,"I wanted to taste the combination of garlic, wine and butter before committing beautiful lobster.  It was delicious!  I used a 2011 Procrastinate Pinot Grigio as my white wine and actually drank some while simmering the sauce.  I&#039;m not big on wine typically but I drank this.  Your sauce will be served with my lobster.  Thanks for something so tasty and easy."
724631,512481,2014/4/18,5,"Great WW recipe that tastes great with no artificial sugars!  This makes about 3 servings for us, but we would double the veggies in the future.  It tasted bright and cheery, very spring-like!  Note: I used 1 Tablespoon finely grated ginger, but because I used a Microplane grater, I should have stopped at 2 teaspoons, it was a little intense.  (Rule of thumb: 1 tablespoon = 1 inch of ginger.)  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
1060667,512481,2014/6/8,4,This is really good!  Instead of brown rice I served this over whole wheat couscous.  I garnished with chopped green onion and sesame seeds. Thanks :)
2688977,494784,2013/2/12,5,Looks fresh and delish!
2000429156,510429,2015/8/25,5,Very simple and delicious recipe!! We will be eating this often.
2000459183,510429,2015/9/7,5,Great recipe! Very easy to prepare and cook! I used mozzarella instead of parmesean. I also add Monterey chicken seasoning and used butter garlic croutons instead of bread crumbs. Baked beautifully. My super picky husband asked if he could have all the left overs. Definitely adding this to the monthly meals list!!!
280271,503887,2013/10/1,5,Delicious! I cooked it in a cast iron skillet a 10 inch one...I melted the stick of butter in the pan while the oven heated up...by the time I had all the ingredients mixed in a bowl the oven was preheated and the butter was melted...I cooked the cornbread for 30 mins even though the pan was a bit larger...came out perfect...hubby said this was the best corn bread he ever had...he just loved the crusty bottom and sides of the bread...I served it with butter on the side...but neither hubby or I used it...the bread is packed full of butter flavor...made it to go along with my recipe #159563...it&#039;s a keeper and going in my best of 2013 cookbook...thanks for posting it...=)
169430,503887,2013/11/9,5,Loved this :D. I made it with no sugar as I don&#039;t care for sweet cornbread. The texture is excellent and so is the taste it went very well indeed with Recipe #306337. Very easy to make and it should be a hit with the entire family. :D
204024,503887,2013/11/17,5,"We loved the flavor, texture, and especially the color of this cornbread, which we cooked in a 13x9 glass baking dish.  We got a sweet, smooth, cake-like cornbread a little reminiscent of Marie Callender&#039;s. We made it explicitly to use half in a turkey stuffing, and it was a little on the sweet side for that, but perfect for eating.  I don&#039;t know if we&#039;ve made another cornbread with buttermilk, but it worked great!  Made for Name That Ingredient tag game."
128473,503887,2013/11/19,5,"Thank you so much for sharing this lovley recipe Chef GRPA it makes a wonderful cornbread.  It was perfect, beautiful flavor and texture.  Loved the crispy bits.  It was quick and easy to make with great results.  The cornbread was excellent served with meatloaf, silver dollar fries and steamed vegetables.  I can&#039;t wait to add this into stuffing, I love cornbread in my stuffing and will keep the rest for that."
2597942,503887,2013/11/26,5,"First, I must confess... I am not a huge fan of cornbread, but I must admit, this is tasty. I made this tonight (as written steps #1 thru #3, the rest had me confused a bit). I made this basically as a test-run for our up-coming Thanksgiving dinner. I made this as a side for Recipe #506030 (along with a couple other sides), and it went very well. I also made your Recipe #497916 to use with the cornbread, but I think that was over-kill. It seemed way too sweet with the 2 recipes combined. The corn bread was fine with plain butter. (Don&#039;t get me wrong, the Recipe #497916 would be great on plain rolls or even toast for breakfast, but just a bit much here). Hubby and I (along with a guest) very much enjoyed the cornbread with dinner. And I should say that this WILL be gracing our table on Thanksgiving Day. Thank you for posting... I have it saved. (Made for PRMR)"
724631,503887,2013/12/21,5,"&quot;Best cornbread I have ever had!&quot;, declared DH. This was decidedly sweet, almost like cake. The recipe produces 4 cups of batter.  I used Paula Deen specialty cornbread cast iron molds (6 together) which took about 1/2 cup batter for each mold (although I learned it is wiser not to overfill).  This was so easy to put together, using my stovetop skillet as a mixing bowl as Chef GRPA explained while the cast iron molds preheated in the oven.  My only problem is that I will have to make 2 times the recipe to feed 4 of our bread-loving family.  Thank you for sharing this gem!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
679953,503887,2014/1/11,5,"WOW !!  This is wonderful cornbread.  I used a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Made for a great dinner along with some chicken noodle soup.  I don&#039;t recall making cornbread with buttetmilk, but this will have to be made again.  This recipe will be invited to my home during the winter holidays.  It was fabulous.  Made for PRMR Tag."
786083,503887,2014/12/25,5,"This is my go-to cornbread recipe from now on, I made it for tomorrows dressing but will have to make more, this will not last til then...Cooked in a 9 inch cast iron , pre heated skillet, 35 minutes and perfect."

1663024,510849,2014/11/15,5,"Twenty minutes perfectly crisped and browned my thick-sliced applewood smoked bacon. I did not use parchment paper because like you, I save my bacon grease (I fry cabbage in rendered bacon fat for incredible flavor.) Also, as your author&#039;s note states, I always cook with love. Thank you, xtine, for Perfect Oven-Cooked Bacon."
2000935501,510849,2017/7/5,0,The bacon was very good but it did stick to the pan. I think next time I may try to use a little cooking spray. Anyone think this will work or not?
1112848,494784,2013/2/25,5,over the top nice job!
2688795,494784,2013/2/25,5,Delicious!

2667917,495702,2013/2/18,5,These taste great!
2000431901,530286,2017/2/23,4,"Wouldn't want to make these on a regular basis, but very fun for a once in a while treat and a nice twist on waffles."
2562280,499609,2014/5/24,1,"Either something is missing from this recipe or the amount of the flours specified is wrong. If you follow the recipe, it turns into a dry dough, not batter!! The recipe calls for 50 grams each of coconut and almond flours. Normally flour is specified in a volume measurement, not a weight measurement like grams. But using grams and following the specified weight to volume indication on the respective packages of the two flours, the recipe translates into approximately 1/2 cup each of the two flours for a total of 1 cup of flour. 1 pkg of cream cheese, 3 tbsp of butter and 2 eggs are not nearly enough moisture for 1 cup of flour to create a batter. It is not even enough moisture for a dough!!! Since the result of the recipe was too dry to pour, I attempted to spoon the dough into the waffle iron. The messy result was 1 1/2 extremely dry waffles!!!"
1803533368,499609,2014/12/21,0,"I&#039;m sorry, but I have to comment on the last comment..... this recipe calls for .11 lbs of each flour,. .11 lbs = 1.76oz 2 oz = 1/4 cup which means the previous person put double the amount of flour in their recipe"
2002216546,515968,2018/7/13,0,This recipe is more or less taken directly from &quot;Jerusalem&quot; Yottam Ottolenghi - he should be credited. There are minor changes but the original should be given due credit.
2001527927,498325,2017/5/8,0,Where can I buy sugar beans please. I can find all other beans but not sugar beans.
2001450972,530645,2017/3/22,0,Is the shrimp precooked?
2399085,513291,2014/2/22,5,PRMR!!! I made the Classic Chili version. I did use my own homemade chili and made these. I also left out the sour cream as I do not like that in my chili. This brings back good memories of younger as we ate chili cheese fries often We still love them. Thanks
179133,513291,2014/4/27,5,"I love fries dipped in mayo, and paprika is one of my favorite spices so the Tapas-Style was right up my alley :) I used lime juice as it was what I had on hand. Used it as more of a dipping sauce than a topping. Nicely spicy from the paprika (brought it back from Hungary a few years ago - still just as spicy as when purchased!) Thanks for the recipe!"
305531,513291,2014/12/23,5,"Yum. I made the Classic Chili version and we enjoyed these while watching a football game. I made some homemade oven fries and we munched our way thru them. Thanks for sharing, Nancy. Congrats on your football win!!"
280271,513291,2017/5/11,0,5 stars...I made the Tapas - Style version...the hubby loved it...served it with grill potato wedges...made for &quot;Went to Market&quot; tag game...
50509,498523,2013/4/15,4,"A nice, basic spritzer. The lemon or lime juice adds a nice touch. I used a cherry sparkling water, which was not sweetened, so I also added a good splash of orange juice. That added some interest to the drink. Very refreshing on one of our first warm days."
128473,498523,2013/5/8,4,"A nice subtle flavored drink. I have never tried zindandel with lemon-lime soda and lemon juice before, it was pleasant and refreshing. Quick and easy to make.  Thank you for sharing your recipe."
169430,498523,2013/5/30,4,A very pleasant glass. I used strawberry zinfandel and club soda (couldn&#039;t find diet Sprite or 7-up!) with the lemon juice and a sliced strawberry added to the glass. Not a lot of punch to the flavor but still an enjoyable summer mix. Rather pretty too.
169430,503136,2014/1/7,5,"What a great lunch I had. This recipe is delicious, in my book it&#039;s very hard to go wrong with eggs, peppers and spice. It was warming, satisfying, and wold make a welcome meal at any time of the day or evening. I&#039;m glad that I had harrisa already on hand as I needed so little for just me (if you don&#039;t there are recipes for it here on Food). I enjoyed it with a mug of mint tea. Made for Baby Kato&#039;s win in Sweet December Event 2013. :D"
1802878890,509601,2014/7/2,5,Love love loveeeeeeee it !
226863,506883,2013/9/23,5,Delicious!  And so easy to make.  I ended up with 3 tortillas instead of 4....my cake pan wasn&#039;t big enough!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR Tag game.
212609,506883,2013/11/22,5,"This may be basic , but that doesn&#039;t mean that it doesn&#039;t deliver on taste.&lt;br/&gt;I loved how easily this dish came together...perfect for a busy week night supper.....we served with crisp salad, and an ice cold Corona....PERFECT!!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
305531,506883,2013/12/10,5,Yummy good. Reminded us of a Taco Bell Mexican Pizza. I baked mine in an 8x8 square (tortillas barely fit) but it was very easy and very good. Will be made again. Thanks nochlo for a nice keeper. Made for PRMR Tag.
1250369,506883,2014/1/3,5,"Hubby and I love this. I leave out the beans (hubby does not like them). I add sour cream, onions, lettuce and tomatoes on top after it is baked."
314579,503478,2017/9/3,5,"Loved loved loved this! I think the yummy buttery toast added a lot to the easy to make shrimp salad. I used really good European butter. Sadly, I bought the fish roe and forgot to put it on the shrimp. I think without the roe it needs salt (there's none in the recipe), but I'll make again and make sure I don't forget the eggs! (And I'm lousy at conversions, but if my scale is correct, 50 grams of dill would be a LOT, like a cup...but I could be wrong?). Thanks BK for posting, will make again, especially for entertaining! Made for CQ 2017, Scandinavia."
461834,505611,2013/8/16,5,"Fantastic!!!  I made the marinade and let the pork marinade for 1-2 hours before grilling.  OMG!!  The smell while this was on the grill was so wonderful, it will bring your neighbors over asking what you are grilling!!  I served this with some rice and green beans for a wonderful dinner.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, which we will make again!  Made for ZWT 9."
1287956,503823,2013/7/15,5,"We&#039;re not really quiche people, but I made it for my anniversary, and my hubby liked it so much, that he had seconds!  I used some bacon, and cooked that, using the bacon fat to cook the onions.  I also cheated, and just used a Pillsbury pie crust, so it made the dish really easy."
306726,517863,2014/8/19,5,Love these tasty little burgers!
2001051242,537716,2018/12/6,5,These were the best game day sandwiches. I could probably eat 50 and feel fantastic about it.
440735,502881,2013/8/5,5,Yummy!  The garlic was fabulous in these potatoes; more garlic will be added next time. I think the &quot;orange sweet potatoes&quot; could be used but that is personal preference. Made for ZWT9 for the Gourmet Goddesses July 2013.
1925885,502881,2013/8/7,5,"Mmmm, these were good!  This is the first time I&#039;ve had sweet potato mash with garlic in it.  Will never make it any other way again!  I don&#039;t mind the white sweet potatoes - it&#039;s all you can get here.  Other than the color being a bit off sometimes, I like the way they taste.  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT9 for the Gourmet Goddesses."
305531,502881,2016/8/7,5,"Yummy potatoes. We love roasted garlic and this was a perfect way to have some. Thanks for sharing, Lynn. Made for CQ3 - Bahamas."
157425,502881,2016/8/8,5,Couldnt find yellow sweet potatoes but wanted to try this recipe so I used yams and loved them. Used half and half instead of whipping cream and whipped everything together with my electric hand mixer. Put the potatoes back in a pot to heat thru before serving. If I ever spot yellow sweet potatoes will have to try them too. Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest 2016 - Bahamas.
266635,502881,2018/5/21,5,"What a wonderful way to make sweet potatoes and I would have never thought that roasted garlic would go well with them. Boy, was I ever wrong -- they are addictively delicious. This recipe is headed to my Best of 2018 file for sure. Soooo good!"
679953,504038,2014/11/28,5,"I did cut back on the paprika, I used 3 1/2 tablespoons, and used it on some turkey soup.  The flavor was good, and at the beginning of the month, when I go to the meat market in Michigan I will be using this on some steaks, and chicken."
527607,504038,2015/7/30,5,"Finally an easy and yummy creole dish, so pleased with it"
1925885,504038,2016/7/29,5,"Great creole seasoning, and an added plus is that the ingredients are common to most pantries. I didn't need as much as this makes, so instead of tablespoons, I used teaspoons as the measure. Made about 1/2 cup - perfect! I needed this as a jerk seasoning, so I added a little allspice, cloves cinnamon, and nutmeg to the mix. Thanks for posting!"
690623,504038,2016/8/4,5,"What a great little recipe to have on hand! A breeze to put together, worked perfectly in the recipe I was making and I can see how this will be very versatile. Thanks for posting!"
169430,515793,2014/5/10,4,"Very nice cookies that I liked a lot. I did adapt just a bit by melting some bittersweet chocolate and mixing it in to have chocolate cookies instead of chocolate chip. The title says dark chocolate cookies and that was what got my attention so I was a bit disappointed to find they are chip chip yet again. That said, I enjoyed the semolina and white flour blend as well as the dark chocolate and anise. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
239758,502881,2018/10/22,5,"I wanted to serve this today with a slow-cooked beef casserole, so used the orange sweet potatoes I already had on hand. Besides, white sweet potatoes aren’t all that common in Australia. It was for just two of us, so I used 2 medium-sized sweet potatoes, 5 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 1/2 tablespoons of whipping cream. Hubby said, ‘This is so good, what’s that extra added flavour?’ and I knew he meant the roasted garlic. A truly delicious way to make sweet potatoes. Will make often."
80353,503485,2013/7/20,5,This made a delicious melitzanosalata.  I have never made one using breadcrumbs before but it made for a very light rendition that worked beautifully with the aromatics and tomato.  Loved this.
2002220758,536345,2018/7/17,5,"Delicious, especially with heirloom tomatoes. I will fix again."
2002225247,536345,2018/7/21,5,I made this at home me and my wife loved will be making it again!!
1072593,494195,2015/1/27,5,"Wow, the list of ingredients is loooooong.  I was beginning to think you were really that long-winded front person for the Home Shopping Network. ;-) Made with a few modifications, but still STUPENDOUS flavor!"
542159,505661,2016/8/6,4,"The basil bed was a refreshing change. I somehow forgot the carrot (eye roll), I enjoyed the flavor combo but DH said he would have preferred parsley to coriander. You are right the flavors in this come together in a surprising way. Thanks for the post."
222564,505661,2016/11/18,5,"This salad has a huge appeal to me with the nuts and herbs and oriental dressing. I thought the dressing would have been enough for maybe only one serving, so I tripled it. Not too much of it, at all, it's so yummy!"
1620171,507566,2013/10/25,5,Made as written for My Three Chef&#039;s 2013. Delicious and worth the trouble of finding the aussie spices. I would double the vegemite next time though.
37449,508316,2013/11/20,5,Made this and enjoyed it. I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip. Thanks!
1783373,508316,2014/5/7,5,"So good rosie316!  You are right about letting it sit overnight, as the flavors meld into the cabbage.  We enjoyed this with burgers and next time your coleslaw will be adjoining fried chicken!  And for the next cookout this will be on the menu, as I want to show off.  Thank you rosie316 for a great addition to my recipe files.  Made it for PRMR."
45342923,500454,2015/1/27,5,"I made these for a party, and they were a huge hit. My first time making tamales, and I learned a few things. First, make sure the corn husks are patted dry, and plan on patting on the masa rather than trying to spread it. I found that I needed to use less than the 1/4 c. called for (I was only able to make 30 tamales and I had a hard time fitting them on a corn husk). Second, in the future, I think I will use two corn husks placed vertically on top of one another (does that make sense?) in order to have a longer fold-up on the bottom. Since my fold-ups were small using one corn husk, I tied them at the bottom and then closer to the top. Also, I used 2/3 shoulder meat and 1/3 sirloin roast, so I had a slightly leaner mixture, which worked great. We&#039;ll definitely do these again."
2000166611,503359,2015/4/26,5,"I too lived in Jordan, but couldn&#039;t recreate an authentic tasting hummous till now. I used fresh lemon juice &amp; garlic. Found the tricks of heating the canned beans &amp; adding ice really helpful."
2001043708,503359,2016/6/9,3,"This hummus is close to what we had while living in Jordan but not quite. The texture was good but we are not used to seeing black specks in our hummus(pepper). This was my first time using garlic powder, fresh garlic is usually what we use. Hubby is Jordanian so I figured I'd get some good input. Next time we will omit the black pepper and use more lemon juice. This recipe seemed a bit bland compared to what we are used to."
437598,513617,2017/6/15,5,"I made this yesterday and it is delicious. I didn't have any almond butter, so I made my own in the food processor. I also doubled the recipe. I also used liquid stevia for the sweetener. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It is a keeper. Every one liked it, thanks."
2001359614,530601,2017/4/8,5,"My mom had millions of variations on this same theme. Always a crowd pleaser no matter what you use, plus the presentation can be so pretty! For your lactose intollerent buddies, I just do meat and veggie versions. Sping and summer are perfect for different fruit kabobs too. I always do a &quot;nibbles&quot; party where we make tons of food like this then sit around all afternoon / evening enjoying each others company! Excellent share!"
482933,512904,2014/3/5,5,"What a nice recipe! Definitely delicious, attractive, and nice combination of flavors.  Hubby said dinner was really good and appreciated having a salad here on a warm day. Served with recipe#439695 and the two complimented each other well. Thank you for sharing."
1072593,512904,2015/9/28,5,"Easy for me to throw this together for a last-minute dinner.  Dr. John said it best:  
My head was in a bad place 
But I&#039;m having such a good time..."
526666,494394,2013/2/20,5,"Loved it! Smeared it on my burger AND dipped my fries in it...kinda like an aioli. Made as directed - thanks for sharing another keeper, breezermom!"
2585084,494394,2013/4/11,5,"Yum,  so quick and simple.  It adds flair to a humble sandwich. I had it on roast beef and rye bread.  What I really liked about this mayo is that it got me thinking about other combinations that I can use from my herb garden."
37449,494394,2013/4/12,5,Easy and yummy! I used on a sandwich and loved it. Thanks! Made for Rookie Tag.
169430,494394,2013/4/24,5,Yummy mayo that I made to use with burgers tonight. So easy and quick that there really isn&#039;t any reason not not to add this to your regular mayo thats always in the fridge. A+ from me.
54678,494394,2013/6/11,5,garlic chives and extra garlic turned my burger into &quot;&quot;&quot;Wowser&quot;&quot;
383346,494394,2013/7/2,5,It&#039;s amazing how the taste could be so good with storebough mayonnaise :)  The garlic and chives adds so much to a plain mayonnaise.  I would do that very often this summer with my fresh chives.  Thanks breezermom :)  Made for Photo tag game
143721,494394,2013/11/8,5,"Made this up last night!  Used it on my sandwich for work today, ham and american cheese on wheat.  VERY NICE!!!  And since there is still some left over, I plan on having it again over the weekend.  Other nice thing is that I got to use the chives right from my garden!  Made for Football Pool, 2013."
2597942,494394,2013/12/2,5,"What a great sandwich spread. I made this at the end of last week, but didn&#039;t use it until the weekend (over 24 hours for the flavors to blend). WOW... the garlic definitely shines through. Hubby used it on a left-over Thanksgiving turkey sandwich, but I used it on a roast beef and lettuce sandwich. It was a nice change from plain mayo or horseradish on a roast beef sandwich, and hubby enjoyed it on his as well. Thank you for posting. (Made for Football Pool week 12 win)"
204024,494394,2014/3/29,5,Easy and Delicious.  Used this on a breakfast sandwich.   Made for PRMR.
226867,494394,2014/11/5,5,Oh yeah! This was great on a venison-summer sausage sammi on sourdough bread! Made for breezer&#039;s football win 2014.
157425,494394,2015/10/28,5,A very nice change of pace from our typical sandwich spreads. Had a ham on rye sandwich and loved it! Cant wait to use it on burgers and anything else I can find. Will be making again breezermom thank you for posting. Made and reviewed for the For Your Consideration tag game.
212609,513170,2014/3/25,5,"This turned out to be a speedy Saturday night treat for the family, that we all enjoyed enormously.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for another simple, quick and very tasty recipe.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
305531,505497,2014/3/8,5,"Delish!  This was really simple to make. I enjoyed using the peach juice for part of the dredging and as an addition to the stuffing. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper, Rosie. Made for PRMR Tag."
88099,505497,2013/8/14,5,This review is for the peaches and pork chops only as we didn&#039;t care for the pork stuffing mix which I knew we wouldn&#039;t.  But the peachy pork chops were excellent.  Cooked an extra 5 minutes with the peaches and the butter-flied chops turned out so moist and tender.  Just excellent.  I would like to try it with pineapple next time just as written to see if that works.  We served this with green beans and garlic bread and the stuffing mix.  Thanks so much for sharing your family recipe.  I&#039;ll make this again.  Thanks
1706426,505497,2013/8/18,5,"I loved the simplicity of this delicious recipe, and the fact that nothing was wasted, not even the peach juice! The idea of making the stuffing with it is great. I usually have pork with applesauce so this was a nice change.  Oh, BTW, I used pork tenderloin slices 1/2&quot; thick and the cook time was spot on! Thanks for sharing! Made for New Kids on the Block, 2013"
227978,505497,2013/12/24,5,"This was delicious, and quite easy to make.  I didn&#039;t make the optional stuffing (we just wanted the pork chops).  And I added the sliced peaches at the beginning, so they cooked a little longer than the recipe states.  But other than that slight change, I made the recipe as originally written.  Dredging the chops first in the peach juice added a nice touch.  Thanks rosie316.  Made for your week 16 win in the 2013 Football Pool."
488441,505497,2013/12/31,5,"Really easy. Really tasty. Should be a hit with kids, too! Made for Football Pool 2013"
163112,505497,2014/9/6,5,"Awesome! *I* love shake&#039;n&#039;bake!  the almost ex claims to hate it but I caught him trying to snag seconds.  twit.  Anyway, these came out perfect!  The only sad part was I needed both packets of seasoning.  i had 5 large bone in chops.  They cooked to PERFECTION.  I started them at 20 minutes, added the peaches for 10 then let them rest for 5.  I only put the heat at 400F.  Did not make the stuffing, though.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ."
2001080830,527452,2016/7/9,5,This turned out great! I added a heavy pinch of red pepper to make it really spicy. I'd eat it on anything.
1801795884,525061,2018/12/15,5,A simple and easy recipe for the coconut lovers such as myself. I drizzled a tiny bit of chocolate over each one as I was bringing them to a baptism brunch and wanted to jazz them up a little bit. Thanks Bonnie~
1152562,521682,2015/12/14,1,These weren&#039;t the thumbprint cookies I&#039;d hoped for. If you make these don&#039;t bake more than 12-14 min.
1802297904,494294,2014/1/13,5,"These baked up well.  Second day, they still tasted great."
1803530502,494294,2014/12/20,5,"Made these today for my family and what a hit it was! I made adjustments for my preferences and those were as follows: I used unsalted butter; I used almond milk. This made two pans of biscuits using the drop method and they were a little darker than bleached flour biscuits, but my family has eaten spelt flour items before so they didn&#039;t mind. The bottom of them was so crusty and yummy I wanted to eat the bottoms off all of them. :) Wonderful flavor. I cooked my biscuits for about 13 minutes and next time will do 15. I like them crusty. ENJOY. I will post a photo of them right out of the oven."
2000531887,494294,2015/10/6,5,"fantastic flavor, easy, go good with so many things ::: I made with organic sprouted spelt, grass fed butter and slightly soured raw milk /// made a bit smaller, baked for 15, ate three immediately :)"
137302,496075,2014/4/12,5,These ribs are very good and easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was that I baked my ribs at 325 degrees during the second baking since my ribs were pretty thick with meat.  We really enjoyed them.  The sauce gives a sweet/sour type of bbq sauce and creates a really great tasty and tender rib.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
2000619128,524229,2016/9/26,5,"My goodness!! This was an absolutely amazing soup! I was a little skeptical about the butternut squash, but it turned out to be a delicious soup. It had this Indian curry flavor. My kids suggested that we make some basmati rice and pour the soup over it next time. I added a hint of Garam Masala spice, just to add to the Indian flavor. Thanks again for the recipe. We will be making this soup over and over again!!"
47559,517638,2014/8/10,4,This was a quick and easy fried chicken recipe with a beautiful light crispy crust.  We really enjoyed it for our U.S. Southern meal for the Culinary Quest.
305531,517638,2014/8/13,5,Yum! I haven&#039;t made &#039;real&#039; fried chicken in a very long time. I&#039;ve been kind of stuck on the oven fried variety for the last couple of years. I totally enjoyed this dinner. Thanks for sharing this wonderful keeper that I will be sure to repeat. Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
195616,529577,2016/12/27,0,This is an old Pillsbury bake off winning recipe. I made them over 40 years ago when my children were growing up and they loved them!

724631,509461,2013/12/9,3,"As written, not inspiring except to feed Weight Watcher dieters who could count it as dairy.  How can you effectively adjust the sweetness prior to adding the yogurt?  I used whole milk, does that account for the bland output?  I thought this needed a much more distinctive chocolate, perhaps bittersweet.  When I unmolded my panna cotta, it was bland.  I could have sprinkled sugar on top (as I normally treat plain Greek yogurt), but if only the instructions had suggested to pour more Hershey&#039;s chocolate syrup over the panna cotta in a decorative design (as my photo shows)!  This was an experiment, because this recipe was SO EASY, but I think I need to work a little harder for my chocolate panna cotta to suit me.  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag."
1803747530,520005,2015/2/4,2,Won&#039;t make these again. Awful texture. Waste of ingredients.
2000468193,520005,2015/9/11,5,"I made these for my husband who is Type II diabetic.  It appealed to me as it has very little sugar (I substituted Stevia for the sugar).  He loved them!  Not too sweet, but very tasty!"
2001869834,520005,2017/12/19,5,"Remarkably simple and delicious! Will definitely make them again. So easy to make the cookies ahead and freeze, then bake when you need them!"
37449,505585,2013/8/16,5,I don&#039;t think I would call this a salad but it was very good.  I made it for breakfast and enjoyed the  North African spices. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by one of the Hot Stuff.

1419314,495396,2013/2/23,5,"This was a most delicious recipe.... and so thoughtfully written--an example being to be careful not to burn the garlic (something I am always doing!).  To have so many delectable flavors for the taste buds plus to be good for you is a treat indeed.  The big bonus for me was to be introduced to the Quorn brand.  I had seen this in the frozen section at Sprouts but always passed it by.  I almost always am very disappointed in meat substitutes.  I followed Ms. Wanda's suggestion and tried their chunks, and she's right--you would never know it's not chicken--except it's more tender than chicken!  My husband loved this dish, and was disappointed I had frozen the remainder--he wanted to keep eating it meal after meal.  Thank you for giving us a wonderful alternative to a meat based meal without us feeling the least deprived!"
461834,499207,2013/5/4,4,"Nice breakfast casserole and so great that you can assemble it the day before you plan to serve it.  I made 1/4 of the recipe, used Jimmy Dean sausage, 1 regular egg and the rest used &quot;Egg Beaters&quot;, a combo of cheddar and Monterey Jack, &quot;Simply Hash Browns&quot; and I added my own chopped onion and red bell pepper.  I did add the optional hot sauce, and did a couple of dashes, but I couldn&#039;t even tell it was in the casserole.  So if you are making the full casserole, suggest using a lot more then a dash of the hot sauce if you want a little zip.  I served mine with a fresh fruit salad and blueberry muffins for a very enjoyable brunch!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
2597942,499207,2013/5/5,5,"I pre-mixed this late last night, and let it sit in fridge over night to bake this morning. This turned out just lovely! I followed the recipe exactly, and I would not change a thing. I used a 1# tube of &#039;regular&#039; Jimmy Dean sausage (although I thought about trying a flavored one). This makes a ton... but that&#039;s okay. Our neighbors across the street just got home very last night from their trip to China (which is why I prepped this at midnight). We had them and our other 2 neighbors all over for breakfast this morning, and we still have leftovers (now hubby can just &#039;nuke&#039; a couple slices tomorrow morning to eat on his way to work)! I&#039;m thinking this would be great for a Mothers&#039; Day Brunch... HMMMM? Thank you for posting a very easy and delicious breakfast entree."
2001924722,499207,2018/1/11,3,"2 cups of milk. My husband and I both agreed that it sounded like too much, but we followed the recipe anyways. It does taste good, but the milk made it too soupy in my opinion. It definitely took more than an hour.... our oven does run a little low. After the hour was finished i turned it up to 375 (should've done that in the first place) for almost another half hour."
47559,499843,2013/8/3,4,"This was a very cool and refreshing salad to eat on a hot summer night.  The flavor was excellent.  For my personal taste, when making it again, I would decrease the sour cream a bit and add a touch more white wine vinegar to thin the dressing somewhat. Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers ZWT 9."
1706426,499843,2013/8/3,4,"I do agree with the previous reviewer, the cream sauce needs to be thinned out, so I did that with a bit more vinegar and it was very good. Made for ZWT9"

285039,502465,2013/11/9,5,Quick little pick me up healthy snack with just 2 Weight Watchers points per serving.  This made 25.  I used dark chocolate chips and omitted the pumpkin seeds.  I think it would be even more awesome with toasted chopped walnuts instead of sunflower seeds.
227652,506068,2013/10/10,5,"This was a really great recipe! Am always on the lookout for new ways to use lentils--so healthy &amp; inexpensive! I DID change the spice amounts--upped them to add more flavor. For the meatballs, I used parmesan cheese in place of the olive oil mayo, which I didn&#039;t use. I used 3/4 tsp garam masala &amp; added 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I used dried parsley &amp; left out the lemon--used lean ground turkey &amp; used less black pepper. For the stew, I left out the potato (personal preference; I may include it next time!), upped all the spices &amp; used regular lentils. I needed about 1/2 more water to keep the broth going--and the lentils look about 30 min to cook at a hard boil. Served w/ whole wheat naan bread. Thanks so much for sharing!"
226867,532420,2017/7/21,5,"Very tasty! I wasn't sure about flipping the skillet and since I made this for 2 people, the pancake was small enough to carefully flip with my spatula. I had raspberries on hand, so used instead of the blackberries."
135470,532420,2017/8/6,5,"Yum , this made a lovely late evening dinner. I cut the recipe to 2 serving which I ate all of! (I don't think half would have been quits a full serving) . This is a dense pancake which has the slight taste of a sweet omelette. I loved the caramelized peach and berries mixed in with the pancake and only wished I had used a larger peach. The directions were very clear and easy to follow. Made for Culinary Quest 4 by one of the Spice Girls"
58104,495752,2013/3/19,5,"This recipe does need a tender touch! First you need to saute the onions first then the garlic in bacon fat. Garlic would burn and make the soup bitter. I did use this Recipe #107440 for cooking the bacon using organic bacon! I used frozen green beans not a fan of canned unless I canned my fresh grown and picked from my garden. Used my green herb mix Recipe #396007 in place of the salt and Italian seasoning. I did add the potatoes (purple, red and white) to the onions along with the diced carrots so it would be cooked as the recipe didn`t state cooked veggies just put them in and serve. Then the recipe is to serve 4 so I upped the broth from 1 cup to (home made with organic grass fed beef broth) 4-5 cups. I then simmered the veggies in the broth till tender. I did pre cook the Stelline pasta then added to the soup. Because I knew one cup dried (what recipe called for) would have made this so thick it would not have been soup! Using 6 ounces of pasta which is 3 servings. I did serve with roasted garlic bread and garnished with crisp bacon pieces. I must say this was 5 stars as I made it. But if an inexperineced chef tries to follow this recipe there would be questions. So Mrs Huffman do make corrections so everyone can enjoy it as much as I did! Thank you!

1925885,504248,2013/8/9,4,"I love making homemade ice cream, and this flavor really piqued my interest!  I followed the instructions exactly, even though I was tempted to add the mashed papaya from the beginning.  The flavor is great - it reminds me of a papaya milk smoothie - on of my favorites here!  But, the ice cream didn&#039;t freeze up completely and was still a bit too loose after freezing for three hours. Next time, I&#039;ll probably use a little less papaya.

179133,501161,2013/6/24,5,"This was really good. I used 7-Up and chocolate mint from my garden (it was that or peppermint and I thought the chocolate mint would go better). I mis-read the directions (wasn&#039;t paying close enough attention) and put all the ice in the glass instead of blending some. Since I was only making one drink, I have some peach mix left so will make the other today, blended with the ice this time! Even though I messed it up slightly it was still good LOL Thanks for sharing and good luck in the contest! ~June 22, 2013 UPDATE: Have to add this was even better made the way it was intended, blended with the ice! :)"

What a lovely treat these cookies are, soft, tender, with beautiful golden raisins and a hint of cinnamon. They were awesome.  I shared them with the neighbors who came back and asked if I had anymore....great praise indeed.  Thank you for sharing your recipe which has gone into my Favorites Cookbook for 2014.

242766,511958,2018/10/2,5,"We really enjoyed these easy, delicious cookies. I thought they were yummy, but I knew the real test was to see what my husband thought of them. Oatmeal raisin cookies are his all-time favorite cookie and when he gave them 2-thumbs up, I knew we had a winner. My first pan out of the oven produced cookies that had spread too much and were very thin. I added a little extra flour to the remaining batter and that did the trick. The rest of the cookies turned out perfect. I got about 3 dozen cookies out of the recipe and a very happy husband. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. **Made for 2018 Football Pool**"

Loved the addition of the potatoes, mushrooms and spinach. I did cook the potatoes for a longer period of time on top of the stove just to be sure they were going to be tender enough.  This makes a great breakfast or brunch dish for sure.  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
610488,503394,2013/7/20,5,"I had a problem with this recipe when I first saw it. To me, one filled bell pepper is not an appetizer but a major side dish or meal then I found a bag at Costco of those small red and orange peppers. Talk about cooking with gas! Filled each one with cheese goop, lined the pan full and away we went. These were such a hit among my last Friday night get together with my friends. Next time, if I had to use regular bell peppers, I might cut them length-wise like little boats, fill them with cheese goop and bake away. I think that might be better as a side dish."

1925885,502447,2013/6/27,0,"This is a wonderful drink - and I enjoyed them often when we first moved to Costa Rica.  However, be forewarned that pineapples coming from Latin America are HEAVILY treated with pesticides, many of which are illegal in the U.S..  So I would question the use of the peel (which is what makes this drink so delicious).  Once I found out the secret ingredient, I don&#039;t drink them anymore.  Latin America, and Costa Rica in particular, have a very high incidence of stomach cancers due to the large consumption of treated fruits and vegetables.  If you&#039;re going to make this, I would suggest using a really potent fruit wash to try to clean as much of the pesticide as possible, or try to find an organic source."
157167,502492,2013/8/4,0,"This sounded delicious, and was nice on a hot summer evening, but the recipe needs several adjustments to turn out.  The recipe will not fit in a 2 quart dish, I had to use my 13&quot;x9&quot; pyrex.  After 14 minutes of cooking, my chicken was still halfway raw - it needs another 5-8 minutes to reach 160*F.  At that point the zucchini and carrots were still underdone, but we ate it anyways :)  The sauce will not thicken unless it comes to a boil, which never happened in the microwave.  Also the juices from the zucchini and chicken added to the pineapple juice so I had to add cornstarch to get a good consistency - I ended up pouring the liquid off after the chicken was done, and simmering it on the stove for a few minutes.  I grabbed a normal 20 oz can of pineapple at the store, and it just had 1 cup of juice, an 8 oz can wouldn&#039;t have had the amount of juice called for.  Because the zucchini and chicken naturally leak juice, the sauce was watered down and could have used more flavor.  It was a quick and easy meal, that didn&#039;t heat up my kitchen, so it was perfect for a busy summer evening.  In the future I will double the sauce ingredients, except the pineapple juice, add another tbsp of cornstarch, and cook it on the stovetop.  For ZWT9."
1268197,500532,2014/3/18,5,I made this for my Sunday School group back in December. I thought I made more than enough but they just kept going back for more! This is a great recipe. The only modification I made was putting the uncooked scrambled eggs in before cooking and refrigerated it overnight so all I had to do was pop it in the oven the next morning.Thanks Sica.

542159,504868,2013/8/11,4,I decided to try this as I had some left over rice and coconut milk and found it to be a very nice dessert.

2002313733,528654,2018/10/27,4,I put 2/3 caramels in a cup and heated it in the microwave until melted. Then I scooped a little bit up with a knife (making it a long strand) and waited for it to cool. I didn't burn my fingers! No matter what I did the nuts would not stick!

37449,501151,2013/6/21,5,A nice tuna salad that was easy to put together. Thanks!
137302,501151,2013/6/21,4,This was very tasty but a bit runny.  Reccomend that you drain the chopped pickles really well and perhaps cut back on the mayo a bit.  After we sampled it so i could review it i added it to 1/2 lb of bow tie pasta cooked ala dente&#039;.  After refrigerating a few hours it was perfect because the pasta absorbed the excess.
226863,501151,2013/6/21,5,"Quick and easy tuna salad.  This was a little &quot;juicy&quot;, but since it was served on romaine instead of on bread, it was fine.  Loved all the crispy vegetables and the hint of lime in this.  Thanks for sharing!"
131126,501151,2013/6/22,4,"This was quick, easy, and I loved the lime zest.  I thought the honey was a nice change too.  I found the mixture too wet, but I did use pickle relish. Next time I would reduce the mayo.  Good luck in the contest!"
80353,501151,2013/6/22,4,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that this tuna salad was just a bit too drippy for comfort, and my kids did have a couple of accidents while eating it.  On the plus side, it is extremely tasty and a good use of contest ingredients.  Good luck, chef."
226867,501151,2013/9/24,5,"I think the liquid-y consistency of this tuna may be due to the fact that what used to be 6 ounce cans are now 5 ounces. That being said, I did use a little less mayo, honey and lime juice than called for and it was much less liquid-y. I only had cut up lettuce and I added some cut up pear tomatoes. I subbed cut up green olives for the celery b/c my DH thinks celery is too crunchy! We liked this a lot! Thanks!"
305531,501151,2013/10/8,5,"Yummy! I read the other reviews about it being a bit wet and cut back on the honey, lime juice and mayo with great results. We enjoyed this for a nice lunch. Thanks westtextazzy for sharing. Made for Football Week 4 2013. Congrats again on another win!"
759658,501151,2014/8/17,0,Did anyone think of adding a 12 oz can of tuna? 6oz isn&#039;t very much and it would be less runny with more tuna.
6994035,503242,2013/9/28,4,"This made a really nice watermelon ice cream. Super easy to make. I made it exactly as directed but It was still a little on the icy side so I had to add more vodka. And it only made two quarts, not a whole gallon. Would definitely make again, thanks for a fun and delicious recipe"
1802693902,503242,2017/8/28,5,"I made this, this past weekend for a large benefit. I was a HUGE success. I made it for the most part exactly as the recipe stated. I tweeted it a bit. I doubled the recipe and used 3 shots is Smirnoff' watermelon vodka. After reading the other reviews and they said the watermelon was on the icey side. I did as the direction stated and then I place the watermelon pulp in a clean towel and twisted and squeezed the moisture out of the pulp and then added to the ice cream mix. It turned out fine and the watermelon perfect. I have another event coming up and plan on making it again for it."
2002208339,503242,2018/7/4,5,"I may or may not sit here w/my soon &amp; finish it all without sharing. I did tweak mine: since I drained the liquid into a pitcher (3c worth), I added more another 2c watermelon (before draining it). And, I didn't want to go to the store so I used some lemon rum instead. Can't taste it, &amp; the alcohol content was similar. It wasn't icy at all."
2382421,534266,2017/12/3,1,"Tried this recipe today, the part where you mix the heavy cream with the chocolate,peppermint extract. Did not harden, had to scrape it off and then add the last layer of chocolate."

I put this on the beef that I was using to make shish kabobs. The funny part is that I had every ingredient (rarely ever happens).

37636,503476,2014/7/23,5,"This is excellent! It reminds me of the toppings for all the usual restaurant fare salads that use blue cheese and some sort of fruit, along with nuts. A person might think that wine is not an appropriate dressing, but there it does depend on the type of wine used. I used a Moscato wine (any sweet white wine would work well) and it blends right in. Doesn&#039;t taste like someone spilled their glass of wine into their salad at all. ;) I served this simply on a leaf of Boston lettuce (for color) Reviewed for the &quot;For your consideration&quot; tag game."

1803048875,517863,2014/8/19,5,Perfect for small informal get togethers

7589172,517863,2014/8/22,5,Mmm!  These are a perfect party bite!
1802517522,517863,2014/8/22,5,The Bacon Babe does it again! :)
1772643,517863,2014/8/23,5,Bacon and Cheese and Beef oh my!!  This looks fabulous!!!
107135,503737,2013/7/15,5,"these smell amazing when you lift the lid of the crockpot, the are going the freezer until after the tour really good recipe zwt 9"
47892,503737,2013/7/17,5,"I also cooked this in the crock pot. I wasn&#039;t thinking though that cooking it in this manner was for us more of an autumn/winter meal. What I wanted to do but didn&#039;t think 2 minutes ahead of myself is to cook the beans with the seasoning in a pan and leave out the broth. I served the soup/stew over cooked collar greens, spoonful of long grain brown rice, and a finish of fresh parsley. So, next time, I&#039;ll skip the broth for a &quot;meal in a bowl&quot; and used the broth alternate method for the colder months. Made for ZWT 9."
2807547,499001,2013/4/30,0,"Made this pie and loved the crust BUT it made way too much for one pie, and, was too crumbly.  I think next time I&#039;ll use one sleeve with the same amount of butter.  A unambiguous measure would perhaps work better than sleeves."
1800297677,499001,2013/11/23,5,"Reserve 1/4 cup of the crumbs to make a ring around the top edge before final bake.  The crust is not sweet, nor is the pie.  Not too tart, not too sweet.  Rather than the sea salt, I opted for lemon/lime zest.  Very easy to make and is my personal favorite."
1802935400,499001,2014/7/17,5,"The pie itself has the consistency of pumpkin pie or cheesecake. After reading reviews, I made the amount of crumbs they asked for in the recipe but opted for a 9 in pie pan instead. It fit perfectly. Taste wise, I found it to be pretty tart but still sweet, which I like. Come to think of it, it tastes like a lemon cheesecake too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was skeptical at first about the crust, but saltines work REALLY well, both taste and texture wise. This pie is amazing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quick baking tip though: the filling doesn&#039;t take that long to make, so if you make it while the crust is cooling in the fridge make sure you wait to add and mix the lemon juice until just before you pour the filling. That way, the milk does not curdle while you wait."
2000262598,499001,2015/6/11,5,"I made this exactly as specified and got rave reviews. It was easy to make, looked impressive on a dessert plate and was delicious. Sweet, tart, salty, with a great texture. I&#039;ll definitely make it again."
2000921244,499001,2016/3/15,5,"Made this for a &quot;Pi day&quot; contest at my boyfriend&#039;s office. Out of 15 pies, it won!

This was one of the easiest desserts i&#039;ve ever made, ever. The recipe definitely didn&#039;t make too much, I used an 8 or 9&quot; pie plate. I used mostly fresh lemon juice, as I only had 2 lemons in my fridge, and used a lime juice squeeze bottle for the rest. My boyfriend was in charge of crumbling the crackers and didn&#039;t make them fine enough, so the crust didn&#039;t really hold together well, so make sure they are crumbs, but not dust (too small), and not shards (too big). I didn&#039;t even get to try any of the pie :-( but everyone loved it! I hope he saved me a piece!"
2001686576,499001,2017/8/25,5,"We've made the pie a few times. We thought the crust was thicker than it needed to be so we cut the saltines to one sleeve with one stick of soft butter and used a 9 inch glass pie pan (some butter was used to butter the pie pan). Additionally, we used lemon juice from fresh lemons. Unique and excellent pie recipe for a fun get together."
1803072847,517863,2014/8/26,5,Delicious! Can&#039;t believe how good these are!
1803074920,517863,2014/8/26,5,These are amazing!!!
2216338,517863,2014/8/27,5,You had me at bacon! I love your polenta twisted up cheese bites.  sw :D
169430,502936,2014/3/23,5,"I made just a single serving for myself and enjoyed every bite. Using 1 fairly large breast and a small oval baking dish with the amounts given for 1 worked very well. I think I might have liked a bit more lemon but that could easily just be my taste as I do love lemon. All in all, very enjoyable with the whole wheat couscous that I have. Made for In The Lands od Figs and Apricots in the North Africa/Middle East forum :D"
1680722,502936,2014/3/26,5,"So easy, healthy and so delicious!&lt;br/&gt;I did not soak the apricots in water as I bough soft dried apricot and I did not use celery as I didn&#039;t have at time. In any case it was so delicious that I did not miss anything and I enjoyed it with fresh bread from the oven. I love chickepeas and for this reason I used the whole big tin I had on hand.&lt;br/&gt;I loved the spices and herbs (fresh cilantro) blend as well as all my family members.&lt;br/&gt;This recipe is a keeper and I will prepare this again."
895132,502936,2015/12/1,5,"Wonderful recipe! I followed the recipe to the letter and we loved it. First I wondered if it would have enough spice, but yes, it does. No need to add anything, it&#039;s perfect. We had this with oven roasted pumpkin wedges.
Thanks for sharing another keeper!"
266635,502936,2017/1/22,5,"Made this tasty chicken dish tonight for dinner. I made just a few changes. I omitted the celery as DH is not a fan, used two cans of chickpeas and I used a whole chicken cut into serving pieces and cooked for a longer period of time. I added a little extra Moroccan spice to the chicken when browning it. Served alongside some rice. : )"
37449,505523,2013/8/20,5,I enjoyed this salad and the dressing was very good! This made a great dinner with some corn. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by a member of team Hot Stuff.
2000431901,528058,2016/9/19,5,"We LOVED this pie! The slab style makes it easy to serve a large group. We had fresh picked honeycrisp apples from a local orchard, and loved the sweet/tart taste of them in the pie. If you prefer a sweeter pie filling you will want to add sugar, but this was just right for us."
2001864249,528058,2018/2/13,5,"I had to go to a funeral. My friend said “We have to pick up a pie for the dinner.” I said, “Your mother deserves better than that! Grieving people deserve real pastry crust! Do you have $14 to spend on bad pie?” I made this slab pie using rectangular foil pack because I won’t get my sheet pan back if I don’t hover at the dessert table, waiting for someone to grab the last piece. It has a plastic lid. I can eat....and GO! I used half new bag honey crisp on sale, half from the apples going soft in the bowl fruit on the table! Worked great!"
2002300022,528058,2018/10/13,0,I like the idea of a sheet cake pie.
498271,499581,2013/5/15,5,Quick and easy comfort food!  I used turkey sausage with great results.  It turns out I was about 2 tablespoons short of rice so I made up the difference with quinoa and that worked out fine.  Served with peas for a yummy comforting meal - thanks for sharing the recipe!
560491,509253,2013/11/26,5,I made this last week for my lunch and it was fantastic!  Only change I made was to use sliced roasted chicken rather than turkey.  I am not a huge turkey fan but love sliced deli chicken.  I made this with the gruyere as suggested and mixed the Dijon with a little mayo.  I think I will try these with leftover turkey after Thanksgiving as well to see which meat I prefer.  Made for Football Pool 2013-14 Win.
309630,509253,2013/12/1,5,Great sandwich! Made with my leftover thanksgiving turkey. Made for week 12 win football pool 2013
266635,509253,2015/11/4,5,What a nice way to jazz up a turkey sandwich.  Loved the flavor interaction with the apricot and dijon.  Left off the lettuce and tomato -- just my preference. Will keep this recipe handy.
242766,509253,2016/1/27,5,"What&#039;s not to love about turkey, bacon, and cheese?  Add in apricot jam and Dijon mustard and you have a real winner.  We loved this sandwich so much!!  I made this as written and it was delicious down to the last bite.  This sandwich will be making an appearance regularly on our lunch menu.  I can&#039;t wait to try it with homegrown tomatoes this summer.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper!  **Made for 2015 Football Pool**"
840768,501688,2014/1/24,5,We really enjoyed this dish.  I amended it for my electronic pressure cooker.  I reduced the chili powder and cumin abit and it was just the right amount of heat for us.  Very tasty recipe and easy to make... a definite keeper.
1802507836,536446,2018/8/17,5,Where do I begin.............delicious!!!! The combination of flavors is beyond words. Try it you won't be disappointed.
592481,516377,2016/12/18,0,"Don't Gnaw on the Pit! I love your cutting ideas! Thanks. I would not recommend giving the pit to kids though. Mango skin contains urushiol, the oil in poison ivy. I have gnawed on the pit before and gotten a low-grade poison ivy rash all over my lips, even though I didn't eat the skin. I feel bad throwing away the pit with all the juicyness I couldn't get to, but I do it every time now to avoid &quot;mango rash.&quot;"

2697289,495577,2013/2/17,5,"Loved it. Even tried it with a bit of pepper jack cheese for a differnt slant on the flavor. Yum! The sharpness of the chedar used can  make a difference, too."

2705729,495577,2013/2/22,4,Very good.   I wonder how they would be with a little diced onion and green pepper?    Did not need all the flour so I was glad I read the recipe for the notation to use just enough to hold it together.   I will be making these again.

1269180,508539,2013/11/9,5,Did this up in the slow cooker while I was at work for the day: super easy and an absolute delight to come home to. Thank you!
695933,508539,2013/11/20,5,"I think chili is one of those things in which we all expect something slightly different. I think that this is a really good recipe, or at least the the base to a really great chili. I made it in a slow cooker/crockpot for the first time yesterday. This is exactly what it pretends to be. A base quick and easy weekday dish. To did this up in the slow cooker the way I like doing chili. This is a simple recipe without a long list of ingredients, but it produces a rich, satisfying chili. Use your imagination! I like my chili mild, so if your ideal of a chili burns your tongue, add red pepper flakes, jalapeno and habanero chilies, and of course, more chili powder. I was waiting to put in the meat because I was planning to use pot roast I had already cooked. I tasted it before adding the meat and it was so delicious I was thinking to kept it like a vegetarian! Wonderfully balanced seasoning. I added three jalepenos and a couple of small red peppers, three stalks of celery and because it was so HOT I added a cup of frozen corn to sweeten it a little. I am going to be Serving it to guests tomorrow! I let it sit overnight and heated it up and served it the next day with cheese on top. I also froze the left overs and it taste even better!! I will definitely be making this easy and healthy recipe again--thank you! I&#039;ll see you in the threads! Happy Cooking Y&#039;all! ...PRMR - 2013 ...Grpa"
212609,508539,2014/3/9,4,"This produced a very nice and simplistic chilli.....with few ingredients and minimum effort.....even my cooking impaired DH could knock this one up without breaking into a sweat, and we could actually eat it !!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
2324285,496018,2013/4/1,5,"Whoa...  this is really good.  I thought that amount of curry powder was way too much, but nope, it was just right.  I had to use ghee instead of coconut oil, and threw in two chopped serrano chilis with the onions.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  The lentil mixture was so full of flavor that I think even the most hardcore carnivore wouldn&#039;t miss the meat! [Made &amp; Reviewed for PAC Fall 2013]"

Really enjoyed this,  made for Cooking Mania Tag game"
226863,518415,2014/10/26,5,"Beautiful color contrast with the tomatoes, parsley and fish!  Loved the ease of the prep in this dish.  Made with roasted potatoes and spinach souffle, so everything was done in the oven.  Perfection!  Delicious flavor with no guilt!  I used greek seasoning instead of seasoning salt, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!"
169430,518415,2015/3/8,5,"Delicious and super simple. I used Northern Pickerel and only needed 1 filet to easily feed the two of us. The tomato and onion bed was a new way for me to do fish and it was really tasty. Pickerel is a very bland fish so I used a homemade salt mix made with black Salish smoked salt and a few other stronger flavored things. The outcome was something special. Served with lemon and rosemary rice, honeyed carrots and a small green salad. Dinner was quick an easy banquet. Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe."

I took Breezer&#039;s advice and added 1/4 teaspoon salt, and because I thought the wings would be bland for me, I added 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  I had sauce left over after basting several times, yet the wings were swimming ~ I believe the sauce ingredients could be cut back some and maybe the wings would crisp up better ~ or next time I&#039;ll perhaps up the heat to 375F toward the end of roasting!"
163112,523032,2015/8/23,5,"I cut this way back for just 2 people.  My daughter, The Picky One, who doesn&#039;t like kale, said it&#039;s the best kale she&#039;s ever had.  So, there ya have it!  Made for CQ &#039;15, Munching Minions."

437598,515852,2014/5/6,4,"My daughter and I really enjoyed this. I had 6 leftover tortillas in the fridge and this was the perfect recipe to use them. I didn&#039;t have a 12 in. cast iron skillet, so I used my 12 in. nonstick skillet and it worked well. We like Mexican and this was easier than rolling the enchiladas., Thanks for a good recipe. Next time I will serve it with additional taco sauce at the table."
852554,495098,2013/4/3,5,This tasted like a treat for low carb - have to burn off those chocolate bunnies!  Thanks!  Made for PAC Spring &#039;13
2000176787,495098,2015/4/30,5,WOW!!!  Delicious!!! I was worried about the calories..but I think this one muffin was enough for two servings!!!  Great with a spritz of lite whipped topping?!  YUMMY!!!
480195,504504,2013/8/24,5,"This made a great dessert. I used greek yogurt and used very ripe figs from my tree. I skipped the watercress, but I did sprinkle with mint. I skipped the oilive oil. We loved the flavor and I will make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
1783373,508954,2014/1/12,3,"I love beer bread and love pumpkin too, so when I made this bread it was exciting.  It was very easy to make, but it took longer to cook than the recipe suggested and it deflated.  I checked the ingredients and temp of oven in case I may have done something incorrectly. Everything was correct so not exactly sure why it didn&#039;t work out.  Maybe there is an ingredient missing?  Would go well with a pumpkin or sweet potato soup.  Thx. Debbwl for posting."
2549237,508954,2014/5/9,4,"I really love pumpkin bread and liked the beer bread that I have tried so this recipe was great.  I liked the texture of the bread, but mine also deflated.  It wasn&#039;t as sweet as the normal pumpkin breads, but it went well with your recipe for Buffalo Cauliflower Chili.  I&#039;m not really sure what happened with the bread deflating, but it still tasted good, so I didn&#039;t mind.  Thanks for another great recipe Debbwl.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
107583,507423,2014/5/8,5,Great muffins.  I subbed raspberries for the blueberries and skipped the granola topping.  Will be making these again.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC.
2000757320,516546,2015/12/20,5,"I am currently and expat living in China. This recipe gives such a great taste of home! Thank you! I have added some flavors (Garlic, Dill) to fit different types of meals. I also don&#039;t have access to cheap butter, so I found that oil can be substituted."
1803019253,508960,2014/8/11,0,"I think the recipe calls for &quot;50%&quot; lamb, not &quot;50$&quot; lamb. Try using 50% sour cream instead of all plain yogurt, which tends to be more sour and runny, use dill along with the mint, and I add a splash of raspberry vinegar along with the usual white vinegar for an unusual taste and a little sweetness without adding sugar."

146742,514390,2017/4/14,5,"I make this all the time when I need a can of condensed soup. It's so handy. Be sure the tomato paste is hfc free. Some of the cans of tomato paste in my pantry did list hfc in the ingredients, so I have gotten rid of those."
2001297534,521748,2018/2/28,5,I made this recipe as written. The recipe was easy to follow. I served it on a bed of spaghetti. The sauce had a lot of flavor and was one of the best pasta sauce recipes I have found in a long time. Thanks for sharing..
2662969,494799,2013/2/8,5,Like the idea of the pretzels on the chicken.
2667703,494799,2013/2/8,5,Tried this recipe and my family really enjoyed it.
2667767,494799,2013/2/9,5,I love the pretzel crust idea!
654393,494799,2013/2/9,5,Pretzel Crusted Chicken... how clever! Sound unique!
2685334,494799,2013/2/10,5,Awesome! The kids absolutely loved the idea of having pretzels on their chicken! I will definitely make this recipe again!
2423668,494799,2013/2/20,5,What a fantastic idea! YUM!
136997,495812,2013/3/2,5,"I liked the sound of this recipe, but not that it had frozen/canned vegetables in it. I chose to use fresh and adjusted the cooking times accordingly. :)"
220195,505862,2013/8/24,0,"No, 500 degrees is not a typo, as several people have asked in the Q &amp; A forum. See original recipe at http://www.quickneasyrecipes.net/loaded-baked-potato-chicken-casserole/"
1800510544,505862,2013/12/7,5,"Tried it for dinner tonight, and found myself eating the potatoes before I added the chicken. Great recipe and definitely a meal I will continue to make. It&#039;s also great with salad."
1800639424,505862,2013/12/11,0,"I don&#039;t eat bacon, so i sauted some turkey ham, turned out great"
44812325,505862,2013/12/22,5,Absolutely wonderful meal will definitely make again and again..........
1801816904,505862,2014/1/3,5,"This recipe is awesome, so easy to make and such a hit with my family"
2766748,505862,2014/1/17,1,"Should&#039;ve mentioned the spicy/heat between the pepper &amp; hot sauce, totally overbearing that it&#039;s not enjoyable... Not really good at all."
1800199313,505862,2014/2/23,0,"Loved this recipe, so good! Easy to make. Goes good with broccoli and cheese!"
136997,505862,2014/3/5,5,My husband declared this to be a keeper. I omitted the hot sauce. I can&#039;t handle heat at all.
1764844,505862,2014/3/11,0,I made this for the second time tonight. I love the &quot;kick&quot; the potatoes have. I don&#039;t add the cheese mixture until the last 3 minutes so the bacon doesn&#039;t get overcooked. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
126440,505862,2014/3/14,5,Loved how easy and filling this recipe is.  Had been cleaning carpets so was great for an easy  supper.  Made this for four with three potatoes and DH finished it off.
1802628038,505862,2014/3/29,5,Added ranch dressing dry mix to chicken and cut the hot sauce to 2 tbsp after the first time I made this. Way to hot otherwise! Really good!
1802694358,505862,2014/4/24,5,My wife made this last night!! Easily climbed to the top of my favorite dinners. Highly recommend it to anyone.
1802736864,505862,2014/5/12,0,Family and guests loved this. Very easy to make
1802759294,505862,2014/5/22,5,I made this last night. I cut the hot sauce in half and added ranch dressing. My kids loved this. It kept the hot sauce flavor without being to hot for the kids.
1802764208,505862,2014/5/24,5,"Oh my gosh! My first review on food ever!!! I&#039;m the type that does not look at recipes for dinner, mostly because i very rarely have every ingredients that the recipe asks for. One day I had wondered about a loaded bake potatoe and how amazing it would be I Googled this and this recipe had the best reviews of all. Of course, I did not have chedder cheese. I have American cheese. I did not have the right size of pan...I have a 9x9. Of course I did not have olive oil I had conola oil. Lastly I had only 1 lb of chicken. But hey. I had to make it work. Same recipe but minor substations ;) It came out great!!!!! The top burnt a little but I&#039;m so glad. It was a fantastic dinner for my husband and baby girl. Thank you for posting this. I just wanted to let everyone know, it was amazing that you can make this without the exact ingredients! The marinating part was to die for! And I do not agree with the person that said it asked for too much hot sauce. I used tapatio :) and added more ;)"
9653688,505862,2014/7/6,1,Followed exact recipe and really thought this was gonna be good but this just was to bland. I don&#039;t see how this recipe has been rated so highly even my hubby said it was awful....
1802984835,505862,2014/8/1,5,"Excellent recipe! I found it extremely spicy the first time, so the second time I topped it with some sour cream....delicious!"
2736366,505862,2014/8/6,0,"Can this be made ahead of time? Example, in the morning for Dinner later."
1803390542,505862,2014/11/23,0,Great Recipe
1803451044,505862,2014/12/3,5,I love trying new things so I made this for dinner tonight. I&#039;m not one for hot stuff so I did half the hot sauce and added a pinch of sugar. Absolutely delicious with sour cream on top. Would recommend this to anyone willing to try something new!
11476617,505862,2015/1/2,4,"I did not have green onion, so I added onion powder. It was still good, but lacked something. I think the green onion would have added another layer of flavor. I was also thinking that since this is supposed to be &quot;Loaded&quot;, that sour cream would have been good. I will do that next time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was afraid that the chicken would not get done in just 15 minutes, so I cooked it in the skillet while the potatoes were cooking. Cooking in the skillet gives chicken a nice browned flavor that could not be achieved in the oven under the toppings anyway, so I will keep that in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;500 degrees was good, but I found the cooking time a little too long so several of the potatoes burned. temps vary among ovens though, so its hard to say on that one. I will do 475 next time."
1803598845,505862,2015/1/2,5,My family loved this recipe!  I followed others&#039; reviews and lessened the hot sauce to just 2 Tablespoons since we don&#039;t like things too spicy.  I also used just 1 teaspoon of pepper and 1 teaspoon of Paprika.  I added about 1/4 cup of Ranch dressing to make up for the hot sauce I left out.  We ate it with sour cream.  It was delicious and I plan to make it again!
1803615576,505862,2015/1/5,4,"I modified this to suit my family&#039;s taste. I eliminated the hot sauce and replaced it with equal amount of water. The meal still had plenty of zip and I may even cut back on the garlic powder next time. 500 is very hot. The potatoes were done in only 30 mins, the chicken cooked in 10 mins. I added the toppings after the chicken was done, turned off the oven and let it sit in the oven for just a few mins until the cheese melted (I used precooked bacon). The meal made plenty for a second meal, which was a bonus. I&#039;ll make this again with slight modifications to oven temp and ingredient amounts."
1802849661,505862,2015/1/8,3,"Cooked as per instructions and the potatoes were tender and the chicken cooked through. I love loaded potatoes and this had all the flavours I love. It was a bit too spicy for my liking, but my partner loved it, so that&#039;s just personal preference. I probably would reduce the temp next time. Even though it isn&#039;t a typo, I prefer things cooked longer and lower."
897278,505862,2015/2/2,3,cooked in a gas stove this recipe was quite dry and the chicken was still raw.  Had to cook for 15 additional minutes.  Flavour was good though. Not sure if altitude had any affect on the results.
2000020607,505862,2015/2/24,0,"Not sure why - my oven said it was at 500 degrees, and it cooked the potatoes well - but the chicken was raw after 25 minutes!  Really?  Of course that means the cheese and bacon got overcooked.  Bummer!  This recipe seemed to have such great reviews."
2000064639,505862,2015/3/15,3,"I would really give this 3 1/2 if I could.

I knocked off points for the recipe not being very clear. 
I used small red potatoes and 8 worked fine. I&#039;m not sure what kind of potatoes were intended but 8 &quot;baking potatoes&quot; plus everything else wouldn&#039;t fit into any pan I have.
I halved the sauce which I assume is what the recipe intended, but it wasn&#039;t very clear. It worked fine. You just need to coat everything. 
I know a lot of people are complaining about it being too spicy, but that varies greatly on your taste buds and the hot sauce you use. My husband and I liked it with tapatio, but our youngsters didn&#039;t so I will use less next time. I also followed the lead of others and added an envelope of ranch mix which was really good. I don&#039;t think I would make it without it because it helps with the spice and gives it good flavor. I think without it all you would taste is spicy flavors.

It will be made again, but with a few adjustments. Overall good though."
2000068918,505862,2015/3/17,4,"This was great, but we agreed that next time we&#039;ll take out the chicken and make it as a side dish instead of a main course. It was like eating a fully loaded baked potato! I&#039;ll cut it in half and use an 8&quot;x8&quot;, but leftovers heated up nicely, too."
2000084014,505862,2015/3/23,5,"I would knock off 1/4 of a star, just because there wasn&#039;t enough marinade for 8 potatoes and 2lbs of chicken, and I had to split everything up into two pans.  Other than that this was great!  I did reduce the amount of pepper to 1tsp and used white pepper instead of black, just because sometimes it makes me cough.  I felt the amount of heat was perfect. My husband thought it was a tad too spicy.  I did also pour my leftover bacon grease over the chicken (half breast, half thigh) before baking, and the chicken didn&#039;t dry out at all.  We served it up with sour cream and raw sliced green onions for a little freshness.  It&#039;ll definitely be in the recipe rotation, we both enjoyed it!  Next time I may swap the hot sauce for some tangy BBQ sauce for a change of pace, and also rub my pans down with oil or butter because the potatoes stuck and my pan edges got black :("
2000184762,505862,2015/5/4,5,"I made this for my husband and I and he almost ate the whole pan to himself,he couldn&#039;t stop! The only thing I changed was I used Siracha instead (but only half the amount, I&#039;m not insane) and no green onions, and it was Fantastic! The only thing is, I&#039;d partly cook the bacon before adding, or you&#039;ll end up with A LOT of grease in the pan.
I&#039;m making this again tonight, but instead of hot sauce (we have kids tonight, and they do not handle heat well, at all) I&#039;m using ranch to make it a bacon ranch chicken casserole, the whole family is seriously looking forward to supper tonight."
2000184908,505862,2015/5/4,4,"Very good recipe, but I had to make a few adjustments. First I doubled the oil to 2/3 cup to have enough for both potatoes and chicken. I sauted my chicken in the bacon grease for about 5-7 minutes so they would be done when cooked in the oven. 15 minutes isn&#039;t long enough for the chicken to be well done. And lastley I added the green onions after cooking to add a fresh element. After these few minor changes this recipe was very delicious and a big hit. Definitely will make again."
2000188896,505862,2015/5/6,5,"Awesome! I made it the first time like the directions said and some of the potatoes burnt (I have a strong oven though) tonight I decided to make it again but in the crockpot! I just mixed the &quot;sauce&quot; and put in the potatoes like it said, added those to the bottom of the crockpot, added a bit of olive oil to the remaining sauce, mixed in the chicken, and layer it on top of the potatoes. Set on low for a few hours and high for the last 1-2 hours. Delish!! Oh, and we didn&#039;t use hot sauce, due to the little one :) Love this!"
2000321419,505862,2015/7/7,0,This was so good! I used only a few tablespoons of Tabasco and 1/4 a cup of so of ranch dressing. The potatoes were done after 45 minutes and the chicken took about another 15. So tasty! I only used about 4 large potatoes and had to make extra marinade for the chicken.
2000322650,505862,2015/7/7,4,It would have been very tasty if the potatoes hadn&#039;t burned. 500 degrees is not necessary. I didn&#039;t even bake it the full 45 minutes. The oven was so hot that I shut it off before I added the chicken and toppings and they still were done in 9 minutes. I&#039;ll make this again but I&#039;ll be baking it at 375.
2000323376,505862,2015/7/7,5,"Easy recipe. I cubed and cooked the chicken while my potatoes were baking. (I like to cook my meat before adding it to other things) I mean what can go wrong with potatoes, chicken, bacon and cheese??"
2000350673,505862,2015/7/20,5,Wow this recipe was extra easy and quick me and my family did a 3 mile walk while the cooking went on
2000400200,505862,2015/8/12,4,it was tasty but the texture was too dry...i ended up using ranch as a dipping sauce on the side and my husband used it as well as hot sauce. i thought about a little sour cream but i didnt have any..overall it was good though..thanks!
2000437304,505862,2015/8/29,5,The family loved it. We do not eat pork so I used turkey bacon and a Colby Jack blend cheese....I forgot the hot sauce but added a salt free seasoning mix close to Mrs. Dash....yum
2000461431,505862,2015/9/8,5,"I never review on recipes but this one was DELICIOUS. I used baby reds 16, Chula for my hot sauce and used an 8x13 pan. It was so easy and my other half loved it definitely printing and keeping for another nite. Thank you for sharing"
2000695005,505862,2015/11/19,5,Turned out great..thanks!
2366044,505862,2016/2/4,5,"My son and husband really liked this dish and even ate it two days in a row, which for my son that&#039;s unusual.  I did throw in broccoli because I like broccoli in baked potatoes and they didn&#039;t even pick them out like I thought they would.  Added bonus!  I also reduced the recipe in half (but not the marinade) and cooked it on low in the crockpot.  I figured the potatoes would need longer, so I put them in an hour before the chicken, then added the chicken and half the cheese and ran an errand for a few hours.  When I came home it was finished, so I put more cheese and the bacon on top."
2000781313,505862,2016/2/8,4,"Everyone loved it! The recipe could be written much more clearly. For instance, 8 potatoes, but what size? I ended up using 7 medium sized idahos. Probably could have used 6 instead. Also, i cooked potatoes at 450 not 500 and it was fine. I made the bacon in the microwave and then just browned chicken in a pan w olive oil, instead of in the bacon fat. The recipe made 2 9x2 &quot; pans. I followed the spices to a t and it was not too hot at all. perfectly spiced! Got several requests for the recipe!"
2000885562,505862,2016/2/21,5,Excellent recipe!!  I followed it as written except I lowered oven to 450.  Potatoes were crispy and delicious.  My daughter told me that I could make this every week!
415280,505862,2016/2/28,5,"Family pleaser, one dish easy! 

I used a bag of mixed color small potatoes from Trader Joe&#039;s, and two medium baking potatoes. Used kitchen shears to cut the chicken into small pieces the size of the potatoes. Mixed it all up &amp; placed into a 9x11 Pyrex lined with heavy foil. Followed the recipe to a &quot;T,&quot; except I just used the potatoes I had on hand. 

Of course, you can gauge the level of heat by the amount of hot sauce. We&#039;re wimpy on spice/heat level, so I only used one tablespoon of Texas Pete. Great meal! 

TIP: toss your mixture really well to insure all of the seasonings get distributed evenly, AND reduce the temp to 450."
2000915490,505862,2016/3/12,5,"So good!! We devour it every time I make it.  I usually add fresh organic parsley along with the bacon crumbles and green onion and it elevates the dish.  Also, I used red potatoes @450&deg; and it wasn&#039;t burnt."
429976,505862,2016/5/21,5,"Yum!! We all loved it. I doubled and used only 3 T of Cholula hot sauce. Also, I just set the oven as I normally would - 375 and it worked out great, but the potatoes were leftover, so precooked."
2001032067,505862,2016/5/30,5,I've made this several times now and have decreased the amount of oil each time since 1/3 of a cup made this dish extremely greasy and 1/4 of a cup is still too much in my opinion. I also omitted the bacon since I do not eat bacon and used shredded Mexican blend cheese. Delicious and so easy to make!!!
1483931,505862,2016/8/25,3,"I'd give this more stars if the directions were more clear and accurate. I agree that 500&deg; is unnecessary. There are no specifications on what kind of potatoes, how many ounces or slices of bacon, what size dish to use... And as far as the prep time...kudos to anyone who can peel and cube 8 potatoes, 2 lbs of chicken, shred cheese, and cut up green onions in 10 minutes. All of that being said, the recipe itself is yummy. Since I had no idea what kind of potatoes to use, I just used a mix of red and gold. I cut up 8 slices of bacon and then browned them...that ended up being just a teensy bit shy of one cup so I'd say do 9 slices...unless you have thick cut then 8 should be ok. I agree also that more oil could be used. I pretty much cooked my chicken all the way while I was waiting for the potatoes to bake and then just did the chicken, bacon, cheese, and onions all together and put it back in for 3 minutes. I used an 8x11.5&quot; dish and it all fit but just barely! If you only have and 8x8/9x9 or a 9x13, use the 9x13! I had left out the hot sauce as my daughter won't eat spicy and then the rest of us put Frank's red sauce on ours (and a little bit of sour cream) and it was delicious!"
2001220648,505862,2016/10/25,2,"Um, not a fan of this recipe. I agree 500&deg; is definitely too hot (Gass Oven). My potatoes were a little on the crisper/darker side after the 2nd, 15 minutes. I like the concept being that Bacon, Potatoes, Chicken and Cheese are some of my favorite things. But I feel the paprika was OVER powering the whole meal. I tried to use ranch dressing to soften the taste, but it still was very rough on my pallet."
2001258133,505862,2016/11/21,5,I rock this recipe everytime. I use Chipotle Tabasco which is amazing instead of regular hot sauce. While the potatos are cooking (I use my dicer to dice the potatos) I cube the raw chicken up to the same size of my potatos I diced. You want them small to cook fast. I do not cook regular bacon - I use the ready bacon. I throw that in the microwave and that only takes 1 minute instead of all the time to fry a bunch. I dice up the bacon. After I pull the potatoes out I layer everything on top. Then add the cheese and green onions. Oh I use colby jack or casserole cheese btw. I reserve a few green onions for after and I put it in the oven for another 15-20 minutes at 350. The chicken is always cooked. Then we drizzle ranch over the top! Yummy!
2001365042,505862,2017/1/24,5,i cooked the chicken and potatoes separate and then mixed together and cooked with toppings came out awesome
2001387812,505862,2017/2/11,5,"I wondered about the 500 degrees too, but stirred the potatoes every 15 min as instructed. I did however add a tablespoon of oil the last 15 min as they were getting a bit dry. This turned out AMAZING and my family loves it! I will be making it again and again! Thank you??"
2001362871,505862,2017/3/16,5,"I always do 4 cans of potatoes at 500* for 15 mins., then 4 cans of chopped chicken over the potatoes for 12 mins. At 425*. I mix the toppings in a bowl and top the mixture. Cook 5 mins. Then done. Oh, and I add more olive oil, and only 10 dashes of tobacco.....yummy."
2001451132,505862,2017/3/23,5,Loved it!!!
2001068100,505862,2017/5/3,5,My family loved it and these are some picky people. They even gobbled up the left overs the next morning.
2001520270,505862,2017/5/3,5,"I also made this dish, with a couple tweak's. First instead of fresh potatoes I used a bag of frozen seasoned potato wedges, at 400&deg; and baked my bacon while the potatoes cooked per package. Since my potatoes were already seasoned I didn't use the sauce on them, instead I got them crispy. I used what I had on hand which was four chicken breast cut in cubes cooked in the bacon grease and then tossed in the seasoning sauce with 1/2 package? of ranch, I left out the salt. I also steamed fresh broccoli and tossed it in the remaining sauce. Then I layered the broccoli on top of the potatoes, the chicken on top of the broccoli, shredded eight ounces of Monterey Jack cheese with jalapenos on top of that and the bacon. I didn't have green onions but I cut up a sweet onion and added on top the raw onions. Sour cream would have been nice but I didn't have any so a little ranch sufficed?. Super Yummy"
2001755155,505862,2017/10/16,4,"Was VERY GOOD.......cooked my at 425 for 45 min., then added chicken &amp; cheese.....cooked an additional 12 min."
2001836906,505862,2017/12/4,5,So delicious!!!
2001893181,505862,2017/12/27,3,"Lots of changes need to be made to make this recipe work. Oven should be set to 400F, way too salty....I changed to 1 tsp and still too salty, omit salt. Bacon is salty, cheese has salt, etc. Reduce amount of paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper. The first time there was so much heat all you could taste was pepper. I reduced to 2 tsps, same with paprika and garlic. Also much more interesting with different cheese, try brie, camembert, good recipe base but needs enhancements. I submitted corrections hopefully they will post. Happy holidays!"
2001924474,505862,2018/1/11,5,I set the oven to 400 instead of 500 degrees. Came out perfect Very very tasty. But you better like spicy
2002037088,505862,2018/3/8,4,"I made a few changes. I used smoked paprika and added green chile to add some spice. I also doubled the sauce and blended it in my vitamix. To speed up the time, I broiled the potatoes on 450-500 and watched them closely. It tastes like a baked potato!"
2002070360,505862,2018/3/23,3,Bake at 500 if you want to set your house on fire. Otherwise set at 375 and it will turn out perfect. No clue what maniac wrote this at 500 and thought it was ok.
2002155060,505862,2018/5/17,5,"I did this as a use for leftover, fully cooked chicken breast and parboiled potatoes. Agreed, this 500 degrees business would have been way too hot, but 375 was just right. It took maybe 25 mins even time total! Very tasty. We think it is a great heavy hors doervre owing to the richness, but not really an entree."
2002236741,505862,2018/8/1,5,i've made this a few times now and every time has turned out perfect! I was a little sceptical of the 500 degrees but i figured thats what the recipe says so ill try it out and just keep a close eye on it. Its worked perfectly every time! As long as you follow the directions and stir every 15 minutes theres nothing to worry about
2002240647,505862,2018/8/6,5,"Our family does not like hot sauce so instead I added cream of chicken, about half a can. It tasted so good and no green onions. Remember to keep mixing potatoes until done and I think they were done before 45 min."
2002358411,505862,2018/12/7,2,I think this recipe is a great foundation. It provides you with a direction but you better know what you're doing in the kitchen if you want to use this recipe. We substituted ham for the chicken as that's what we had in the fridge and treated the seasonings as a &quot;ranch packet&quot; (added dried parsley and dill). I cut the salt in half as the ham and cheese had oodles of salt (but the potatoes did soak some up) and using monterey jack cheese is a must to get that creaminess!
2000498330,512873,2017/7/31,5,"This was a delicious, hearty, chunky, full-of flavor dip. I cooked the ground beef on stovetop. Served with crispy tortilla chips. Love"
88099,506360,2013/9/7,4,I loved the dried cranberries added in with the bacon.  Great flavors.  I think boiling the broccoli made my dressing a little watery even after draining it very well on paper towels.  I think next time I&#039;ll omit the boiling step.  I personally like the raw broccoli best.  But I will absolutely made this one again.  Thank you for sharing.  Made for New Kids on the Block
2002292250,536474,2018/10/21,4,It was fantastic! We'll definitely make it again.
107135,502419,2013/8/17,5,this is heartier  than the other soup by the same name. i really like the combo of asparagus  and crab.zwt9
2001766738,520132,2017/10/26,0,love wassail - i buy the mix - it has annatto in it - how much would i put in ?
1802940935,516946,2014/7/21,5,"Wow, so flavourful. Love them."
1278514,492771,2014/11/23,3,"My boyfriend absolutely loves the Sin-dawg from Dave&#039;s killer bread, but they&#039;re very hard to find where we live. I gave this recipe a whirl with no alterations and I have to say the flavor and texture are pretty close. However, the recipe says to not seal the dawgs and I would highly suggest that you do. I didn&#039;t and most of the filling oozed out leaving me with some sadly empty dawgs. Also, even though I used a jelly roll pan with edges, enough filling leaked out that it overflowed onto the bottom of my oven. Sad-face for now needing to clean burned sugar mess out of my oven. I will definitely try this again, with sealed edges, and if it works out, I&#039;ll update my star rating."
1802841750,492771,2016/1/5,5,Wonderful..thank yu for sharing
135566,509443,2014/5/5,5,"I did not have ranch dressing mix, so added onion powder, garlic powder and dried parsley flakes to the dry mixture.  Really enjoyed this chicken.  I do plan to make it again using the ranch, and also want to try it using other dry dressing mixes for flavor changes. I&#039;m also going to use the coating to make chicken tenders, which only take 20 minutes to bake and would be a quick meal.  Made for Spring 2014 Pick A Chef."
37449,508241,2013/11/7,5,"I really enjoyed this dish!I did make a few changes, using spiral pasta,soy milk, and basil cream cheese. I didn&#039;t have zuchhini, so used red bell peppers, onions, and peas(and had to use dried tarragon). Loved the sauce and it was so good with the salmon. Thanks!"
2002194586,492771,2018/6/22,0,"So glad to have a SinDawg recipe. Making your own at home will be the only way to enjoy this delicious, healthy cinnamon roll."
593927,498581,2013/4/14,5,"Great!!! I knew I would love the tahini sauce because I use it for other salads we enjoy, specifically recipe#149565 and a variation without cucumber and with chickpeas. I used organic green kale, an organic braeburn apple, organic Thompson raisins in place of Craisins for no sugar added, Pakistani pine nuts (real pine nuts) in place of the walnuts which I toasted in a dry pan, greater amount of organic carrot grated, no celery, no beans as I had chikpeas but didn&#039;t think they would match too well, tried to buy sprouts but wasn&#039;t sure of the kind so I had to leave them out this time, organic tahini, organic freshly squeezed lemon juice, sea salt to taste, organic raw, local honey, plus the water. I want to try this on DH along with a soup."
358513,498581,2013/4/18,5,I had to try this after (Chef #593927) UmmBinat recommended. I used all Organic. I did only add carrots and apples but the sweetness from the apple worked nicely with the raw kale. I also used a little organic apple cider vinegar mixed in the Tahini and a couple drops of spicy sesame oil for a little kick. Next time I will try it with the honey.
227831,498581,2014/6/10,5,"While I am primarily rating the dressing here, this was simply excellent.  Sharon 123 has a great eye for flavors and textures and this salad is a prime example.  This dressing is just one of those recipes where the flavor pops.  I used kale cut fine and I added the apple I had into the mix.  I also used toasted walnuts.  Didn&#039;t have sprouts or edamame.  And I threw in some feta cheese.  But the salad dressing makes this.  If you&#039;ve been wanting to try a kale salad, this is a great salad dressing for kale and for what ever veggies you might have on hand.  However, the apple, the nuts make for a winner on texture and flavor contrasts and so those are pretty important components."
1803561643,498581,2014/12/25,5,"Excellent salad!  It&#039;s quick and easy to make. If you have to reduce the salt in your diet, cut the salt in half and it&#039;s still fabulous.   I&#039;m going to make more of the dressing to use on other salads as well!"
1801476385,498581,2015/10/26,1,I really wanted this to be delicious.  It wasn&#039;t.  I followed the recipe to a T. I wish I could be more positive but I threw out my salad and I never throw away salad.
2001672505,498581,2017/8/15,5,"I just printed the recipe so I will have it in my kitchen. I will definitely make it again. Both the salad and the dressing were fantastic! It was fresh, crunchy, and a great main dish salad."
128473,513348,2014/2/23,5,"Thank you for sharing your beautiful recipe ForeverMama.  It reminds me of a cake that my grandmother and mother use to make.  Thank you for the lovely memories.My dh was over the moon, about this cake.  We usually share cakes that I make with the neighbors but this time, he said no sharing...he wanted it all, but he had to share with me.  I made this cake as written but left out the nuts due to dh&#039;s allergy.  This recipe, makes a delicious, moist, tender cake, with a perfect crumb, that is big on flavor. The Broiler Topping is most definitely the icing on this cake.  Tastes like a cross between fudge and caramel with coconut.  I can imagine how great it is with the nuts.  Make this treat, you will not be disappointed. Made for Photo Tag."
1925885,498286,2018/8/13,3,"These cupcakes were tasty, but the flavor was a bit odd. Maybe too much beets (it was difficult to figure half the can). Even though I used the Hershey's Dark cocoa powder, there was an overpowering flavor that was not chocolate. The frosting was good, especially since I used more of the raspberries to get more flavor and I left the seeds in for texture!"
2000431901,497992,2016/3/12,0,"I had to make this twice. The first time I used a round cake pan because the recipe didn&#039;t specify the type of pan, and it was way too short. Glad I had a baking sheet under it! The second time I used a round casserole dish and that worked better. I used Bob&#039;s Red Mill gluten free flour mix. It was pretty crumbly, but tasted good. If I made it again I&#039;d try mixing the raisins in the dry ingredients instead of the wet to see if it kept them from sinking to the bottom."
1175362,497992,2017/3/20,5,"Amazing! My 4-year-old granddaughter helped me bake this as a surprise for her gluten-free father. I was dubious of how it would turn out (so I baked the regular one as an option for the rest of us!). But it turned fabulous - it had a more delicate, cake-like crumb but I felt it was a real success! I will be happy to tuck this recipe away for any time I have gluten-free needs at my table. ** I halved the recipe and put it in an 8-inch cake pan and it fit perfectly.) Thanks so much!"
2002043461,497992,2018/3/11,5,Hands down the best Irish soda bread I’ve ever made. I used Bobs red mill 1:1 baking flour. Moist and delicious!
2001575264,497992,2018/3/11,0,I will try this with coconut flour . It looks pretty good.
2711815,495175,2013/2/25,0,Looks good!
2000603847,517155,2015/10/25,5,"I had the pleasure of enjoying one of these divine cinnamon rolls at a recent family brunch and it was AMAZING!!!! So grateful he was willing to share the recipe. They sound a little labor intensive however, knowing how wonderful they are, the are worth the effort. I only hope I can replicate their absolute deliciousness!"
2000606020,517155,2015/10/25,5,"So when he says these remind him of those from the chain restaurants in the mall, that&#039;s no lie! These cinnamon rolls are amazing, forget about your diet, do your best Paula Dean impersonation and pile up a stick of butter next to one of these glorious confections, and put on your fat pants because you&#039;re not going to want to stop at one. This is the type of recipe that will make you a breakfast (or dessert) hero to your family, or even your office if you&#039;re trying to score some points."
1418189,517155,2017/1/28,5,"These were fabulous! A little work, but no good cinnamon roll is without work! I cheated and bought store bought cream cheese icing, but it didn't change the taste one bit! I saw where the recipe was going with the icing, and just chose to be lazy. Excellent recipe, I will be making again!"
93446,498060,2013/3/29,5,"This recipe was in a free cookbook I got with my new Chatelaine subscription and it looked so good, I had to try it.  My grocer had sea scallops on special last week so I bought what I needed and froze them to use later in the week.  We had them today for Good Friday.  I only used five bok choy since they were quite large but it was more than enough.  We really enjoyed this - DD asked for seconds, which he rarely does, unless it&#039;s dessert. :-)  I will definitely make this dish again!"
2694963,494334,2013/2/15,0,"great recipe, had a chance to try it the other nigh at the kitchen of the chef"
2701435,494334,2013/2/19,5,These were fantastic.  They are so easy and VERY tasty.  They are even better the next day.  I would love to see more recipes from this chef.
2702188,494334,2013/2/19,5,These were so delicious. Easy to make Great for a party. .
2705202,494334,2013/2/22,1,"Very yummy, I liked how it was quick and easy to make but tastes like I had been cooking for a long time. Flavors are even better the next day! Two thumbs up!"
13796,494334,2013/2/23,5,Oooh.. these turned out very good! I used pork sausage (sweet breakfast and hot). I wouldn't have used the baby spinach leftovers for anything so I just used the whole bag. I think it would be good with even more spinach. I'll cut back a little on the Hidden Valley seasoning as it was a little salty for me and I'm a salt lover. They baked up beautifully browned and there was no leakage of filling. Next time I'll try making 6 instead of 4 because these things are too big for one serving. Loved it though!
2710341,494334,2013/2/24,5,Very good tasting recipe and relatively easy to make.  Very impressed.  Will make this again soon.
452355,498060,2013/8/28,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe last night for dinner.  It is the perfect weeknight meal because the prep is so minimal and it comes together quickly and easily.  It is also really impressive looking.  I used sea scallops.  I loved the combination of the sweet chili sauce and the bok choy.  In fact I think I enjoyed my chili bok choy bites more than my scallop bites and this could easily be made a good vegetarian dish.  Also, I didn&#039;t start my rice in time, so I served over vermicelli rice noodles instead.  Thanks for posting.  Made for Family Picks ZWT9."

695933,507045,2013/9/28,4,"I?m so glad to see this. These are the exact cookies i?ll be baking on sunday. I?ve got to buy some flavor, so glad to know how they differ. I bought anise extract last year to make a new to me roll out cookie recipe but then I simply got tired of making roll out cookies, so I have an un-opened container of it in the cupboard. These look like they?d be less fuss than roll out cookies and a different but welcome holiday flavor. These are a little similar to the buttermilk cookies I?ve made (minus the anise, but I have used lemon), so buttermilk would be great. Now I want to find some anise extract!  Anise is not overpowering. Very pleasant taste."
169430,507045,2013/12/5,5,Anise is another of my favorite flavors and I am loving dunking these marvelous tiny biscotti&#039;s in my coffee. They are cute as the dickens and are just 2 bite size. You can&#039;t beat a classic but the cream cheese used here is great and something I wouldn&#039;t have thought about. I replaced the sugar with Splenda and used 95% fat free cream cheese.
400708,496619,2014/4/27,5,"Wanted to make Stromboli Ring for supper for something a little different and wanted a pizza crust instead of bread roll - this worked like a charm,. I divided the dough in half as there is only 2 of us and froze the 2nd half, worked like a charm.  Easy to roll out, and the perfect texture, I did add a teaspoon of italian seasoning to the dough when placing in the ABM.  So nice to have a recipe that lets the ABM do all the work.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
286566,507361,2013/12/20,5,I made 3 using granny smith apples and caramel chips and served with custard.

Thank you Debbwl. made for Everyday A Holiday tag game.
909692,507361,2014/11/4,5,We cut apples in half and scooped out a bit to make a bowl.  My son hates oats so we just used peanut butter and chocolate chips and he loved them!

363055,494676,2013/5/8,5,This is very delicious!!  Will make again.  Used V-8 juice instead of tomato juice.
4439,498173,2013/3/28,5,"This wonderful recipe is from one of my favorite new cookbooks and this is a great recipe that I have made several times and enjoyed. I like to cut split chicken breasts in half and use them instead of drumsticks, but drumsticks are delicious, too. Spicey, but not too spicey, easy to make, great with steamed brown rice pilaf and green salad with a nice balsamic dressing."
228458,503062,2013/8/8,5,"Wow, this was really terrific! I was looking for something to make the veggie crowd on a night when jerk chicken was on the menu, and this was great. Veg folks enjoyed it as a main and meat eaters loved it as a side. So flavorful, and really not too difficult to put together. I will admit to a shortcut; I just diced all of the onion and put all of the seasonings in together, skipping the food processor bit. I also added some fresh red pepper with the onions, and I highly recommend the addition! I did cook the potatoes a bit longer than instructed, just because we like them fairly tender. Even my 11 month old devoured this. Made for ZWT9, Gourmet Goddesses."
1052873,503062,2013/8/11,5,This was HOT. Maybe using 2 oz of ginger in a jar was not the same as the ginger in the recipe. The dietary wimpy people in my house couldn&#039;t handle it. I also used canned sweet potatoes and less broth because they were already cooked. Made for ZWT9.
2001584266,498366,2017/6/14,5,"The first time I ever tasted Cr&eacute;me Br&ucirc;l&egrave;e was at The Roof Restaurant. Lately, I've made attempts to make it, trying different recipes. They got better as my skills improved, but didn't quite have the rich deep flavor of The Roof's. I thought it might be because I used vanilla extract instead of the more expensive vanilla bean. But the secret is really the &quot;burnt&quot; sugar that sets The Roof's Cr&eacute;me Br&ucirc;l&egrave;e apart from the others. Just make sure that you only burn the sugar long enough to become a liquid caramel, and immediately whisk it into the still warm cream and egg yolk mixture. (My first attempt, I cooked it a bit too long, and it cooled to a hardened state before I could pour it into the cream). The soft, hot caramel will stick to the whisk like a delicate web at first, but keep whisking, it will eventually dissolve. Then pour the mixture through a sieve into another pourable container to keep any bits out I was able to get 19-2 oz servings out of this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!"

It was the perfect condiment for the bbq  hamburgers we had. The sauce brought the burger to a whole new level of goodness.  I can&#039;t wait to try this sauce on scrambled eggs, have a feeling I will be in heaven.

It didn&#039;t turn out orange as pictured or what I&#039;m use to in a restaurant.  It has green onions, parsley, and celery, so expect it to be green.  It wasn&#039;t very thick either.  I had to add mayo and extra cayenne for it to be palatable for me."

163112,502794,2013/10/21,4,"Interesting!  I wish I had added more harissa.  The meatballs were very tasty &amp; perfectly cooked.  I blanched 2 heads of cauliflower &amp; put all not used into a gratin dish, buried it in parmesan &amp; baked it until browned.  ;)  Everyone wishes there was more!  The oil &amp; tomato sauce did NOT want to mix.  I whisked it together as best i could.  The end result was very tasty.

1802649344,514791,2014/4/7,0,"As good as this soup is, I would be surprised if the chef&#039;s last name isn&#039;t Campbell! #mmmmmmmgood"
1802649209,514791,2014/4/7,5,This soup is my favorite of all the soups this chef has made.  I absolutely love it!  I add special touches to it like bacon bits and cheese; not that the soup needs it.  This is simply a simple recipe and delightful.

67728,536401,2018/8/11,5,"I just happened to have a perfectly ripe avocado, some tomatoes from the garden, and some warm fresh baguette in the house at the same time, AND I was thinking about lunch, so here we are! I seasoned my steak with Goya Adobo seasoning and a bit of applewood smoked salt and cooked them on my grill pan. I did add some more salt to the Chimichurri, too (personal preference). The end product is a tasty sandwich that is pretty as well, something that you would see on the menu at a nice cafe. Thanks for posting, PanNan! Made for SWT2018 Argentina by a fellow member of Team Fellowship of the Stove"
266635,510340,2014/1/2,5,"These pancakes were awesome!  Made them this morning and used the breakfast sausages as directed.  DH really enjoyed them with syrup, but I just enjoyed them all by themselves. I made mine on a electric griddle and they worked perfectly. Guess I should have some sugar-free syrup on hand, but I really think they are great without it.  I&#039;ll definitely make them again; especially for my grandkids -- they&#039;ll think I&#039;m the greatest Nana on earth -- and I am! : )  Made for PRMR, January, 2014."
461834,510340,2014/1/12,5,"What a fun and yummy breakfast/lunch for our Saturday!!  I am trying to avoid foods with preservatives for health reasons, so I skipped the baking/biscuit mix and made my own pancake mix, which is still close to the same type of pancake using Bisquick.  We also had some Johnsonville sausage links at home, so I cooked those up for the pigs!!  I bought real maple syrup recently to make a homemade granola that was made on a show on TV, so this was a perfect time to enjoy more of it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and congrats again on another win in the football pool game!!!"
296809,510340,2014/2/2,5,"Made for your Football Pool win &amp; I took a cpl of liberties because of where I am &amp; what is easily available. I made my own link sausages using Recipe #214213 (a pers fave since classic breakfast sausage is not available here). Then I used Krusteaz Pumpkin Spice Quick Bread Mix for the pancakes - a mix from a Seattle-based company designed to be used for quick bread, cookies &amp; pancakes. I know this changed the recipe substantially, but the basic intent was there &amp; the outcome was outstanding for a fall or winter holiday breakfast/brunch inspired by your recipe. Congrats on your 2nd FP win &amp; thx for sharing this recipe w/us.."
679953,510340,2014/5/18,5,"Nice little start to the morning.  Very easy, and flavorful too.  I had a couple extra strawberries, so I diced them up, and folded them into these.  Used the George Foreman grill for these, and it worked out very nice.  Made for PRMR TAG."
305531,510340,2014/9/15,5,"This was a fun breakfast to make. I used a different pancake mix from another tag (very similar) and we loved this quick and tasty treat. I can&#039;t wait to make these for my grandkids next time they&#039;re over. Or actually.....maybe they&#039;ll have fun making them for me. lol. Thanks, Rosie for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
165933,502717,2014/6/18,5,"This was really a hit with the family!  I only had vidalia onions so added one cup as they are a bit sweeter than normal onions.  By the time the chicken was cooked, the sauce had thickened beautifully and looked pretty spread over the chicken.  When I make this again I&#039;ll serve it with rice and perhaps add a sliced red pepper for color.  Thanks for a great recipe."
227978,508967,2017/10/30,5,"This was a great salad. The touch of thyme tossed with the walnuts was a great addition and gave the walnuts a bit of pizzazz. The chopped apple and raisins were a nice addition to the kale and Swiss Chard base. For the apple, I used Gala variety, and I think it worked well in this salad recipe. Sharon will be a dearly missed member of our group."
2146366,512536,2014/4/9,5,"This was so tasty! We had a PB&amp;J competition at my job and this entry took 2nd (1st was a very cute presentation). I used boneless skinless thighs, serving it on potato rolls."
2001074804,524062,2016/7/4,5,Awesome crepes ... this is my go to recipe! Thanks Seth ��
2001175286,524062,2016/9/19,5,"Wow! Put this together with the cream cheese spread, I added bacon and artichoke hearts for a savory meal. It was the bomb! Restaurant quality taste!"
2001325244,524062,2017/3/11,5,I love this recipe! I made manicotti with this crepe. YUM!
2002125596,524062,2018/4/22,5,Awesome crepes for Sunday mornings with the kids . Match it with a nice cup of coffee.
2002257830,524062,2018/8/27,5,"Easiest cr&ecirc;pes I ever made; no more fussing with ingredients, club soda, etc...made them with Nutella for a bunch of girls after a sleepover. Total hit!"
383346,497756,2013/4/18,5,The sauce has an amazing taste with the red wine.  The seasoning are perfect.  Usually my son don&#039;t always like meat sauce but this one he likes it.  This is a recipe I will do often.  Thanks Maureen :)  Made for PAC Spring 2013
107135,513449,2014/3/11,5,this is so good and easy also
482376,527343,2016/7/22,5,"We loved this soup! It's hearty and full of flavor. I used chicken broth vs. water. We loved all the veggies, cooked perfectly, and the spicy sausage. Yum! I'm glad I made this authentic soup you posted. Thank you!"
865936,492862,2013/1/4,5,"Even though I've seen these spices in other cuisines, for some reason they are absolutely delicious in this combination and proportion.  I used it to season cauliflower and sweet potato chunks I was roasting.  I stirred it into some rice also.  Then I stirred it all together."
47892,492862,2013/1/16,5,"I have no reference for comparing this mixture to other recipes, but it worked out really well in this main dish: Recipe #492975. There's a little bit left and I will try it on roasted cauliflower in the next few days. Reviewed for NA*ME Explores Oman."
724631,492862,2013/10/13,5,"This mix is on a website proclaiming to be an &quot;Omani Kitchen&quot;, so it appears to be authentic.  This was much milder than I expected; perhaps I need fresh spices.  I used this in Recipe#492972."
37449,494102,2013/2/11,5,Yum! A great recipe with great flavors. I loved the whole garlic cloves. Thanks Sue! Made for Rookie tag game.
1713856,494102,2014/3/31,5,"I&#039;ve used this recipe so many times since first seeing it, it&#039;s become a staple at our home.  I&#039;m sorry I took so long to remember to get my act together and leave a review.  The recipe is easy and very good.  I&#039;ve served it to family and guests on many occasions, and even those reluctant to eat brussels sprouts (presumably from traumatic sprout experiences in the distant past) comment on how good this recipe is.  As with most things, I add more of the spices than the recipe calls for, but I like things to be extra flavorful.  That also goes for the parmesan cheese."
2000821058,494102,2017/2/24,0,"Good, but it needs a touch of more acid &quot;bite.&quot; Suggestions?"
2001521387,494102,2017/5/4,5,Amazing thank you here's a picture of before
1271506,519113,2017/8/14,5,Delicious -- and *so* easy! Will definitely make this again; thanks for posting!
2000606582,527141,2017/1/25,5,"Best tasting sloppy joes around. Forget the canned stuff, I'll never use it again. So savory and sweet."
461834,496107,2013/3/31,5,"The title says it all!!!  I made these, using several slices of a homemade sourdough bread that I had made the day before making this recipe.  I let the slices sit out for several hours, to dry them out more, then followed as written for 1/2 of the recipe, until the first flipping/turning in the fry pan.  They weren&#039;t evenly browned in the fry pan, so I decided to put them in the oven (since it was already on and cooking the main entree) to get a more even browning, which worked like a charm.  Next time, I would just mix up the bread and garlic, oil in a bowl, then sprinkle with some sea salt and parmesan cheese and bake and turn till well browned.  But, anyway you do it, so yummy!!!  Thanks for sharing another great recipe!!  Made for Spring 2013 &quot;Pick A Chef&quot; event."
37449,496107,2014/1/24,4,Loved the flavors and next time will bake them like diner said. Thanks! :)
869184,496107,2014/3/30,5,I went with Diner&#039;s suggestion and baked them instead of the pan method. They were simple to make yet delicious. I used a day old baquette.
461834,503735,2013/7/15,5,"Yum, yum, yummy!!!  I love to make my own version of Eggs Benedict, and this made that version even better!!  I made 1/3 of the recipe and there was plenty for one serving, so I think the full recipe would serve 3 full orders of eggs benedict.  Other then scaling it back, the only other change I made was to cut back on the hot sauce, I am a wimp when it comes to heat.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
480195,503735,2013/7/23,5,"This was fabulous served over cauliflower. We all loved the way it gave the cauliflower some extra zip. Thanks for sharing the recipe, which I will use often."
222478,503735,2014/2/28,5,Delicious! I made 2/3 of the quantity for two servings and that was plenty. I made an omelette with the reserved egg whites and served along with some bacon in a roll which made a great light lunch.
305531,517918,2014/8/16,5,Delicious muffins. These were simple to make and very tasty. The directions were clear and well written. Thanks Jackie for sharing your great creation. Made for Cornbread is King (Part 2).
169430,517918,2014/8/16,5,"Really lovely cornbread muffins. I went just a bit heavier on the chives as mine are growing insanely this year. I think they are planning a coup to take over the yard! But I digress, the recipe took just a few mins to put together and they are delicious.  Perfect with grilled chicken  and a light fruit salad. Well done Jackie. Made for Cornbread is King,Part 2."
1680722,517918,2014/8/17,5,"I&#039;m glad I tried these cornbread muffins for Made for Cornbread is King (Part 2)!&lt;br/&gt;This is a quick and simply recipe, I had all on hand and I the garden I had enogh chives for this.&lt;br/&gt;My DD was the first who tired this, we never had cornbread and she was really surprised how good the are. Great recipe!"
107135,517918,2014/9/20,5,good cakepops on parade hope you are having fun lol dee
461834,517918,2014/9/21,5,"Wonderful easy recipe for cornbread muffins!!!  I made these as written with the exception of using melted butter for the oil.  Served these with a crock pot pinto bean and ham hock recipe, yummy!!!  I liked that these weren&#039;t very sweet like most cornbread recipes.  Thanks for sharing/making this recipe.  Made for CQ 2014."
2001276933,519885,2016/11/30,5,"I was so amazed how good these carrots tasted. Very full of flavor. Soft but not mushy. Aromatic. This cooking method transformed a boring side into the highlight of our meal, something that took the entire family by surprise."
266635,534108,2018/11/9,5,What a great recipe for corn casserole. The dish was easy to make and the results were excellent. Served this casserole with grilled steak/mushrooms and your slow cooker cheesy potatoes. My DH loved this meal and the corn casserole.
1680722,510903,2014/12/3,5,"I could not resist this recipe! The idea of a salted caramel convinced me to try it. I had no problem with the dough, but as I was melting the sugar with butter I saw that this igredients did not come together, Perhaps I should have used finelly grinded brown sugar. I saw a lot of fat and I was tempted to add something to bind them. I had ground almonds ready but I waited a little bit while it was cooling liitle bit and ....oh... the ingredients came together before I added the almonds. Everything was OK for me now. I used a round springform of 10 inches and for this reason I cutted rombus instead squares. Soo good and beautiful! Thanks a lot for posting this great recipe!"
461834,510903,2014/12/15,5,"OMG!!!  These are so rich and delicious!!  I made this exactly as written with the exception of using almonds, instead of cashews, as none of us are fans of cashews.  The only problem I had was the cookie base was very crumbly (if that is a word, lol) and fell apart upon cutting into bars, but it is so good, who cares!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe that will now be part of my Christmas cookies each year!!  Made for Sweet December event."
266635,510903,2014/12/18,5,"These cashew bars are delicious -- very rich, but oh sooo good.  I&#039;m not much of a baker, but these bars are very easy to make and they come out perfectly.  My DH is loving them, but I&#039;ve rationed him to just one or two a day. : )  A great holiday or any time treat.  Will definitely make these again.  Made for the Sweet December tag game."
2001102678,510903,2017/4/28,5,Thanks Debbie wl
2001182097,528319,2016/9/25,5,"Very good recipe, wide open for style variations such as asian, greek, and American with just a few small tweeks. I prefer it Asian style with soy and sesame oil."
2549237,502294,2013/7/5,3,"This is a good recipe.  Not very spicy, next time I will add more chipotles chiles in adobo sauce and maybe a little more molasses.  Also, I think this would be great over a baked potato with some cheese and sour cream.  Many possibilities with this one.  Thank WiGal.  Made for the New Kids On The Block tag game."
2894200,502294,2013/7/10,5,"We loved this recipe! We made a few minor substitutions as I forgot some of the ingredients when I went shopping, but it was yummy. We substituted regular cabbage coleslaw for the broccoli coleslaw and honey and brown sugar for the molasses. We made soft tacos with them and they were great! The meat was full of flavor. We will be making this again soon!"
2887894,502853,2013/7/3,3,good recipe.
107583,503841,2013/8/26,5,A great spice mix made with ingredients I always have in my cupboard.  Great as a rub on some chicken thighs.  Made for ZWT 9.
558429,503841,2013/10/8,5,Versatile and tasty. I like to rub this all over a whole chicken and &quot;roast&quot; it in the crockpot. The smell is to die for! Thanks for posting.
204024,503841,2013/12/28,5,Great mix for a rub.  No cayenne too spicey.
340141,499403,2013/5/29,4,This was very good;  particularly liked the taste of tarragon with the other ingredients.  I should have held back a little on the cheese however; it was really rich.
306726,494784,2013/2/5,5,Such a wonderful combination of flavors and textures!!!
2198132,494784,2013/2/5,5,Great recipe!!  Love the flavor combo!!

2415384,494784,2013/2/12,5,Fantastic
140132,494784,2013/6/17,5,"I was skeptical over this but fear not its delicious.  I made this for my family and we loved loved loved it.  The chicken got a nice crunch from the granola and panko.  I was worried the granola would make this sweet, but it wasn&#039;t overpowering.  Thank you for this really nice salad recipe that is great in the summertime."
191533,494784,2014/1/5,5,Tasty crumb coating! Note to self- don&#039;t substitute plain mayo for dipping the chicken. The thick wet coating doesn&#039;t allow the crumbs to stay crunchy.
2679701,494787,2013/2/5,5,This has to be hands down one of the best Chicken Kara-age recipes I've ever had! It even puts mainstream restaurants to shame on just how juicy and awesome the chicken is when you bite into it. Highly recommended for everyone to try.
945395,494787,2013/8/14,5,"This is delicious -- absolutely delicious, and I thank you for your flawless recipe!"
2001087685,494787,2016/7/14,5,"Excellent recipe! I added about 1 tsp sesame oil to the marinade. Used corn starch, as I was out of Katakuriko (potato starch). Deep fried the marinaded chicken pieces about 90 seconds. Took them out and placed them on a wire rack. After I deep fried the whole batch, I deep fried them again for about 45 seconds. Came out crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Tastes better when it's hot. But, cold was okay too."
2001399255,494787,2017/2/20,5,"Great recipe! Just like the karaage I get from the local Japanese store in Vancouver. I haven't found any restaurants that do it like this. Juicy and tasty! You really need the potato starch to do it correctly (I found some at Whole Foods). I would recommend garnishing with little wedges of lemon. Adds the perfect zip when squeezed onto the fried chicken. I've made this twice--once deep-fried and once shallow-fried. They turned out the same, so I will shallow-fry from now on to avoid using insane amounts of oil. Thank you!"
2001919228,494787,2018/1/8,5,Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out awesome. Thanks!!!
2001955898,494787,2018/1/27,5,"I made this and it was so good. It needed some salt but other than that it was great. I cooked for 3 minutes, let it sit for 5 minutes and cooked again for another minute. I also made a sauce which consisted of 1/2 cup mayo, 3Tbs of light corn syrup, 2 Tbs spicy mustard, a few sprinkles of sugar and 3Tbs soy sauce. It was very tasty. Thanks."
2000337357,494788,2015/7/13,5,"Not made it ,just found it but sounds lovely"
4439,504948,2013/7/30,0,"Sounds interesting, and something I would try, but the carbs and cholesterol values are beyond my weekly limit, so i will have to pass."
1060667,528585,2016/11/21,5,Yummy! The only change I made was that I used grape jam instead of the raspberry. SO GOOD!!! Topped with some powdered sugar :)
2001402443,536469,2018/11/9,4,"I actually made this! This was actually quite easy to assemble. My only critiques is I would maybe make the cakes a more gooey version of rice krispie and nix the Buttercream, not sure. The Buttercream starts to get a little messy. But the kids loved it. The strawberry layer has the strongest taste so I'd take the gelatin back a notch next time. I'm just still impressed I actually made it and they loved it and it was edible and really presentable. Well worth trying and I will do for a birthday again, thank you!"
2324285,504228,2013/7/28,5,"This is indeed lovely and refreshing!  Great for summer, and so quick and easy to make.  The watermelon created a really nice dressing for the salad.  I had this with some crusty bread that I baked in the oven with some shredded Gruyere cheese on top."
2000386977,504228,2015/8/6,5,"This was lovely! I substituted the olive oil for the white cooking wine I cooked the shrimp in, and it still turned out great. This is the perfect blend. I will probably be eating this on a weekly basis!"
2001465009,530645,2017/3/31,5,It was delicious! Turned out good for me. Taste just like shrimp scampi. Though I can't find round wrapers here in my area to make it look like these. The square ones work fine. Will be making it again very soon. Might try with crab.
1802686027,530645,2017/4/1,0,"I agree with Anonymous. The instructions for this recipe are skimpy, at best, and the ingredients should have been listed in the order they're used, rather than all over the map, like after-thoughts. Thank you, Anonymous, for clarifying the directions."
13022744,530645,2017/5/24,5,"turned out much better than I expected! I added a little more garlic and also a little more corn starch, as my mixture was a bit runny. Came out super yummy! I will definitely make these again."
2001051242,530645,2017/5/25,5,"I used to be scared of cooking shrimp at home — for no good reason — but after making these potstickers, I can't get enough. I think the combination of classic flavors (hello, butter and garlic!) plus the fun activity of stuffing the dumplings made the whole process so fun and tasty. I'm going to be making these for a dinner party I'm hosting next week, and I know everyone is going to be asking for the recipe."
2000471816,530645,2017/9/19,5,Made it and it was easy. So easy to take for lunch at work. This is a keeper. Thank you.
2000174754,530645,2017/9/19,0,I couldn't find your recipe video. Where is it?
2001950899,530645,2018/1/24,0,Cannot wait to try these. My one question is serving size. I printed the recipe and it yields 20 potstickers but nutritionally it says serving size is 1 and servings per recipe is 1. So is the actual serving size 1?
2001337716,526499,2017/1/5,5,I really like it.....so easy to make and really nice taste.....what i added is just some green chilli &amp; 1/4 tomato....thanks...really like it....!!!
2002218712,530533,2018/7/15,5,First time I ever tried to bake a Milk Tart. What a success. Tastes great. Just have patience when making the custard. This recipe rates a 5
107135,492860,2013/1/9,5,i loved this i used 1/2 honey and 1/2 sugar  i get the flowers for this at a mexican store  im drinking it warm right now
163112,492860,2013/1/9,5,"Quick, easy & soothing when hot.  I've been eyeing this since first added to the 'Exploring Oman' cb but made it when the yukkies started to move into my body.  You can SMELL the vitamin c.  ;)  I'm drinking it warm today but will enjoy this in the summer, too.  I did add extra cloves & ginger just because I like it strong.  Mmmmm...thank you!"
2000949491,520866,2016/3/30,5,Very easy to make and fast
2000907424,520866,2017/3/23,5,I recently prepared this recipe and it was a big hit with my dinner guest. This recipe is definitely a keeper.
163112,518243,2014/9/15,5,Yum!  I used bok choy.  The only change I made was to use soy sauce instead of salt. Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ/Family Picks.
1609858,501985,2013/7/18,0,"I can&#039;t give this a rating, I just wanted to make a note, because I made an altered version.  I tried this recipe using graham cracker crumbs and chocolate chips instead of the &quot;chunks&quot; of graham crackers and chocolate bars.  It was what I had on hand and I thought I might like it better as I don&#039;t always like a lot of extra texture in brownies.  However the crumbs and chips pretty much just blend into the batter and don&#039;t really stand out taste wise that way.  Basically what I got were regular brownies with marshmallows.  They tasted fine, they just weren&#039;t very &quot;s&#039;morey.&quot;  I will try again sometime as written and give this a real review, just wanted to let anyone else thinking about cheating not to bother."
37449,504303,2013/8/2,5,"Lovely, simple,easy to prepare. Thanks! Made for Team Hot Stuff for ZWT#9-2013."
1052873,504303,2013/8/2,5,This was excellent - served with Recipe #275982. Used honey mustard. Made for ZWT9.
329769,504303,2013/8/3,5,Reviewed for ZWT9- delicious !  The perfect partner to grilled salmon. I used fresh dill from my herb garden and added some extra lemon juice to thin the consistency a little. A definite make again sauce for us. Photos also being posted
251917,504303,2014/1/29,5,Aussie Swap#84: Outstanding recipe! We made this as a dipping sauce for meats cooked in our fondue pot and it was the perfect compliment!
246482,504303,2017/8/26,5,I just made a bit of it and I really enjoyed the taste and I added a bit on my noodles at the same tim . Made for CQ 2017.
65502,504303,2017/8/27,5,This was a very easy sauce to make and very good with cod too! It would actually be great with any seafood and even chicken. I used a really grainy dijon mustard (personal preference) and forgot to set some dill aside for the top but it went to good use in the mixture. Thanks!
296809,504303,2017/8/31,5,Made exactly as written for the Scandinavian region of CQ4 &amp; the Happy Campers team - I have a recipe much like this one that I refer to as &quot;My Personal Treasure&quot;. I discovered it when I came to Iceland &amp; I fell in love w/using it the same way Scandinavians do -- Atop smoked salmon &amp; smoked trout appies. So I decided to do that using your sauce as you see in the pic. This is very good Kathy &amp; also works well w/a variety of meats on an antipasto tray for example. I'm sure the 2 of us will find a ton more ways to share it w/our family &amp; friends. Thx for inspiring me again. :-)
1802599188,522400,2015/6/27,5,Mmmm...bacon! I sprinkled some Bad Byron&#039;s Butt Rub over these before baking and it was perfect. I&#039;m going to make these in my Big Green Egg next time to get them nice and smokey.
2834004,522400,2016/10/27,5,Now that's my kind of bouquet. Classy!
2000326132,522400,2016/10/27,5,I'm requesting a dozen for next Valentine's Day!
2191465,522400,2018/3/7,5,Love this idea! I made these for Valentine's Day and they were a huge hit.
560491,507348,2014/5/14,5,This is more of a slushie than smoothie; but whatever it is called it is delicious!  Made without the mint and it still was fresh and not too sweet.  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
1625919,510219,2016/10/12,5,"Love this recipe! I used it for my turkey on Thanksgiving. SO GOOD! I would suggest putting the softened butter on the bird first, before the spices to avoid clumping."
2000873894,516828,2016/2/14,1,"The cake turned out very dry, although I used more than the required amount of bananas - will not make this again :o"
226863,502280,2013/7/27,5,"The chicken is the star here!  I&#039;ll make this again and serve it as the protein part of a meal with other vegetables as well.  Today I used baby spinach, swiss chard, and arugula.  I didn&#039;t have grape tomatoes, but I did have some ripe tomatoes on my tomato plant, so just sliced some up for the salad.  Used wonderful basil that I have growing on my deck....and this recipe was so fresh and tasty!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PRMR tag game."
695933,502280,2013/11/7,5,"Sometimes the simplest recipes turn out to be some of the best!&lt;br/&gt;This was nice for something different but will stay a distant second from classic chicken salad, mostly because if you don&#039;t like Parmesan cheese (like hubs), basil or fresh, raw garlic, you certainly won&#039;t like this. I love it all, but was glad I reduced the amounts of all three by nearly half. I loved the subtle flavors they contributed, but can&#039;t imagine using the full measurements called for! Not sure of what pureeing the celery was, but I did, but I also added some sliced celery as well for texture and crunch. I served this over Romaine lettuce leaves with hard boiled eggs and sliced tomatoes on the side and it made for a light, but satisfying lunch. Thank You ....PRMR 2013.....Grpa"
1783373,502280,2014/2/28,4,"Definitely not the same ole, same ole chicken!  Love the herbs and parmesan cheese flavors. I added a tad more of the herbs and wasn&#039;t disappointed.  Also used plum tomatoes because that&#039;s what I had available in my refrigerator.  Though the flavor of the chicken was yummy, it did need some salt and pepper to enhance the flavors.  Used arugula (Love arugula), but next time will use mixed greens (love those too).  Found that the juice from 2 lemons was too much in ratio to the olive oil, therefore used juice of 1 1/2 lemons and found that it was pretty strong on acidity level.  This is a refreshing perfect dinner, especially on those hot summer days.  Thank you rpgaymer for sharing!  Tagged it for PRMR."
37449,504978,2013/10/10,5,"I used veggie hot dogs, halved the recipe, used homemade Bisquick mix from a recipe here on food.com, used soy milk, left out the horseradish and thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! Thanks Dienia! Made for PRMR game."
254614,508882,2013/11/6,5,I love this recipe. I shredded one-half of the beef for the soup. I am a fan of balsamic vinegar and sweet white onions served many ways. I also reserved some of onions to serve with saut&eacute;ed mushrooms tomorrow. Thank you for posting.
107583,514895,2014/4/30,5,"Excellent potatoes.  I cut recipe down for two and used Yukons, which I didn&#039;t peel.  Great flavor and really easy to make.  (I used my toaster oven).  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
169430,514895,2014/5/4,5,"Yummy side taters for tonight&#039;s chicken dish. No big hassle in preparation and they came out golden brown on the outside and tender on the inside with great flavor. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
128473,514895,2014/5/9,5,"Wow, we loved these tasty tatters.  They were so quick and easy to throw together, on the table before we knew it.  Soft, tender, crispy and full of flavors.  These buttery tasting potatoes had the right ratio of salt, pepper and rosemary, to create an extra special treat.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  Made and enjoyed for Spring Pac 2014."
1802667547,507345,2014/4/14,1,"The white vinegar turned the turkey into some kind of inedible styrofoam.  Such a waste of good food, we couldn&#039;t even choke it down.  Do not try."
2001183515,520532,2016/9/25,5,"Excellent and easy! The balsamic vinegar, tomato paste, and yellow mustard are subtle but add just the right amount of flavor. I added celery and doubled the broth - it's a bit more soup-like, but still plenty thick."
2399085,513463,2014/2/22,5,"PRMR!!! Very flavorable peas. As you note stated, I cut back the water by 1 cup. This was really intimadiating as so many ingredients but it was well worth the effort. I am not a huge fan of peas but these were good. Even one of my children enjoyed!!!"
2324285,513463,2014/4/18,5,"Loved it!  Before putting everything in the slow cooker, I decided to fry the spices in some ghee for about 10 minutes, then added the tomato mixture and fried that up a as well.  This really deepened the flavor in the end, I&#039;m sure.  I used 6 cups of water instead of 9, and this seemed like the right amount.  It came out like a creamy bean curry, basically- somewhere between soup and chili in consistency.  Served over quinoa and topped with mango chutney.  Thanks for posting another great recipe from this cookbook!"
131126,513463,2014/6/13,5,"What a delightful surprise! I used canned tomatoes, 6 cups of water, and only one pepper. I also added sliced carrots, celery, and a handful of coconut shredds.  The result was a tasty thick-ish soup.  The batch made a very full crockpot. I froze in small 3 cup bags for future meals and it&#039;s reheated wonderfully.  This recipe is going into my meatless cookbook. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
2001195213,515959,2016/10/5,0,OMG This recipe is really the only one that comes close to the Stouffers recipe only I had to add a little paprika to kick up my taste buds memory.
400708,507750,2013/12/29,5,"My cup was obviously to big - but I&#039;ll just make a larger serving next time as this stuff is AWESOME!!  The perfect drink for these cold winter eves.  Love the spice with the rum and I used vanilla cinnamon infused Irish Cream and then foamed the milk in my cuppachino maker.  I&#039;m in heaven, just the right spices with the coffee and creamy goodness.  This could quickly become a habit it&#039;s sooooo good, I&#039;m not sharing with anyone."
128473,507750,2014/3/27,5,"Thank you Anna for another wonderful coffee recipe.  I have been swept away to the Island mon.  I used Jamaica Rum and both of the spice options.  It was really very tasty, garnished with a little whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I&#039;ll be making this one again."
679953,507750,2014/5/27,5,"VERY NICE.. :)    I used nutmeg, and left out the sugar.   Very flavorful, and made some for the DS also.  Made for PRMR TAG."
359651,515683,2014/5/2,1,Everyone knows you must add about a teas.of salt per quart of water. Otherwise it&#039;s blandsville.
169430,503129,2013/7/14,5,"Really outstanding! I made this for breakfast going somewhat lighter on the booze (it wasn&#039;t quite 7 am!). I&#039;m telling you, there are some advantages to old age! :rofl:. Loved the citrus and spice mix and used Splenda for the sugar. YUM!! Made for ZWT 9."
107135,503129,2013/7/23,5,"ok cloves and cinnamon  sticks  go in with coffee  grounds.  sugar  and peels  go into carafe  brandy goes in cups where it cannot ignite accidentally , and burn your house down lol zwt9"
895132,503129,2013/7/26,5,"Wowsers, this sure has a kick! Made this *not* for breakfast and used the whole amount of brandy. Really outstanding! Thanks for posting.&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Creole and Cajun for The Apron String Travelers"
139381,505249,2013/8/5,5,"I already do this, and it&#039;s wonderful, especially during the winter months.  In winter, I have to add a bit of humidity to the air in my home, and this helps.  One addition I do make to the &quot;recipe&quot;, is that I also freeze my orange peels and add them to the mix."
763912,507105,2013/9/21,4,"This combination is great.  I like to add fennel as well.  I use coconut oil and a little mixed seasoning of whatever I have on hand.  for the salt, a little Real Salt.  Very nice.  Thanks"
1925885,507105,2014/9/12,5,"This was great and I&#039;ll make it again! I was a bit skeptical at first because the combo just didn&#039;t seem to fit - but it melds together beautifully!  I didn&#039;t read the previous review, and may try the coconut oil next time. I&#039;d also like to try this the next time I&#039;m in the States, as the sweet potatoes we get here are so different - they&#039;re white and not all that appealing to look at (though the flavor is good!)."
1706426,496427,2013/3/12,4,"Pretty good! I had to change it a but though due to the ingredients I had on hand. I used a can of tomatoes with green chilies, taco seasoning and tortilla chips. Also,I added an egg to bind spread salsa on top to prevent drying. It does taste like a taco! Thanks for posting!"
502302,494382,2013/2/12,4,"Hmm... this was definitely out of the ordinary. It has a very ""light"" presentation. I liked it OK but not sure if it is something that I would be drawn to again. Maybe in the summer... it would go well with summer food."
400708,494382,2013/2/20,5,"We really liked this, light and easy to fix - with nice fresh flavors.  I did use basil instead of parsley but that was the only change.  The combo of lemon and cheese made for a nice, different presentation for one of our favorite veggies.  Made for Rookie Tag 2012"
2585084,494382,2013/4/14,5,"While eating dinner, my husband said, &quot;good cauliflower.&quot;  He was so right. (This comes from a man who says he is never right!).  This dish was light and delicious.  I have never thought about pairing lemon with cauliflower-it works."
169430,494382,2013/8/27,5,"This was really a yummy side with tonight&#039;s meatloaf. I had to use frozen cauliflower but it worked well, it just didn&#039;t take as long to cook. I added some extra lemon because it&#039;s one of my favorite things. The parsley was fresh out of the yard and even DH enjoyed it. :D"
482933,494382,2013/9/11,5,"What a great recipe to showcase cauliflower! Lemon, garlic, parsley, and Parmesan compliment it.   Made as posted except I put all the parsley in with the water. The sauce is not thick but there to spoon onto plate."
482376,494382,2015/1/15,5,"Simple, healthy and yummy! I love the combination of lemon, garlic, parmesan. It&#039;s a great way to cook cauliflower. Thank you!"
47892,494382,2015/5/11,5,"This veggie side dish paired beautifully with snapper almondine. I chose to steam the cauliflower minus the lemon peel and parsley. This would also work well with other vegetables, too. I added some asparagus for color. Freshly grated Grana Padano cheese to top it all off. The cauliflower and parsley were from our CSA box and were made good use of! Prepared for the FYI tag game."
2000178961,494382,2016/3/13,3,"I didn&#039;t think this was anything special.  I suppose if you&#039;re looking for something low-fat, it&#039;s not bad.  If you really want to try something special this recipe is to die for:

2324285,503609,2013/7/21,4,"Pretty good!  I wish I had used goat meat, but I couldn&#039;t find it.  The beef worked fine, and didn&#039;t require as long to cook.  I used yams instead of potatoes, and threw in some peas.  It turned out like a hearty stew, so I didn&#039;t even have to serve it with rice!  The thyme in this was my favorite part- it makes it taste very different from most curries I&#039;ve had."
2000921773,503609,2016/3/15,5,Made it and it came out delicious!
158308,503609,2016/10/18,5,"Amazingly tasty recipe! I made this twice, once with lamb to be sure I liked the recipe, and then with goat short ribs. I made my own jamaican curry powder (just google it and find the one that shows up in a couple of places with plenty of allspice in it) for use in the recipe. I also used some dried chile pepper instead of the chopped habernero pepper. Both times I made this recipe it was just soooooo good! I served it on either good plain steamed rice or quinoa. I added a carrot to the potatoes, as I don't eat potatoes. Otherwise I followed the recipe and was just amazed at how delicious it is. Thanks for posting!"
1802679874,530386,2017/2/21,5,Mouth watering deliciousness. So good! If this didn't have pasta in it I'd eat it every day! Maybe I could make this with zoodles..........
126440,520819,2015/1/28,5,This was so good and just what I have been looking for.  Made half a recipe but used turkey stock and cut the noodle dough like dumplings.  There was flour listed in the instructions but not ingredient list so guessed at 1/4 c.  will use less celery seed next time.  Still have some left over for lunch.  YUM!
179906,493844,2013/1/20,5,I like making this too.But instead of chicken broth and liquid from can of beans I buy ham base (usually located where bouillon cubes and powders are). I check broth towards end of cooking time to see how much flavor has come out of the ham then add a couple tsps of ham base to boost ham flavor.
266635,512759,2014/2/26,5,"This is a delicious hearty soup - we really enjoyed it very much.  The only change I made was to substitute potatoes for the parsnips as I did not have them and I left out the celery as DH is just not a celery fan.  Otherwise, made as directed and it was sooo good.  Made for PRMR, February, 2014."
706839,512759,2014/9/14,5,Very good!  I added some diced ham and a few splashes of red wine vinegar before garnishing with shaved parmesan and a drizzle of quality olive oil.  Yum!
339260,506326,2014/4/17,5,"I made this cake with some changes to the ingredients to make it diabetic friendly.  I used sugar-free substitutes for the yellow cake mix, frozen whipped topping and vanilla instant pudding.  I also used unsweetened applesauce in place of the 1/3 cup of oil.  This recipe is super, super easy to throw together, smells terrific and is moist and very tasty.  I took it to work to share with my coworkers and everyone loved it.  They were very surprised to find out that it was almost sugar free (the only sugars were from the canned fruit).  I will be making this again for some of our summer cookouts.  Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2014."
845199,532077,2018/3/18,0,"These are very good. It took waaaay longer than 8 minutes for mine to set up though. I made these for my teen athlete. He swims 2 hours a day 6 days a week. These will be a great, nutritious snack for him. I would like to freeze them. I am going to give it a try. I made mine cupcake sized and i got 18 total"
599450,504900,2013/8/11,5,"This is so good! Made as directed. Really appreciated the US measurements, too. DH said that this dough is also perfect for placing a hotdog inside of -- he&#039;s so right! Next time &quot;Festival Dogs&quot; for lunch! Lol!. Thanks for a great recipe, Tisme. Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
1052065,495787,2013/2/19,5,Perfectly easy..my daughter loves olives so this is wonderful! Thanks for sharing AmyZoe!
377161,507982,2013/10/19,5,Added a scoop of yogurt (plain) and loved it!!! Great combination. Thank You!!!
2002074708,507982,2018/3/25,4,Pretty good!
107135,503606,2013/7/23,5,"wowser these were good,i only made 1 ,cause i knew i was going  to love or hate them.i just used a little ouzo .make these ,the ingredients  sound strange but it worked for me zwt9 dog gone stars,really good"
37449,503606,2013/7/24,5,Yummy little buggers! I too made only one to test it out. Good results. Made for team Hot Stuff for ZWT#9-2013.
383346,503606,2013/7/27,4,Me and DH liked these but my parents didn&#039;t as much.  The ouzo for them was too much.  Thanks Mikekey :)  Made for ZWT9
1802623856,514973,2014/4/3,4,I make a pretty good potato stack so I had to try this out. It&#039;s delicious! I cut the tomatoes pretty thick because I feel like they cook down so much.  I also had never tried the toothpick trick and it actually kept the stacks form much better than the muffin tin which I always do.  Thanks for the new tip.  I will be doing that in the future.
1802643348,514973,2014/4/5,5,"Tomatoes aren&#039;t my favorite thing to eat but add cheese, potatoes and bacon... Yes please."
1802646004,514973,2014/4/6,5,"This is a hidden gem of a recipe.  I love potatoes with my steak but I started getting tired of same old same old.  I love when I go to a steakhouse and get a baked potato, bleu cheese salad, and they sometimes add one of those roasted tomatoes on the side.  This recipe combined all 3!!! Genius!   The only problem was I only did 4 stacks and had no leftovers :("
1802639878,514973,2014/4/6,5,"Yum, yum, yum.  I have reviewed a few of these recipes on the 5 ingredient list because that is all I&#039;m really capable of in the kitchen.  This is a recipe that took the cake for me.  I must admit I cut tomato extra thick and did a ton of bleu cheese crumbles and it was out of this world.  I would actually use this as a breakfast/brunch recipe as well even though it seems a lot of people are using it as a side dish for dinner.  Definitely going to be a recipe I use again."
46236532,506602,2013/11/25,4,"It was a great recipe. I replaced the bread crumbs with saltine crackers and had a few add-ins; I added some minced and saut&eacute;ed onions, garlic and scallions and also topped the loaf with a glaze made out of ketchup, brown sugar and a dash of paprika, Knorr liquid seasoning and tabasco sauce before baking. Baked it for an hour in a greased loaf pan (no thermometer needed) and turned out moist and juicy. I paired it with mashed potatoes and some vegetables. Will definitely make it again. :)"
1802625199,514973,2014/4/6,5,This is a great idea. I am a great cook but never thought of putting these flavors all together.  It&#039;s the right combination and I loved it.I bet this would be a great scalloped potato bake as well!  YUMMM!!!
1785900,504434,2013/9/21,5,"This is similar to my mother&#039;s Norwegian apple cake, and I was able to convert it to gluten free simply by substituting a gluten free flour mix, 1 tsp. of xanthan gum, and an extra egg. I also cut the butter  in half and added 1/2 cup milk.  Delicious, fast and a wonderful way to use up extra apples!"
809202,504434,2014/10/15,2,Is 2 tablespoons of grated lemon peel correct? You can&#039;t get that from 1/2 a lemon. 2 teaspoons perhaps?
37449,514062,2014/3/18,5,"Yum! I halved the recipe and did add just a touch of sugar to the dressing. Much enjoyed, thanks!"
2001537455,507192,2017/5/14,5,It's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good!
2001324275,507192,2018/4/9,5,"This is the bomb! If you haven't made this, you are missing out on all this deliciousness!! This is very rich...a little goes a long way! The balsamic reduction makes this recipe. Do NOT skip it!"
2001329932,506738,2017/5/1,4,"A simplified breakfast-based dessert, this cookie is made with real chocolate and vanilla to make it look rich and sweet."
498271,497219,2013/5/17,5,"Wow this is a terrific recipe!  Used yellow onion instead of red and made half the recipe.  Just loved the apples with the brussels, a lovely combination.  The dressing is fantastic and I loved the addition of the mustard seeds too.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
482933,497219,2013/9/19,5,Lovely  Brussels sprouts recipe! Dressing is a tad sour so next time I would reduce vinegar slightly. Used crisp bacon that I have frozen and stirred that in about 10 minutes before serving . I prepped this earlier except for apple. Served with recipe#294925 and recipe#504145.
695933,497219,2013/12/21,5,"One of our friends, who doesn&#039;t like brussels sprouts, asked for seconds! You really must try these. Perfect for an elegant dinner party but easy enough for a busy weeknight meal. But they were pleasantly surprised to me. Sered with recipe#511084 . Take that as all thumbs up. Awesome recipe! Thank You! PRMR 2013 Grpa"
400708,497219,2013/12/22,5,"I made this with only 2 changes based on what I had available.  Used bacon and a sweet white onion.  The rest I followed and what an awesome recipe.  The blend of spices brings out the perfect mix of smoky bacon, tart vinegar and sweet.  I used a very good balsamic vinegar and glad I did.  There was only DH and me and between us we ate the entire batch and enjoyed every bite of it.  Served with grilled pork chops and baked potato and a glass of Washington&#039;s best red wine.  Very pleasant meal, simple and fast - I&#039;ll be using this one a lot"
724631,497219,2014/1/31,5,"What a sumptuous side dish, perfect for holiday dinners!  At our dinner table there were some odd remarks: from a Brussels sprouts lover, &quot;the Brussels sprouts didn&#039;t stand out&quot;, and from a Brussels sprouts avoider, &quot;this was good, but I wouldn&#039;t call this a Brussels sprouts dish because so much was going on.&quot;  The rest of us just loved the recipe because it tasted so good!  I loved how easy this was, too.  Made for Best of 2013 tag game."
2002106645,527369,2018/6/26,0,When do the eggs go in?
2002206782,527369,2018/7/3,0,So I've gotten to mixing the wet and dry ingredients (not to butter yet) and I've got batter not dough. 1.3334 cups flour to 1.75 cups milk? Is that right?
1953043,503883,2013/8/18,4,"I used Frank&#039;s RedHot Sweet Chili Sauce because that&#039;s what we had on hand.  We cooked the chicken for 4 hours on high, and added a touch of ketchup and ginger as well.  The flavor was good, but the chicken was more of a shredded texture.  Easy weeknight meal!"
1783373,496953,2014/4/8,5,"I love this kind of dish - olive oil, garlic, bacon, lemon, YUM!  Can&#039;t go wrong with these flavors that carry notes of the Mediterranean.  I used extra garlic (because I just LOVE garlic) and also used a good quality extra virgin olive oil.  Also, I drained off most of the bacon fat and only left enough for taste. I added the garlic towards the end part when cooking the potatoes in the skillet, because I feared it would have burned.  Very tasty, tasty, and this dish will become a regular part of my cooking repertoire.  My family and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Made it for PAC 2014.  Thank you Motley Oklahoma for sharing this WINNER!"
1436160,496953,2014/11/21,5,"We just loved this dish.  It has all my favorites in it - green beans, potatoes, bacon, garlic... My red potatoes were on the large size so I cut them up before cooking them. I will definitely be making this again."
128473,510687,2015/1/8,5,We really enjoyed this quick and easy to make dish Doug.  It was so good and was even better the next day.  Thank you for sharing a new family favorite.  I did add a little more of the  red pepper flakes (personal preference only).  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Made FYC tag game 2015.
67728,513306,2014/4/29,5,"Didnt have any immediate solid plans for this, but I just like to keep pesto on hand. This version is so fresh tasting, and such a vibrant green (not like the dark green storebought pesto). I have a homemade pizza night happening soon, so I&#039;m sure that I&#039;ll be using some of this there, as well as in pasta dishes and chicken salad (my two favorite places for pesto to be). Thanks for posting, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be making this again in the future! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1800610886,508667,2013/12/10,5,I can&#039;t believe this recipe hasn&#039;t been reviewed sooner! It is simple to make and so delicious. Some might think the ingredients don&#039;t go together but they do! They work really well together. A taste explosion!
2000163216,534062,2018/2/22,0,When I look at the seasonings portion it seems a bit high to other recipes I've seen. Is it really 2 Tablespoon of onion powder and garlic powder?? When I want to make a large batch and multiply by 4 it comes out to 1/2 cup of each. Others of seen only call for teaspoons.
1803166895,505731,2014/9/24,0,i remeber those good old school days with good old chocolate  splodge.yummmm
2001968308,505731,2018/2/2,0,Glad this is posted just found after I posted on Facebook how much I loved this pudding. Will now make &amp; will let you know if it stirs up memories of school days. X
1803060670,517863,2014/8/22,5,&quot;Tasty little treats ! Bacon Babe never ceases to Amaze another Bacon Delight!!! Love it
204024,537175,2018/11/22,5,"Loved these warm delicious rolls. So easy to make and such a quick turnaround. To quote my son in law &quot;I like 'em&quot;, DH loved baking them in the skillet."
583193,492833,2013/1/7,4,This is good.  I am doing a lower carb diet but still need my sugar fix and this was a great way to get the fix.  You do need to heat the leftovers or it's not the same.
1803022859,517863,2014/8/12,5,Great flavors &amp; textures!
6789562,517863,2014/8/27,5,A culinary delight!!  A MUST for any party!  They were a smash at our summer bash!!
2651564,517863,2014/8/29,5,Delicious recipe! Making this tonight!
12485961,517863,2014/9/2,5,Yum!!!!
1803099321,517863,2014/9/2,5,They were great and very easy to make. Big hit at the party!!!
1803099370,517863,2014/9/2,5,Yummy!
1803099751,517863,2014/9/3,5,These burger bites shout DELICIOUS!  I made them last week....everyone loved them!  The polenta put them over the top!
347422,517863,2014/9/3,5,Perfect size for everyone and so delicious!
2067104,517863,2014/9/4,5,It&#039;s like love on a polenta square!
914360,517863,2014/9/4,5,"Five stars baby ! A-1 and a 2 and a 3, 4,5 ! Love the flavors !"
1803103910,517863,2014/9/4,5,Goat cheese in the polenta!  Yum!
1803104914,517863,2014/9/4,5,Best appetizers ever! Love the polenta cakes idea instead of regular buns.
1803105133,517863,2014/9/5,5,As always EXCELLENT !!!
1803105296,517863,2014/9/5,5,I tried this and it was so good I couldn&#039;t believe it.
1803073240,517863,2014/9/5,5,Fab!
1803106341,517863,2014/9/5,5,Burgers are totally my thing! Made them last night and was thrilled at how easy and delicious they were!
2196137,517863,2014/9/6,0,I LOVE this creative idea...I cant wait to serve this at my next party!
992432,517863,2014/9/7,5,These perfect bites these are an A+! Jodi does it again!
1803120826,517863,2014/9/9,5,Yum!

1803121079,517863,2014/9/10,5,Omg! I made this for my family and they loved it!! I will keep this recipe for years to come. Thank you sooooo much!!
1803121112,517863,2014/9/10,5,Fantastic! My friend and I loved this! I will totally make this again.
1803121141,517863,2014/9/10,5,Jodi has the most amazing recipes!
7066243,517863,2014/9/10,0,Superb.........jodi sure has talent.  Better than anything I have ever eaten at any restaurant in town.   A sure winner this jodi girl
2211242,517863,2014/9/11,5,delicious bite
1803125222,517863,2014/9/11,5,Perfect size!
851734,517863,2014/9/12,5,What is better than a bacon cheeseburger you can eat in one bite?  The tang you get from the A1 sauce works nicely with the cheddar cheese.  These are a must have at any party.  The guests will love them.
1803137328,517863,2014/9/15,5,Ain&#039;t nothing better than a burger! My fishing buddies and I just loved these!
1803138115,517863,2014/9/15,5,"Always looking for yummy party food, Bacon Babe nails it with an easy to make, sure to please, recipe. I have always liked the kick off A-1 and this recipe highlights the unique flavor brilliantly."
1803138186,517863,2014/9/15,0,Delicious!
1617352,517863,2014/9/15,5,Incredible Flavor!
1803138669,517863,2014/9/15,5,These are pretty damn awesome. The combination of the goat cheese and the A1 work so well together!
1803138691,517863,2014/9/15,5,So tasty - a total crowd pleaser
1803139268,517863,2014/9/15,5,I made these for my mah jongg club gals..went to get the camera to take a photo and the burger bites were all gone!  The A1 sauce was the kicker with the girls..they kept asking for the recipe.  I used cheddar and swiss cheeses..next time bleu cheese!  Delicious and versatile burgers!
1803140663,517863,2014/9/16,5,"I generally find polenta a dry, bland side. However, the A1b bacon burgers are anything but. Tasty, tender, tangy!"
2424289,517863,2016/7/2,5,Great recipe! Polenta cakes and burgers compliment each other well. These will definitely be in our rotation.
226867,507467,2013/10/30,5,I made these in the broiler (it was 32 degrees and snowing); they were great! Can&#039;t wait til it&#039;s grilling weather again!!
865936,507467,2013/10/31,5,"Very similar to the Spanish Patatas Bravas.  Easy, rustic, and good."
1052873,510194,2014/5/4,5,"This was fabulous! I had a terrible time with my mango, so it ended up with mango shreds and mango juice. After I made as directed, I added a little minced ginger from a jar to my bowl of it and it was even better! Made for PAC 14."
2001403281,525633,2017/2/23,4,"I loved Pada Express' Eggplant Tofu when I lived in CA but even there it seemed like one of their less popular entrees and after nearly 10 years of living in GA, I'm yet to find it offered at a single restaurant. This recipe came very close. The picture doesn't match the recipe as it is missing the red bell pepper which, along with the purple skin of the eggplant, Chilli paste and green onion, makes for a beautiful dish. As for the flavor it was excellent. One must adhere to the direction to add the cornstarch S L O W L Y at the end; I dumped in the whole tablespoon in my first attempt and got a lumpy mess. Luckily, the marinade was easy to remix so I did it again adding the corstarch very slowly and it came out great. My only reason for giving it 4-star instead of 5 is because it doesn't quite taste like the Panda Express version but, in honesty, I did make it gluten free by changing the soy sauce to a soy sauce substitute. My family all liked it but thought I should increase the sauce level which would be simple to do as it is prepared independently of the other items before being mixed at the end."
2001682288,525633,2017/8/22,3,"The 3 stars are more a commentary on my lack of skill and patience. I'll do it again and follow the recipe more closely. I love this dish as Panda Express makes it but it's hard to find in my area of California in the Central Valley. As a result, I've almost stopped going there. In the future I think I'll add just a tad bit more sugar, double the red bell pepper, use a little less oil. Thank you for putting it out there. You have no idea how much I've missed this dish!"
2001794936,525633,2017/11/14,4,I think doubling the sauce of the basic recipe is the way to go here.
2002162663,525633,2018/5/24,4,"Used 2 T pur&eacute;ed chipotle in adobe sauce instead of chili sace (what I had), and chili oil. Skipped sugar, didn’t have cooking sherry, added a small inion that I saut&eacute;ed with the pepper. Came out spicy and tasty! Will do again (but less heat as my daughter found it too spicy)."
1202184,503501,2014/12/2,1,I followed this recipe exactly and it did not work.  The cookie dough never chilled enough to be rolled properly - with or without flour on the surface.  I tried making them as drop cookies and they just spread out and stuck to the pan.  The cookie &quot;parts&quot; that I was able to save tasted very greasy.
1803605216,520282,2015/1/3,5,Made this recipe tonight. It was so delicious. The chicken was tender and full of flavor. I will make this again. I have made many recipes from this website and all the recipes have turned out great. Thank you for posting so many wonderful recipes. Keep them coming.
1803650388,520282,2015/2/8,5,This Chicken was like a restaurant!
226867,527559,2016/7/25,4,"Very yummy, I just don't know why the gelatin was needed. Also, wasn't sure what to do the lemon zest and lemon juice so just added to strawberries. Port reduction got a little over reduced (electric stove or my ineptitude??) but added a nice citrusy note! Thanks for posting! CQ2016 IHPi"
2002053349,519383,2018/3/15,5,"WONDERFUL!!!! Your so right they are delicious, flaky, and light! Your added directions were a true guidance. Thank you so much for posting!"
285039,499497,2013/5/19,5,"Excellent meal on its own or side dish for steak.   Next time I think I would cut the cheese quantity in half, but these were definitely yummy!"
2002162063,535784,2018/6/15,0,"What can you substitute for 'corn muffin mix'? Nothing like that here in Scotland, even at our quirky Mexican-American deli Lupe Pintos. Would it just be the dry ingredients for corn bread? If so, how much (preferably in weight) is a 'mix'?"
2002194217,535784,2018/6/22,0,"Corn muffin mix is basically Jiffy corn muffin mix. It is the sweeter corn bread mix from the southern part of the US, not really the Mexican-American part."
599450,503274,2013/8/3,5,"Another of Dienia&#039;s great recipes! The brown side of mine are rolled inside and the outside I made more blonde because I like them this way. I filled them with blueberry preserves and powdered sugar. Love how the instructions are written! Yes, I greased the pan well and used butter, too! These are just wonderful! Thanks, Dienia! Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
2001362355,511526,2017/7/14,4,I did less salt and pepper because I used garlic salt and ended up adding more sweet barbecue sauce to the mixture since I was serving on buns as a Sloppy Joe. Used 80/20 ground beef like recommended but I prefer ground turkey so may make with ground turkey next time.
126440,522311,2015/6/20,5,Excellent slaw.  Made half a recipe for the two of us.  Served with Pork Kabobs with BBQ sauce.
895132,495388,2013/4/18,5,"Had this with mixed vegetables and rice and loved it! I used fresh ginger and whole cumin seeds but dried chili. Very easy to make, but so tasty. Thanks for posting this recipe!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2013"
2002221656,534998,2018/7/18,0,"I have a BAD habit of getting the gist of something and doing my own thing. I'm going to make this tonight, exactly according to the recipe and will report back. This will be my first review of ANYTHING ever. Hope it goes well.------ Ok so I chose this based off the ingredients. Something simple my bf could make. Big mistake. He's in the kitchen and calls me in saying, &quot;what am I supposed to do?&quot; Um, it's a recipe, read and follow it I say back. Long story shorter, no clear instructions. We didn't know if the seasoning went on the chicken raw so we just seasoned it like normal. Then it says to add sauce, beans, and paste to the chicken. What sauce? We add the milk because well, it's an ingredient. Where does the cornstarch go? Not looking good at all, we figure the cheese will definitely save it. It barely did anything but help with the color. So while he's cooking, I can't take my eyes off the ingredient list. I think, this bottom half looks like a gravy. Maybe that's the sauce, but didn't say how to put it together being that you're supposed to mix the starch with water before adding to hot soups and sauces, there was no water in the ingredient list. It's too late at this point anyway. It has 1 1/2 c of milk twice. Where does that go? Overall, it has really good potential to be a great meal. Kind of sucks because I wanted to stick to a recipe and the first one I actually decide to review was incomplete. I am going to try this again but of course there will be tweaks. Not to the ingredients themselves, but to the assembly of it. I will post in the tweaks what I plan to do."
2001446111,530170,2017/3/20,1,"Love the idea, the photos, the printables....but...this recipe can not be correct. I just attempted it and either the ratios are incorrect or I'm seriously inept. Followed this to the letter, and I've used xanthan gum for years in many food applications. It seems the amount of xanthan gum is very high. If this recipe as is actually yielded that soft, supple looking gum in the photos Id be surprised."
80353,503854,2013/7/14,5,Yummy!  Yummy!!  We love haloumi in any form and this was very nice indeed.  Especially loved the little jolts of heat provided by the fresh chili (not so common here).
220348,503854,2013/7/24,5,"I&#039;ve always wanted to know what Haloumi cheese tasted like, and now that I know, I enjoy it very much. I never had cheese of any kind fried, but with everything else that went along with it, it was really good. Since it is a mild cheese, it went well with the chilies."
480195,503854,2013/9/7,5,"I prepared these little slices of heaven and served them on crostini, minus the lettuce. Just wonderful! This makes a wonderful appetizer. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
2002314106,523450,2018/10/27,1,"Made this tonite. Very disappointed. Looked good but tasted bland. My husband thought something was missing, like sherry!"
2399085,508781,2013/11/8,3,It was ok... It did not meet what I had expected. Thanks anyways
653438,508781,2013/11/12,5,"Made this for the Cook-a-thon  in Memory of Pammyowl and DH and I enjoyed it for our lunch down at the beach.  I did cut the recipe in half, used homemade chicken broth and fresh mushrooms (which I sauteed with the onions, peppers and celery).   A quick and easy dish to prepare when you are in a hurry.  Oh yes, I used wild rice which I had made previously and froze."
8629,512051,2014/1/18,5,This stew makes the whole house smell wonderful while it cooks.   I added about 2 chopped cloves of garlic in Step 5. The cooking time was spot on.  All of the vegetables and the stew meat were very tender after 2 1/2 hours of cooking on the stove top.
266635,515427,2014/4/27,4,"This is a nice way to cook a spiral ham.  I used the low setting on my slow cooker and made as directed.  Served my ham with baked sweet potatoes and a red cabbage dish.  Made for PRMR, April, 2014."
2002222700,505732,2018/7/19,5,"I used to work at Jimmy John's. This recipe is close, but you need to do a full cup of mayo, not a 1/2 cup if you want it to be exact."
1802808979,505732,2014/6/9,1,"Love Jimmy John&#039;s tuna and was surprised to see soy sauce as an ingredient - thought maybe that WAS the secret ingredient that made it so different than what I can make at home... and maybe it is, but NOT in this amount.  If you put 1/4 cup in it will totally overpower the tuna AND turn it brown.  It looks nothing like the JJ tuna.  I am going to try again with maybe a teaspoon of soy sauce, but nowhere close to 1/4 a cup."
2000138831,505732,2015/4/13,4,"VERY close to Jimmy Johns recipe. Used to be a manager at a Jimmy Johns and this is almost perfect. A few things, squeeze out all the water from the tuna, add the soy to the TUNA ONLY and mix that around (yes it is supposed to be brown) then add the veggies and mayo and mix it all up. I just made it for my family for the first time who have never had Jimmy Johns and although I didn&#039;t use enough tuna (I&#039;m bad at math) they absolutely LOVE it."
2000352106,505732,2015/7/20,5,"Yes the soy is the key ingredient, and you are right it is nowhere near 1/4 cup. I shook the bottle three or five times over the tuna then added my other ingredients. So long jimmy johns won&#039;t be going back they never give me enough tuna on my sandwich."
2000857880,505732,2016/2/5,3,"I could have sworn that there was cucumber in JJ&#039;S tuna. Either way, this is close but that is WAY too much soy sauce."
2000880113,505732,2016/2/18,0,I changed the serving size to 1 and the soy sauce changed to 1/16 c which is 1 T and that was way too much. Made for and unpleasant result. Next time I will put less before I dismiss making this myself altogether.
2001184813,505732,2016/9/26,4,"It calls for SIX (6) cans of tuna, so it's obvious the other reviewers didn't read the recipe properly. I used 1 can of tuna and 2 shakes of the soy sauce bottle. This was so good and very, very close to JJ's."
45232437,505732,2017/5/3,5,"This was the best tuna salad I've ever made! And yes, it IS better with less soy sauce. I halved the soy sauce, used slightly less onion and celery, and slightly more mayo. I also followed the suggestion of mixing the tuna and soy sauce together first. The half batch I made (perfect for the 2 of us) used the following amounts: 3 cans of tuna, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1/4 cup white onion, 1/4 cup celery, and 1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp mayonnaise."
174706,512343,2014/7/5,5,"My family really loved this - simple and good comfort food.  I had leftover spaghetti, threw in some ham I had from the freezer and a cup of Mexican blend shredded cheese and it was great.  I did throw in some raw onion, and that didn&#039;t really cook during the oven time.  Next time, I would saute it a little first.  I ended up heating it for about 25 minutes to get it hot, too.  The 3 cups of milk seemed like a lot and that it would be soupy, but it wasn&#039;t at all - just the right amount of creaminess."
1676220,494482,2013/9/30,5,WOW this is a really good quick recipe.  I have made this several times now and what a great fresh way to have a small portion of apple cake!  I make exactly as directed and I use a chunky applesauce! Its great with a little ice cream or whip cream!!  Thanks for the recipe!!
2000722990,524516,2015/12/9,5,I tried these at a potluck and they were delicious.
1670583,524516,2015/12/10,4,Delicious! And they were surprisingly easy to make. I will make these again.
2630294,495777,2013/3/25,5,Super Easy and very good!
452355,502993,2013/8/21,5,"Excellent tuna skewers!  We loved the flavorful chermoula.  DH, who made dinner, did reduce the amount of lemon juice, per personal taste and because we were serving it over a lemony couscous, Recipe #505110.  We would have these tuna skewers again.  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT9."
440735,502993,2013/8/22,5,Wow and Wow! We loved this! The only thing I would change would be to decrease the lemon juice to allow more of the other flavors to come through. Next time I will cook a tuna steak and thinly slice it before serving.  Made for ZWT for the Gourment Goddesses July 2013.
895132,493360,2014/1/13,5,"Yum! Loved this salad. It&#039;s really crunchy and refreshing, even better the next day. Will make this again. Thanks for another keeper, dear Pam :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for the Cook-A-Thon in memory of Pam"
350938,519216,2014/10/30,5,What a great tasting salad dressing this is. I also used some of this to marinate chicken thighs and they were divine!! I made mine with crunchy peanut butter which worked perfectly.
204024,519216,2015/7/21,5,This recipe has a wonderful flavor.  I made this for a salad potluck at work and it was really enjoyed but I am going to try it as a marinade.  That sounds really good also.  Made for For Your Consideration.
37449,505777,2013/8/20,5,Easy and so tasty for a quick snack. I cut the recipe back and wished I had made more. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by a member of team Hot Stuff.

498271,509739,2013/12/27,5,"This is a great tasty cheeseball!  I didn&#039;t want the broccoli to be raw so I sauteed it just a bit with the bacon before adding it to the cheese.  I also took your suggestion and mixed the bacon in with the cheese, then rolled the mixture in chopped parsley before serving.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!"

354675,513963,2014/3/4,5,"Mandy! You genius. I get all the flavors and satisfaction of a key lime pie, but with only a quarter of the work and time spent. I actually like this version better - the salty hit you get from the crackers is right up my alley. Thanks so much for posting!"
1802391549,513963,2014/3/4,5,"I will never look at Ritz Crackers the same way again, thanks to this recipe. I love the sweet-tart-salty flavor combo AND it&#039;s super easy to make. Thanks, Mandy!"
2815640,513963,2014/3/4,5,"Wow! My dad is a huge key lime pie guy and makes them often. But who has all that time? This is my go-to when I&#039;m craving that refreshingly sweet bite but don&#039;t want to put in all the effort. Well done, Mandy!"
2752091,513963,2014/3/4,5,"Thank you, Mandy! In the past I designated Key Lime Pie as a &quot;weekend only&quot; dessert due to time limitations. I love that I can have the flavor of one of my favorite pies in just 10 minutes. Great idea!"
1802555155,513963,2014/3/5,5,WHOA. Did not expect this to be SO DELICIOUS considering how easy it was to make! Great recipe.
2001047423,535783,2018/6/3,4,"I didn't use steak as I don't eat mammals, but it didn't make these any more fiddly to make. Only some of each onion can be used, less than half of each if you want uniform sizes (not everyone does). Then onion rings are flexible, so &quot;wedging in&quot; pieces meant that some fell out, cheese included, before, during &amp; after breading, which was why it was fiddly. Only 8oz of steak/chicken does not serve 4, not as a meal anyway &amp; it seems an awful lot of trouble to go to just to eat with sauce. The picture of a greasy, oozy crumby squashed cake was off-putting, just put the sauce on a plate &amp; use a knife/fork, I can't understand why the sauce would be put in a pot, I couldn't do that in public. I doubled the recipe for 3-4, the flavours are lovely, the Provolone held things together well (apart from the messy butterfingers mishaps), I fried the rest of the onions with them &amp; served with salad &amp; crusty bread. I like the flavours together, next time I will try a 'base' of chilled mashed potato to set the onion ring in &amp; add the chicken/cheese in the middle. When I showed my children the recipe, they said 'tomato sauce' is Bolognese sauce', oh! Tomato Sauce in the UK is Ketchup, lol, never mind, they go with either. I also made Tom P's suggestion, a Ranch dressing &amp; wholegrain Dijon mix, they go well with this too. I felt that it was too 'cheffy' as is, not easy to make, &amp; I'm not a beginner, otherwise I'd give another star."
2000376924,535783,2018/6/22,2,"I really thought these would be a surprise delight but as it turned out, sometimes you can just go too far. Deep frying this made the beef less flavorful and the overall effect was just too much grease. I served it with a side of spicy mayo and my wife and SIL said they liked it but for me... well, it was really just inedible. I wanted to like this, honestly I did, but not for me, I guess."
1718022,495171,2013/3/28,5,"My fussy family loved this recipe, I modified by omitting the mushrooms and olives.  Used mini turkey pepperoni and omitted the salt and pepper.  It was a favorite and was quick to whip up on a school night.  Could even make pasta ahead of time."
135470,503902,2013/8/24,2,"This was a difficult recipe to review. The salmon is good, and unless you overcook it, in our book any grilled salmon is a 4 star or more recipe.  For the noodles, I followed the directions on the package and soaked them first and had to cook them longer than stated here. There is no where in the recipe about what to do with the curry and turmeric and oil with the noodles. So you cook them together? They were fine. The sauce was terrible. It warm bland coconut milk with a taste of ginger and what ends up to be barely cooked peppers and corn. I ended up straining our the veggies, and saut&eacute;ed them separately, then used the coconut milk to make a peanut sauce."
169430,504293,2013/8/18,5,"I&#039;ve been intending to make up a batch of this for some time and when better that now! It&#039;s certainly easy to make with ingredients I always have at hand and packs a flavor punch. I&#039;ve used Chermoula on fish, chicken and veggies in the past and it&#039;s always been well enjoyed."
480195,504293,2013/8/25,5,Very good flavor! I used it on red snapper and it was enjoyed by all. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

80353,501807,2013/8/23,5,"Being a family of iced-tea lovers, this didn&#039;t last very long in our home (especially thanks to son #2 who drank most of it all by himself!).  I used Darjeeling.  I felt the flavours of the lemongrass and ginger really did make this a &#039;cut above&#039; regular iced tea.  Good instructions.  We sweetened a bit with sugar."
296809,501807,2013/8/25,5,"Made for the Goddesses of ZWT-9, this tea is excellent. All of the ingredient elements work seamlessly to make the outcome flavorful &amp; refreshing. I did add fresh mint from my SIL&#039;s garden because I favor it so much. To be truthful, I am not at all sure what kind of tea I used, but I do know it was authentic Chinese tea brought to me by my DH&#039;s father who spent 3 wks in China as part of a tour grp (See container &amp; dried tea in pic). He will be pleased to know that I put some of it to such good use. Thx for sharing your recipe w/me."
17803,501807,2013/8/26,4,"I had bought some lemongrass at the Des Moines Farmers Market last year.  The lady told me to clean it and freeze it, and it would keep (vacuum sealed).  So I&#039;ve been using it as needed and it still has a nice flavor.  I only used maybe a tablespoon of sugar as I don&#039;t like sweet tea.  But that was still enough to make the tea sweet.  Made for team Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9 2013"
1925885,501807,2013/8/29,5,"Loved this tea!!!  I was at my Mom&#039;s when I made this and only had use of a microwave, but an overnight steeping of ginger and lemongrass must have done the trick!  I will definitely make this again - over and over considering the abundance of lemongrass growing along my driveway! Made for ZWT9 - Gourmet Goddesses."

1052873,501807,2013/8/29,5,This was very tasty. I made 1/4 recipe for one glass. I overcooked the sugar syrup so it was like taffy but I just warmed it up and put it in the iced tea. Made for ZWT9.

266635,506514,2013/9/19,5,"My kind of salad!  Loved this salad -- it&#039;s hard not to since it has all the ingredients that I love.  If you&#039;ve never tried gorgonzola or blue cheese with fruit and greens, you are missing out on a wonderful experience.  I was going to make this as a side salad, but decided to just have a salad fest for lunch and it was sooo delish!  Made for PRMR, September, 2013."
381180,506514,2013/9/20,3,"Good with potential, but for me, the dressing ingredients needed to be more specific!  I toasted my pecans, used Braeburn apples, and Gorgonzola.  Made for Fall Rookie Recipe Tag ~ due 09/20."
560491,506514,2013/10/4,5,"Great salad!  I made a single serving for lunch today, but the full amount of dressing so I can make it again.  The only thing I measured out were the dressing ingredients; I just sprinkled the salad ingredients over some green leaf lettuce.  The dressing was not sweet, but mixed with the apples it was perfect.  I used candied pecans I bought at Trader Joes but otherwise the ingredients listed.  Will be making this again!  Made for PRMR."
128473,504660,2014/2/16,5,"Thank you for sharing your recipe my friend.  The crepes were awesome, quick  and easy to make, with ingredients always found in the pantry and fridge.  I love crepes and these babies do not disappoint.  They were perfect, simply perfect.  Carlin &amp; I enjoyed them for lunch on the weekend.  Garnished and filled with whipped cream and strawberries. She said, nana, you are the best cook.  All the credit goes to your wonderful recipe.  Thanks for making me shine, in my granddaughters eyes.  I will be making these often.  She has already asked if we can have these again, at our next sleepover."
461834,504660,2014/9/19,5,"So quick and easy!!  I always thought that crepes were hard to make and this recipe is very easy!!!  I made this for my lunch, filling them with some semi-sweet chocolate chips and topping with fresh sliced strawberries and whipped cream, yummy!!!  I served them with a side of sausage links for a filling delicious lunch!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe and congrats on your win in the FB Pool!!"
37636,504660,2015/1/10,5,Recipe works great and  taste is spot on. I&#039;d allow more time to make these though unless you use more than one pan. I topped mine with lingonberry butter and powdered sugar. Thanks for sharing!
47892,504660,2015/1/18,4,These crepes were easy to prepare and tasty. It would help if the directions stated the yield and how much batter to pour. Absolutely delicious topped with this: Recipe #491196 and a microscopic sprinkle of ground cardamom. Made for Best of 2014.
679953,506178,2013/9/9,5,"I never in my wildest dreams would use spam in meatloaf.  Well, now I stand corrected ! !  Boy was this ever good.  Definately something to try again.  I did use 1/8 ketchup, and 1/8 cup Hickory BBQ sauce.  Other than that made right down the line.  TRULY a GEM. Made for PRMR Tag."
2597942,506178,2013/10/7,5,"I made this a few weeks ago and forgot to post my review. Well this was certainly different from the normal meatloaf that I make. What a nice change of pace. The little bits of pineapple inside gave a unique flavor to the loaf. The only trouble I had with this recipe is that it did not stay in a loaf shape very well before or after baking. It basically fell apart when I moved it to the serving platter. I think it may be because of too much juice. The pineapple itself holds a lot of juice, so next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I will probably drain the can of crushed pineapple before adding it to the meat. I also had a can of pineapple chunks that I added to the top during the last several minutes of baking (just to show what the flavor would be, and to hide the cracks). The Spam is quite clever... who dreams this stuff up?! Thank you for posting. (Made for New Kids on the Block tag)"

266635,509254,2014/12/2,5,These sandwiches made a perfect lunch today.  We used our leftover turkey from Thanksgiving  and the dressing was yummy.

107135,504815,2013/8/6,5,this was very nice omelet  mr picky was happy fellow  zwt9
610488,504815,2013/8/7,4,Really tasty. A little thicker and denser than a standard omelet but still good.
461834,504815,2013/9/5,5,"I know this is called a cake, but to me, it is an omelet and I just got a new mini omelet pan, so I had to try it out with this recipe.  The directions don&#039;t include when to add the flour, but I just added the 1/2 &amp; 1/2 to the flour to make a slurry, then added it to the egg mixture.  I made 1/3 of the recipe and followed it until I reached about the 10 minute cook time, then I flipped it over for about 2 more minutes and it was done to perfection!!  I served it with some fresh fruit and a potato au gratin recipe for a wonderful brunch!!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
1419314,518537,2016/8/26,5,"This is an original flavor packed dish. A really nice change from pasta and your typical meat-based entrees. I admit I wasn't trying it for the gluten-free or paleo aspects. I did add a little cheese to the mixture (shredded truffle cheese to be exact), and put toasted bread crumbs on top as it baked. So I know that added to the flavor, for my taste anyway, but the combination of spices coating the cauliflower really stole the show. The bacon and chicken and veggies are a killer combination. Of note: there is nothing to bind this casserole dish together, because it doesn't have your typical cream or cheese based additions. So it remains a bundle of ingredients that sort of fall apart on your dish, but forking them all together for a delicious bite is a real treat!"
2001052525,497775,2016/6/16,5,This recipe was Spot On!! I did not change a thing and it was Delicious!!
2001228368,497775,2017/4/15,0,Absolutely awful directions. When butter stops bubbling it's brown. Ingredients did not incorporate and nowhere were there instructions to add the mushrooms. I ended up ditching the sauce before I wasted my crawfish in it. Back to searching for a better crawfish pasta recipe.
2001691154,497775,2017/10/28,5,"OMG delicious. Being a Yankee (and pretty &quot;meh&quot; about seafood anyway), crawfish isn't easy to find locally, so I substituted Andouille sausage. (Shrimp would probably work well here too.) Velveeta grosses me out so I subbed in about 2 ounces Organic Valley processed American cheese. Other than that followed the recipe. Thanks for sharing! Oh, almost forgot, didn't have mushrooms on hand so I added a diced red bell pepper this time. Really tasty."
37449,514140,2014/3/18,5,"Easy and yummy. I actually made a creamy sriracha dressing with mayonnaise, even though I know the ranch dressing would be great with it."
2001355273,497775,2018/3/14,2,"This idea is wonderful but ingredient amounts don’t make sense. 2 sticks of butter (1/2 lb) to 1 T. Flour does not make a roux. 1/2 C (1 stick) might work. And sorry but, Velveeta? Really? I might try this with some Real Cheese sometime."
2002193516,497775,2018/6/21,5,I have made the recipe before and it is super yummy! This time I am using 1 lb of crawfish and 1 lb of salad shrimp &amp; queso blanco with jalapeno.
1249468,511805,2014/2/9,5,"I made this broth last week. Frankly, I was worried I would have another cabbage diet soup on my hands (yuck!) However, for a basic veggie broth, this stuff tastes really, really good! The ginger is key for best flavor, I added a bit more garlic and used a beet for my root veggie, I felt it gave it a more beef-broth look and feel. I could drink this all day - really! Don&#039;t feel bad about tossing the colorless mush left over. It has little nutrients left in it and besides, it&#039;s what compost bins crave. Thanks for posting!"
128473,493438,2013/7/17,5,"Wow, another winner by Dienia B.  I really enjoyed this cool and refreshing salad. It was the perfect accompaniment to the BBQ burgers we had for dinner.

Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for ZWT9."
496803,493438,2013/7/18,5,"This is a great salad to take to a BBQ, especially when you don&#039;t want to worry about food going bad in the heat.  I love the combination of feta and melon, the play of salty with sweet really makes this special.  Made for ZWT9"
204024,493438,2013/7/26,5,"This made a colorful side to our Mediterranean supper tonight, a nice match to the lamb dish in both color and flavor. We have another favorite watermelon salad using ginger, cilantro and lime; this is of the same general character but the mint and feta takes it in a different direction. Could be served as an appetizer, side, or dessert and nobody would question it.  Made for Zaar World Tour 9."

447487,493438,2013/7/26,5,"I made this salad a couple of days ago, first bowl was nice and refreshing though somewhat bland, leftovers sat for 2 days in the dressing.

Made during ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers :)"
169430,493438,2013/8/29,5,A wonderful tasting and cooling element to last night&#039;s dinner. This is another of those recipes that are more than the sum of it&#039;s parts. IF you have any left over it&#039;s makes a nice summer breakfast too :wink:.
498271,493438,2013/9/4,5,"This is a delicious fruit salad!  Loved the dressing and the addition of the walnuts.

After being fried, made the dessert even better having it all in one package. One side note: Jam is extremely hot and I have a strip of peeling skin on the roof of my mouth to testify to this fact."

2001951155,525677,2018/1/24,1,"I just made this dish last weekend for the family. No one liked it, including me. The lime juice gives the entire dish an off putting sour taste. I might make it again, but without any limes and/or lime juice, and I would increase the honey to 1 tablespoon."
865936,503802,2013/10/10,5,"I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce.  The apricot jam and the flavor of the sherry really stood out in a good way.  I cooked both ripe bananas and ripe plantains with the sauce.  When I say ripe, I mean the bananas were almost mushy.  Consequently, they almost flattened when baking.  The plantains fared much better.  They were a shorter, rounder variety and held their shape very nicely.  Also be careful not to leave it in the oven too long because the sauce will soon become hard and stick to the pan.  Made for PHOTO TAG."
1802384129,501987,2014/1/20,0,I am lucky enough to have eaten this at Stephenson&#039;s.... and luckier to have married one of their cooks (he worked there though college). This IS the recipe. It is wonderful. I substitute with real milk- because I just prefer working with real ingredients as much as possible. I have made it with chicken breasts exclusively and it works out in less cooking time. Working on making it GF since gluten is now out of my diet.
1802947026,501987,2014/10/15,5,This is one of my favorite recipes. I substitute cream for the powdered milk and water.&lt;br/&gt;Delicious
2000466939,501987,2017/1/11,5,Wonderful chicken recipe! I too have eaten at Stephensons several times and am sorry they are no longer there.
1110280,494037,2013/1/26,5,We absolutely loved this. It tasted real similar to the filling for twice baked potatoes. Will definetly make this again.
2001761449,492885,2017/10/22,5,Wow imagine my surprise when I googled this recipe as I was trying to share it with my hair stylist and see my Mother in laws name Indabelle along with the recipe! So cool ! Thanks for sharing and giving her the credit ! This recipe has quite a legacy attached as well as great family memories for us as well.
2001410644,522655,2017/8/11,5,"As Rick has indicated, I found this to be a very simple recipe. I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the condensed tomato soup, only because I was in the mood for a slightly less &quot;tomatoey&quot; taste at the time. It was delicious! The family loved it."
80353,504554,2013/7/31,5,"What a good idea to pour the hot oil on the onion to get rid of the &#039;raw&#039; taste - going to put that in my little book of tricks.  Having said that, this recipe is OMG delicious!  Even though I halved the recipe, I used the full amount of scotch bonnet asked for.  The mango takes this to a whole new level with the sweet element.  Served with pita chips.  Will have to make some more soon."
37449,504554,2013/8/5,5,Quartered the recipe and loved it with black beans and rice and tostones(fried plantain)! Fresh and different with the mango. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013.
174096,504554,2013/8/7,5,"A delightful guacamole variation!  The mango added such a nice sweet pop of flavor that balances nicely with the spiciness of the chili.  I had never used either the onion/oil technique or the mashing up of the chili and garlic into a paste for guac before, so those were interesting touches.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
266635,504554,2014/5/19,5,"Loved this guacamole.  The addition of the mango really gives this dish a wonderful pop of flavor.  The only changes I made was to use jalapeno vs. scotch bonnet and I didn&#039;t grind the pepper and garlic -- just added them to the mix of chopped onions, etc.  Also left the avocado chunky as well.  Will definitely make this again - thanks for posting this recipe.  Served this wonderful guacamole alongside and on top of some bean and corn tacos.  Made for PRMR, May, 2014."
461834,504554,2016/8/10,5,"Wow!! What a difference it makes by adding the mango!! This was really quite sweet with that added to the guacamole, aside from the hot pepper. What a fun change of flavors for eating chips and guacamole. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for Culinary Quest 2016."
1060667,504554,2016/10/20,5,"Delicious!! I made http://www.food.com/recipe/healthy-baked-corn-tortilla-chips-homemade-263512 to go along with it, perfect!!"

2063526,515791,2015/1/18,5,Delicious I had 3 or 4 leftover blackberries and I threw those in too. My only question is do we drink the whole blender cup?
482376,503085,2013/8/7,5,"This was a really yummy way to finish off the leftover Swedish meatballs I had in the fridge. I used homemade Swedish limpia bread as the base for this delicious open-faced sandwich. The beet relish/apple, etc... mixture was excellent! Thank you. Made for the Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9"
126440,502451,2013/8/3,5,Amazing sauce.  I used it for pork but could be used for any meat.  So easy to put together and ready in 30 min.  LOVE IT!
1331828,495705,2013/4/7,5,"Did not have ground chicken, but used ground turkey instead, and it was delicious!!  My husband and son  couldn&#039;t get enough.  They requested it again next week.  Need to buy more Frank&#039;s Hot Sauce!"
1609858,495705,2013/5/7,4,"This was good and had a genuine &quot;buffalo wing&quot; flavor to it.  The sauce was not too hot, thankfully, but I guess that would depend on the type of buffalo sauce you buy.  If we make again I think I would omit the blue cheese.  It wasn&#039;t overwhelming, but a little stronger than I like.  Maybe instead of blue cheese I would mix some Ranch Dressing Mix in the ricotta and then do a layer of Ranch dressing too.  I think I might enjoy that more.  Also my husband said he might prefer diced chicken instead of the ground, to really give it more chicken flavor.  I found this in the February/March issue of Taste of Home."
318262,495705,2013/9/8,5,my bf loved this - ours was very spicy but i think thats cause of the kind of sauce we used. Thanks for the recipe!
10810912,526118,2016/3/14,2,testing
1745502,500048,2013/5/21,5,Not too hard to make and yummy. A great new way to cook potatoes.
340141,500048,2013/6/3,5,"Incredible.   If using only two potatoes, you might want to put just a little less tumeric in it to avoid bitterness.   I made my filling only about 1/4-inch thick so the bitterness would be tempered by the surrounding dough and sauces.  The sauces are what make this dish; delicious.   Add a little spoonful of harissa to the side, and you&#039;re in food heaven."
239758,500048,2013/6/6,5,"Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow! What a sensational recipe. So easy to make and so delicious. I used the food processor the the potato mixture and the cilantro (coriander in Australia) sauce.  I used the full amount of turmeric. I wish I could give this 100 stars. It&#039;s certainly worthy of them. Thanks very much for posting."
1179225,500048,2015/10/5,5,Soooo good! I cut the eggroll wrappers in quarters and then used my pot sticker press to seal them. We loved these as is and the sauces gave them areal kick. Thanks for sharing this delicious keeper recipe.
2000498330,498886,2017/4/28,5,Delicious moist bread with slightly dense texture. Used regular cycle (my machine doesn't have sweet bread cycle) and turned out fine. Excellent toasted with a little butter.
2198132,495134,2013/2/11,5,"Yum, great idea and recipe!"
163112,503358,2013/8/16,5,"This was great!  There wasn&#039;t an any extra marinade to make sauce with.  Next time I&#039;ll use more tamarind, too.  My daughter, THE PICKY ONE, ate 2 helpings instantly.  Later, when she wanted a &#039;snack&#039;, she had a 3rd serving.  I&#039;ll definitely be making this again!  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
2189849,495134,2013/2/11,5,Wowsers this looks terrific.
2001918766,508734,2018/1/7,5,"Delicious! Just like mom used to make. I did need a little more water for consistency I prefer, but plopped these into chicken soup and YUM!!!"
2002018170,508734,2018/10/25,5,These are what my grandma made with her chicken paprikash. Thank you.
2000297852,517843,2015/7/22,5,"I was really skeptical about trying this...I couldn&#039;t wrap my mind around how this could be anything but a slimy mess. But I bucked up and tried it knowing I could always make banana bread if it was a failure. I was shocked at how ice-cream like the texture was once it quite suddenly blended together after shoving the banana mass  along in the processor a few times. Was very pleased and already thinking up ideas like a banana rum flavor, and maybe making a banana &quot;ice cream&quot; pie using an Oreo crumb crust."
2731384,496551,2013/3/10,5,Very good. Had it for brunch today.
2767670,496551,2013/4/3,0,Sounds good - I love a good quiche recipe.
2791643,496551,2013/4/19,5,Followed the instructions on timing and this quiche set up perfectly.  Next time I think I&#039;ll add some type of meat for the men in my life who eat quiche.
2393730,501431,2013/7/23,5,"I took this salad to a get together with friends and it was a hit with no left overs. We did not marinade the chicken as written because we didn&#039;t read the directions properly. But it still worked out. Be careful with the marinade/dressing as it is pretty strong and a little goes a long way. When it says dress lightly, PLEASE dress lightly taste and add more as needed. It&#039;s fairly easy to make and delicious."
266635,500139,2013/6/3,5,"This is a great Mexican-style burger!  Loved the avocado, pico de gallo,  the cilantro mayo and the Mexican seasonings  -- all are necessities for a great Tex-Mex burger.  The fried egg was a good addition; however, I would probably leave it out next time.  I had forgotten how much I love homemade burgers -- this recipe will definitely be on my go-to list.  Made for the PRMR tag, June, 2013."
169430,500139,2013/7/5,5,This burger is really filled with flavor. I didn&#039;t use the fried eggs but everything else went in. I must say that it very filling but you&#039;ll love every bite. I especially loved the avocado. Nwxt time I&#039;ll use a couple of tooth picks stuck in the finished burger as all that good stuff made it kind of hard to hold together (and don&#039;t forget the napkins). :D
266635,503720,2014/5/1,5,"Made these delicious kabobs tonight.  The marinade is really flavorful and it really makes the chicken breast moist and tender.  The only changes I made to the marinade was to use jalapeno pepper and I used coconut oil.  Served this chicken alongside a pasta salad.  Made for Spring PAC, May, 2014."
128473,503720,2014/5/9,5,"Bravo on a very nice jerk chicken recipe.  We enjoyed the chicken prepared this way.  It was so flavorful, sweet, hot and spicy.  Like my friend Nancy, I also used coconut oil.  Made exactly as written and used 3 scotch bonnet peppers.  There were so many flavors in this lovely jerk, every bite was different.  The chicken was perfectly grilled, crispy, moist and tender.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will make again and again. Served with beautiful crispy naan bread and lime/cilantro mayonnaise for lovely tropical sandwiches.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
2736860,496755,2013/3/14,5,"I just made this recipe last night, and loved it! The burnt butter sauce brings a great flavor to the potatoes, and it was an easy way for my daughter to eat her vegetables."
461834,499256,2013/5/8,5,"Very nice flavored skirt steak!!!  I think the addition of the garlic and onions really helped bring the flavor to this steak.  The fresh orange slices and beer really helped to tenderize this steak.  After marinating the steak, I took that sliced onions from the marinade and put them in a piece of heavy duty foil, that we added to the grill while cooking the steak, so good!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for &quot;Name that Ingredient&quot; Tag Game."
37449,506528,2013/10/3,5,"Yum! I enjoyed this slaw, and did add some cranberries to it also. This was different and very good with the mustard. Thanks! Made for My 3 Chefs event."
2001427407,530158,2017/4/25,5,"This was pretty good! Family loved it and I'll definitely make it again. I liked that it wasn't overly ricey. I served it with pepper jack cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Tweaks were - I used fire roasted tomatoes, canned corn (drained) with poblanos, some adobo seasoning I had on hand and I added half an onion and a chopped jalapeno during the second stage of cooking."
2001630635,530158,2017/7/17,5,My family loved this!!
107135,503861,2013/7/14,5,"1st off canned sweet potatoes  are you friend,just saying2nd i cut back on spices cause i feed mr picky nice filling breakfast for him.he liked syrup zwt9"
80353,503861,2013/7/18,5,"What a treat this was for breakfast.  Very sweet and immensely satisfying!  I did as Rachel suggested and used a whole egg rather than the 2 yolks, and it worked out just fine.  The recipe yields a LOT of pecan butter, which was just fine by my son as he used it the next day, too, on waffles. ;-)"
2000431901,503861,2017/11/9,5,So so SO good!
77458,502543,2013/7/10,5,I found this to be very tasty and really easy. This recipe will be a &quot;go to&quot; recipe for me! Thanks for posting!
37449,494190,2014/1/26,4,I enjoyed the sauce and the veggies! Next time I will try it with fake meat for a little chewier texture. Thanks Elise and Family!
2002190344,501760,2018/6/18,0,How many calories or WW points?
488441,495351,2013/3/4,4,"I liked the meat skewers and thought the cabbage patties were a good idea. The flavor of the patties just never came across. At first, I thought I must have left something out, but I didn't. The meat is good and the patties can be tweaked. Served this with toasted French bread drizzled with olive oil and artichoke tapenade."
171904,497345,2013/8/23,5,This tastes just like what friends of mine would make when I lived in NC! This was a tiny bit too thick the first time I made it so this time I cut down on the amount of slurry I added to the broth. One of these days I might actually make the &quot;slicks&quot; from scratch but for now I did exactly like most of the folks did and used frozen ones. Still a great recipe!
2463749,494491,2013/4/24,4,"Wonderful dish! I had to make a few substitutions for what I had on hand, but it turned out amazing. (I used regular onions and browned them with the ground beef, as I didn&#039;t have green onion. I also used ground ginger since I didn&#039;t have any fresh ginger). My husband loved it as did my 14 month old daughter. A definite repeat in our house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Since making this the first time, I&#039;ve done it again, incorporating fresh ginger into the recipe, as called for. I think that I may stick to the ground ginger, or just add a touch of fresh ginger, so it doesn&#039;t overpower the dish."
2878252,494491,2013/6/26,5,I know this dish. I found it on a different site last year. Isn&#039;t it great? My husband loves this dish. I end up making it several times a month.
136997,506488,2014/4/7,4,"We don&#039;t follow a Paleo diet, but this recipe sounded good. I chose to use fresh vegetables (minus the carrots) and subbed in a red pepper instead. Husband gave it a thumbs up. :)"
1926335,518413,2016/5/19,4,"These are pretty good, when I made them and took them out of the oven I said to myself, oh no I forgot the oil but there is no mention on oil in the recipe so I guess there is none. Great tasting muffin - thanks for the recipe."
2001470067,518413,2017/4/5,2,"Not a fan. Maybe more cinnamon, nutmeg and salt would help but I don't think I'll be trying this again."
1800157371,494491,2013/10/27,4,"Very tasty, was shocked somthing so simple would have such a great flavor! I reccomend diced green bellpeper however."
674022,494491,2014/6/10,5,This recipe comes from Lizzy writes or Six Sisters but either way it is delicious. I don&#039;t know Korean food or how authentically it matches the flavor but it is a pleasing plate. We doubled the recipe easily. The family oohed and awed even the pickiest of eaters had seconds. It is surprisingly simple and the few ingredients meld well. The green onions are key for the taste and color; don&#039;t skip them. This is a keeper and will go into our month rotation for sure. Thanks for posting it already Chris. It saved me time as it is already a family favorite. Enjoy! ChefDLH
2754389,494491,2016/8/13,5,"Spicy good dish! To get the ground beef to look more like slices of beef, I shaped it into a 2&quot; log, wrapped it in foil and partially froze, then sliced it off in thin, irregular pieces. Was surprised how well it held together when browning! I used dark brown sugar and cooked the sauce down to glaze the meat. Next time I will make extra sauce. Thanks for sharing, will make often."
2000904463,494491,2017/5/13,5,"Made as written, used 1/4 tsp ground cayenne, except I did not have sesame oil. The entire family loved it from 2 -40! Made a second side pan of sauce using lesser amounts of the peppers and adding some minced garlic. We used that to drizzle on steamed broccoli. Fabulous and my favorite part FAST! Will be sharing with my friends! Thank you!"
2000447384,494491,2017/6/24,5,"This is my go-to recipe! We raise black angus, so we have a lot of hamburger, which can get a bit boring. This recipe really makes hamburger fun again!"
992940,494491,2017/7/6,5,"Easy, fast &amp; flavorful! I use a healthy amount of crushed red pepper because we like it spicy.This is a stable in our house. Thanks!!!!"
1802697968,494491,2017/10/11,5,"Have made this a few times, first time as written, it was okay, maybe I didn't drain enough grease off after browning the ground beef. Made it again with sliced beef, white onion and followed the rest of the recipe, most enjoyable."
124799,494491,2018/2/26,5,"This was surprisingly good for a first try! I used fattier ground beef because on hand, and about 2 tsp fresh minced ginger because also on hand, but it turned out delicious. I would have liked a bit more &quot;sauce,&quot; but not at the sacrifice of this awesome flavor. It was a delightful change from my normal use of ground beef, and will be a definite repeat! It seemed to be beneficial to keep the beef in larger chunks than fine crumbs. Served with white rice and broccoli."
1680722,527822,2016/8/14,5,"I love watermelon salads very much and I really recommend to try this delicious recipe. I served this salad on a big serving plate layering the ingredients (topping with feta, herbs, vinegar and oil). Thanks a lot for offering us this great recipe!"
1783373,527822,2016/8/15,5,"I love salads that contain watermelon and this one was not a disappointment. The addition of parsley, mint, cucumber, etc. surely made it enticing, but the addition of the feta, vinegar, and olive oil made it over the top yum. This is a great salad to serve in the summer season. Thank you Sheepdoc for sharing. Made it for CQ3."
1925885,527822,2016/8/18,5,"So good! I never pass up a watermelon salad, and this was no exception! I love how the sweet and salty play together in this one. The combo of herbs is wonderful. Thanks for posting - this is a keeper! Made for CQ 2106."
107135,504600,2013/8/2,5,wow mr picky is happy man zwt9
461834,504600,2013/8/9,5,"Wonderful breakfast!!  I made 1/3 of the recipe, and as the intro states, added my own mix of veggies (onion, red bell pepper, hashbrown potatoes &amp; cheddar cheese) and chose to top with fresh chives.  I used my small cast iron skillet and it didn&#039;t take as long as the recipe states, but I think I should have used an even smaller pan, as it was quite a thin egg bake.  Served this with blueberry muffins and some fresh fruit.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
386585,504600,2013/8/11,4,"This was pretty simple to make and was very tasty.  I baked some applewood smoked bacon in the oven and used the drippings for the egg cake.  I added the chives to the egg mixture, which gave it a nice, onion-y flavor.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
1803410188,510493,2014/12/11,5,VERY tasty!!!  (served avocado on the side)&lt;br/&gt;Chicken was fabulous by itself even!  Highly recommend.
169430,495352,2013/3/2,5,"This soup earned the highest praise possible from DH :""This is d*nm good soup""!. Now, I must admit that I didn't use the bacon. It's something that I very rarely ever have in the house and there is no way I would consider cooking anything in bacon fat and I didn't feel that the recipe suffered from the omission in any way. I used a bit of olive oil to replace the bacon fat and forged ahead. I made a half amount that gave DH and I dinner servings with enough left over for a couple of smaller lunch servings. The flavors came together beautifully and it was an excellent meal with a side of garlic bread. I will most certainly make this again."
2001761915,496820,2018/7/20,0,"Perfect! This is exactly what I was looking for. Yes, I top half the batch with choco frosting to satisfy a favorite flavor combo. Thanks"
2002117643,511971,2018/4/16,1,THERES NO GUMMI BEARS
2002197842,511971,2018/6/25,5,Awesome! All my kids loved it! I added some other fruits to also make it more nutritional too and it still tasted great!
566447,495352,2013/3/29,5,"I absolutely loved this soup. It had the perfect blending of flavors. It&#039;s hearty but not like stew - because it&#039;s still soupy. We actually called it souper soup ;) I had never had radishes in soup before (that I know of) and I was a little hesitant - but I loved them and I would probably double the amount of radishes in the soup next time. I gotta say, the only thing I did differently was that I used vermicelli soup noodles in place of the flat noodles because my dear husband doesn&#039;t like large flat noodles - and I only used half as much noodles as called for and I found that to be the perfect amount in the soup. This soup is delicious and ready to serve and enjoy the first day. i find that some soups are better the second day - well I enjoyed this the first day... and the kids ate it too!!!"
1900559,498959,2013/4/30,5,This is a very good pico de gallo.  It is much like the one we use only we don&#039;t use hot peppers.  Bravo on this great combination!
865936,499406,2013/10/24,4,I especially liked the nuts and the celery in this salad.
1706426,494405,2013/3/19,4,"I love blue cheese dressing and this did not disappoint ! However, next time I will  leave out the hot sauce and cut the amount of onions in half. I bought sweet onions, but they were stronger than Vidalia&#039;s, which I couldn&#039;t find, so that may have been the problem. Thanks for posting! Made for the Alphabet Soup Tag game."
285039,494405,2013/7/18,5,"I made this dressing to top a wedge salad I was making for a dinner party, and it got rave reviews.  Later in the week, I served it on the side of grilled chicken with buffalo wing sauce.  Clearly a winner!"
381180,494405,2013/9/29,5,"Tangy and VERY tasty!  I cut the recipe in half, used Gorgonzola, and only two tablespoons finely minced Vidalia onion.  Tagged for Fall Rookie Recipe game ~ due 10/13."
131126,494405,2017/5/24,5,"We liked the addition of the caramelized onions. They made for a unique spin on blue cheese, but didn't overpower the tang of the blue cheese. The dressing itself was thick, creamy, and tasty. Will make again!"
1783373,494405,2017/8/3,5,"This is a delicious tasting dressing! I sliced iceberg lettuce to the wedge-style, sprinkled bacon, black pepper, diced onion and drizzled breezers dressing overall and it was fab! Thank you Breezer for sharing!"
1052873,503022,2013/8/21,5,The heat of the spices and coolness of the veggies were a perfect blend. Made for zwt9.
496803,503499,2013/8/1,5,"Oh, my!  This is wonderful bread, perfect for enjoying with that late morning cup of coffee that we Swedes always seem to need.  It is sweet, but not too sweet, and the spicy flavor of the cardamom is very pronounced- exactly what I remember from enjoying this bread as a child.  The only suggestion I would make is to change the two egg whites to one; one was plenty to give a nice glaze to all of the nooks and crannies on the top and sides of the braid and hold the pearl sugar in place."
107135,503499,2013/8/11,5,good easy
480195,503944,2013/7/24,5,Yum! These were memorable. DH loves fresh fruit desserts and said this is one of the best he&#039;s had. I have to agree. I used the orange blossom water. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
80353,503944,2013/7/26,5,This fig dessert was just fantastic.  The figs were very aromatic in the citrusy syrup.  Served with a small dollop of greek yoghurt on the side.
1802859796,499357,2014/6/26,5,"This is a most lovely desert.  I have been on low curb diet no sugar at all, have to drop almost 15kg.  I&#039;m still finding only sugar stuffs.  This recipe is only one created in the world.  I have watched many cooking show never have come across something like this one.  It should be 100% rated"
37449,507928,2013/10/30,5,I was surprised how much I liked this slaw! I used pineapple but left out the oranges.Put just a touch of sugar in with the pineapple juice. Thanks!
267527,497363,2013/3/13,5,"I cut down the amount of fish sauce, used some soy sauce, and cut down a bit of the oyster sauce. My family loved it - a keeper. Thanks, Jan."
251917,497363,2013/3/26,5,"Aussie Swap #74: YUM!! This is one of the ultimate, flavorful comfort foods!! I love the garlicly flavor of the rice - just the best fried rice I have ever had!"
724631,506485,2014/2/17,5,"Very tasty and crusty venison backstrap.  DH opted to cut in 3/4-inch slices, given the cooking times in the recipe (he likes it medium-rare!). I patted each slice dry before basting it with French Dressing (Recipe #241296) on 3 sides; after all slices were moved to the new plate, I basted the 4th side.  Venison came out perfectly.  My order: pat a medallion dry and baste it with French Dressing, then baste top of all strips with French dressing.  I dredged the strips 2-at-a-time in the flour to prevent crowding.  With my egg-milk in a cereal bowl, I dipped a strip in it and tossed it into another freezer bag with the cracker mixture (I used Garlic Butter Ritz crackers -- 49 crackers, about 1 2/3 sleeves), only working with 2 strips at a time to press the mixture in.  I laid these on a plate, placed a sheet of plastic wrap on top, and laid the rest on top, then sealing all with plastic wrap for its chilling time.  Served with Recipe #455256.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
364211,507263,2013/10/11,5,"Oh, be still my excited heart!  10 STAR recipe right here!!!  I loved, loved, loved this!  My mind is already calculating who I will be impressing with this easy dish.  I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breast, cut in thin strips, then saute&#039;d in the butter, left out the water chestnuts and used a dry white wine (it is what I had on hand).  I can see adding a little extra water and rice to to the mix before baking too, but that&#039;s for next time.  Thanks in a big way Cocojane for sharing this GEM.  Made for My 3 Chefs event"
1803594907,500102,2015/1/31,5,I made it for dinner tonight it is wonderful.  I used less ground turkey then called for.&lt;br/&gt; I love it. :)
2729300,497165,2013/3/12,5,The horseradish mustard and garlic really add zing to this recipe.  So easy!  Great with ham or pork chops--or just about anything else!
486725,509019,2015/6/5,5,"Knew when I saw chorizo added to mac n cheese, that we would love this, and we did. I did, however, not make it even more rich (or change the texture) by adding more cheese and breadcrumbs and baking it. We also started with half the chorizo, since we knew ours is really spicy, and it turned out it was spicy, but just right. In case you are confused by the ingredients, you do need to have the milk and margarine on hand, but they are the ones listed in the directions on the package, not in addition to that (breadcrumbs are included in the package/not listed in the ingredients). Thanks for sharing your idea of adding chorizo to mac n cheese - it is a great one!"
1803365032,511990,2014/11/20,1,not even close no flavor tough and chewy im 99.9% sure they use a beer batter style coating completely ruined my dinner my wife has been craving these since she became pregnant  and she would not touch them after tasting it.
44864080,511990,2015/2/1,4,"We are big fans of the Lube, and we love the pickles, so this recipe is a favorite.  Some advice for others - use Claussen garlic dill spears, they are worth the price.  I also doubled the breading portions because I ran out of breading the first time I tried to make a dozen pickles.  I found shaking a shallow pan back and forth to roll the pickle in the breading is easier and neater than breading by hand.  I also added some more spice, used Chipotle seasoning and some Fajita seasoning."
2001453453,527202,2017/3/24,0,"Very disappointed. I should have known, sugar and corn syrup doesn't make caramel sauce. Just wasted an hour in the kitchen , not to mention the ingredients!"
2001066495,527351,2016/6/28,5,the cake was good
2912871,496040,2013/9/17,4,"This turned out great--except for the scorched caramel sauce part.  More instructions about how to keep it from scorching would be appreciated, because I&#039;m really not sure what I did wrong.  I used 2 pinches of sea salt, and that amount was about perfect.  Next time I may add more coffee to cut down the sweetness.  But if I can perfect the caramel, it really will taste astonishingly like Starbucks Salted Caramel Mocha.  I can tell already."
2850395,496040,2015/2/5,0,"Just a word to the wise... Starbucks doesn&#039;t actually use caramel in their Salted Caramel Mocha! In the mocha part, they use Toffee Nut flavoring. They top it with whip cream, caramel DRIZZLE, and sea salt. But unless you use toffee nut instead of caramel, yours will never turn out the same!"
2002044623,536547,2018/9/28,5,Everyone loved it. I like cauliflower so much I made it for me. It was loved by all. Will make it again during football season. Go Pack!
80353,505624,2013/8/24,5,"This was very good - and I especially enjoyed the addition of the chili, which I think made the drink really &#039;special&#039;.  BUT I wasn&#039;t sure if the lychees were meant to be kept whole or pureed.  They really didn&#039;t do much to the drink whole (as I kept them) and were actually a pain to drink around (I ate them quickly).  Instead of simple syrup, I just used some of the syrup the lychees were packed in.  I will make again, but I will puree the lychees next time, I think."
37449,497654,2013/3/25,5,"Delicious! I did make individual  quesadillas and served with salsa and sour cream. Thanks! Made for Pic a Chef(PAC) event, March 2013."
1802678975,497654,2014/4/18,1,"Made this last night. So sorry I wasted the &#039;shrooms and avocados. Really bland and boring. If I&#039;m going to eat something that is so high in fat and calories, it should actually have some flavor."
37449,504866,2013/8/6,5,"A great way to start off the morning! I used just peach nectar, 1 peach and half a mango. I did add in about 5 ice cubes to make this nice and smooth and cold! Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by team Hot Stuff."
143721,504866,2013/8/12,5,"Great refreshing drink for a warm summer evening.  Made as directed using Mango nectar!  After the first glass, I decided to add a twist, and added a shot of coconut rum.  HMMMM!  That hit the spot!!  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;"
226867,504866,2013/9/6,5,"Oh my stars! Was this ever good! I used peaches that I had frozen with a small amount of sugar in pint bags. I used one bag of peaches, the lime, the mango and 1 1/2 cups skim milk (since I had no nectar of any kind). Fabulous! made for ZWT9 Soup-a-Stars"
266635,516218,2014/5/28,5,"This is a great way to make guacamole -- love the nice salty bite from the feta cheese and the rest of the ingredients are what I normally add to this dish.  Made just the way you posted it with the exception that I used red onion. Served with some blue corn tortilla chips. Thanks for the post, my friend. : )"
494084,504131,2014/8/26,5,"This was a nice and easy weeknight tofu dinner.  Instead of peppers I added snap peas because that is what we had.  It came out well...mild but a little sweet and tart too.  Kids liked it as did the parents.  Only thing is that unless I did something wrong, nothing is caramelized, so not so sure about the title.  Thanks for the nice recipe Sharon123!"
610488,504568,2013/8/7,5,Smooth and creamy with a great Swedish salsa topping!! Truly good comfort food.
1072593,493102,2013/3/25,5,Most often I eat in the very best restaurant ever...my kitchen.  Made a great panini! *PAC Spring 2013*
266635,493102,2014/4/30,5,"Love garlic oil and this was so easy to make.  This can be used for garlic bread, pizza and of course, grilled sandwiches.  Made for Spring PAC, 2014."
610488,504820,2013/8/7,4,These made for several wonderful meals - first when I served it with a pea soup from Scandinavia and then for lunch today and also for tomorrow. This recipe makes several albondigas and they are filling. Great flavor!!
1802727810,513271,2014/5/9,5,"Last night, I follow the steps ...&lt;br/&gt;Today, I have a delicious homemade gelato.&lt;br/&gt;My girls love it.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing."
1800054678,513271,2016/4/14,5,"This is super creamy and rich. I put the finished mixture into the freezer and left it undisturbed overnight. The next morning, the gelato turned out great."
128473,512436,2014/4/29,5,"This sandwich was a lovely surprise, we loved the savory flavor from the sauce on top of the bun.  So lovely.  I couldn&#039;t find Hawaiian sweet buns, so I used Filipino Pandesal sweet buns, they worked great in this recipe.  A quick and easy to make sandwich with so much taste and great textures....thank you for sharing this lovely recipe, which I will be enjoying often.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
350750,512436,2015/1/15,5,Made these for Christmas day and was enjoyed by the family.  Thank you!
225096,512436,2015/6/20,5,"Classically good recipe.  I used Primadella Tavern Ham &amp; baby swiss.  Onion powder &amp; regular yellow mustard as I was out of dijon.  Sprinkled the poppy seeds on after brushing &amp; spooning the butter over the rolls.  Better distribution, I think.
Will go in the permanent rotation."
2002198353,512436,2018/6/25,5,"I have made these after a friend shared the recipe with me. Lost the recipe, so I have been using this one which seems to be the exact same. They are always delicious!! My son asks me to make them all the time."
173579,517313,2014/11/3,5,This was wonderful.  My whole family enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting.
2000199754,517313,2015/6/8,2,The chops were very salty. I followed the instructions. I think next time I will do the ranch shake n bake.
2000673184,517313,2015/11/13,5,"I find pre-packaged mixes to be too salty.  I used homemade mix (recipe is on this website), about 2-3 tablespoons for 6 chops, and also used the low sodium, fat free soup mixed with a little buttermilk.  (You can also make homemade condensed cream of chicken soup as it is really easy.)  The chops turned out perfectly, tender and flavorful.  This is one of our favorites."
2001413500,517313,2017/3/2,0,I absolutely love this recipe. I add onions when the chops are almost done.
2001420444,517313,2017/3/6,5,"This is a regular week night meal for our family, we absolutely love it I serve it over rice and use the soup as a gravy over top my kids love it!"
2001694194,517313,2017/8/30,5,Love this recipe for busy work days I have the kids. I've found I like it with rice but it's easy to add the rice to it. Even without the rice the chops are very tender and tend to fall apart when removing. So just be careful on removal. Although shredding the chops with forks after it's cooked makes for a good more casserole type presentation. Good no matter how you plate it.
2001713107,517313,2017/9/13,0,I loved this &amp; so did husband. Would love to add another at least 3 chops in there &amp; wondering if I should add one more packet &amp; one more can of soup? We love mushrooms too so thinking about adding some with some onions
2002040327,517313,2018/3/9,4,The first time I made this I followed the exact recipe and as someone else said it turned out VERY salty. We decided to try it again with some low sodium (heart healthy version) of the cream of chicken soup and it turned out awesome.
2002054560,517313,2018/3/16,0,"I don't like Ranch dressing, so I was leery about trying this recipe. But it was DELICIOUS!! I can't wait to make it again. But I think I'll add mushrooms this time."
2002337831,517313,2018/11/18,5,"The nutrition guide would be mandatory for me, since my husband is diabetic and needs to could carbs for all meals."
2000431901,537073,2018/11/6,5,Absolutely delicious! One of my favorite soups. Made another batch to freeze for later.
169430,493814,2013/2/6,0,"This makes a lot, lol. As I was figuring how much I needed for two I got down to 1 serving and made that. It easily fed DH and I with a bit left over. If you have teenage guys who will eat their own weight in groceries in 2 days this is the recipe that you need :D. We both liked this a lot but it seemed that something was a bit off. It's very likely that this was just from my reducing the recipe to a single serving as changing amounts will change the outcome if not done carefully. I don't know how to adapt to smaller or larger amounts other than just using amount changer on each recipe so for that reason I'm not giving this a set number of stars. Please don't be afraid to try this recipe because we did like it and I really think that if the full amount is made that it will be excellent.<br/><br/>I also want to add that I used chicken bits instead of pieces. One day I ask a market butcher to debone a package of two chickens.<br/><br/>I expected to get back two whole chickens with no bones for stuffing. The guy didn't even give me back deboned recognizable pieces but seriously mangled bits, some as small as a quarter! I used a bunch of those which could have altered the needed cooking time a lot,   as I said I know that changing the amount of a recipe can change the outcome."
1800112237,505753,2013/10/9,5,"This recipe is colossal. It&#039;s vegan, it&#039;s raw, it&#039;s easy, and it is insanely delicious. Healthful flavor nuggets will assail your senses and wow your guests. I made these as part of a Moroccan feast I am preparing for my church tomorrow. A double batch allows me to pass out samples. Every single person who has tasted these pops them in and then eyes fly open wide. &quot;O WOW!&quot; immediately follows, every time. Junk food lovers, health food lovers, every one has raved. Don&#039;t skip the olives and double the salt. These are the Moroccan equivalent of chocolate covered pretzels. These would be perfect on a Christmas party tray."
2691484,495291,2013/2/13,5,You cannot go wrong with bacon and cheese!
2691492,495291,2013/2/13,5,Delicious savory dish recipe that was easy to follow and gives consistent results. Would recommend this recipe to everyone!

2691736,495291,2013/2/13,5,This is a solid dish! It's very delicious! I like spicy so I added half a cup of adobo to the cheese sauce and diced 5 chipotles with the chicken and it was perfect!
2691857,495291,2013/2/13,5,Sounds amazing! Can't wait to try!
2691902,495291,2013/2/13,5,"Wow, this is something I am going to try, chicken, spicy Mac and cheese and bacon, sounds like a heavenly mix!!!!"

2692046,495291,2013/2/13,5,"Bacon seems ubiquitous these days, but GOOD bacon dishes are not. We tried this recipe last night, as we were in dire need of a comfort food dish, and we were blown away by its ease of preparation, its hearty fullness and its remarkably toothsome and great taste. This dish rocks and we'll definitely make it again!"
2692073,495291,2013/2/13,0,Very easy and absolutely delicious recipe.
2692243,495291,2013/2/13,0,"Sounds delicious--my husband loves chipotle, and my son loves bacon and mac & cheese. I think they would love for me to make this!"

2699019,495291,2013/2/18,5,This recipe is easy to make and really flavorful. Best macaroni and cheese I have had in awhile.
2693050,495291,2013/2/19,5,"yum,yum ,yum!!!!!!!...only one problem with the recipe........ that it is too good   ;)"

2705683,494515,2013/2/22,5,"Always looking for fun party recipes, and this one is excellent!"
2709220,495291,2013/2/24,5,This recipe is so GOOD! The ranch and chipotle go very well together. I highly recommend this recipe!
2709267,495291,2013/2/24,5,So delicious! This recipe easy to follow and is worth trying. I used an entire can of chipotles in adobo for more spice. My whole family enjoyed it!
2710071,495291,2013/2/24,5,Every dish I have tried from hmisafiris has been fantastic! I LOVE mac and cheese and this recipe sounds delicious!!! I can't wait to try it...
2710455,495291,2013/2/24,5,"I Love and Cheese. Add ranch dressing seasonings to it and ""Wham"" you have a winner!! Everything went together like a song and tasted fantastic. Bravo to you for such a delicious recipe."
2711946,495291,2013/2/25,5,"Great taste, perfect amount of spice. Will for sure make again!"

2713607,495291,2013/2/27,5,I tried this recipe! It was so delicious!!!!
133547,495291,2013/6/15,5,AWESOME!!! I made this for Father&#039;s Day Dinner and it was a huge hit. I did use only half the adobo seasoning as it 4 TBSP would have made it way too salty for us. Otherwise made exactly as written. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thank you for sharing :)
2324285,495291,2013/8/19,5,"Very good!  I loved the ranch dressing in this, and I usually hate the stuff.  It works well in this dish though, as it adds a nice mellow background flavor.  I left out the chicken completely, as I already had a roast to serve the mac &amp; cheese with.  The bacon and adobo were inspired additions, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to make mac &amp; cheese any other way now that I&#039;ve discovered this recipe.  Just perfect, really- thanks for sharing!"
1802443690,495291,2014/2/4,5,This recipe was a hit!!! Everyone loved it!! I substituted the bread crumbs with sweet chipotle panko bread crumbs by Private Selections and used boneless skinless chicken thighs for juicer meat.  Would definitely recommend this recipe.
2000431901,495291,2016/10/2,5,"So SO good! I used leftover turkey in it. It is pretty spicy since I left the seeds in the peppers. Fortunately my toddler and preschooler love spicy, they just exclaim &quot;HOT!&quot; after every bite!"
2000151773,495291,2018/2/24,4,"I live alone, so a recipe for 10 is a hard starting point! But I liked the sound of it, so I scaled it down as best I could. It's quite a lot of work if you make your own Ranch and Adobo, but I like the cooking, so for me that is a bonus rather than a downer. I like my food a bit hot, but I think I overdid it with the chipotle. I used a (small) whole dried chipotle and I think that was bit ambitious. Even so, the end result was excellent and I shall do it again, being a bit more circumspect with the smokiness. I'm in the UK and I'd never heard of Adobo, and never seen Ranch (though, TBH, I've never looked for either, either - they are probably available somewhere, but they are not common), so I made my own: Ranch - https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/homemade-ranch-salad-dressing/ Adobo - http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/adobo-seasoning-442098 Very pleased with both. As I say, I shall try this again. I just wish there were more recipes for one rather than an extended family! 10/10 for recipe, 7/10 for my execution of it."
285820,518292,2017/6/15,5,Tastes almost identical to Resers! Thank you so much!
2000800801,498972,2016/1/4,5,This was a fun recipe to try!  Simple ingredients come together to make one delicious family meal!  My husband said this was the best &quot;Shepard&#039;s pie&quot; he&#039;s ever had!  I will be making this again and sharing the recipe with friends!
903635,524589,2017/9/21,5,"Very yummy. Changed the recipe to what I had on hand. Added raisins and pecans, and Cointreau (2TBS) because I had no oranges. I would up the spices next time. Hot water canned for 30 minutes. Oh I added 6 cups of chopped apples because I had lots from the tree. Going to make more for Christmas"
2706701,494515,2013/2/23,5,This recipe is amazing and oh so yummy. I am so impressed.
2710869,494515,2013/2/25,5,I like all of this.
2002242475,536700,2018/8/8,5,"Hello, The recipe is really good. My sis tried this recipe &amp; really it turned super tasty. people try this out."
2000650002,508582,2015/11/7,5,I&#039;ve tried so many pizza dough recipes and they&#039;ve always come out doughy in the middle. This came out absolutely beautiful and you can vary the thickness for whatever style you like. Really enjoyed this.
2001081078,508582,2016/7/9,5,Used this recipe many times. Usually make the dough the day before and leave in the fridge until needed. I've also made some pizza bases and frozen them - defrost for an hour before using
2001345183,508582,2017/1/10,5,I made this tonight with my kids and they loved it! I used a dominos pizza sauce reciepe I found online also which I can't find but I took a screen shot which I will attach . I also used dried polenta to dust the bottom of the pizza base before baking like dominos do. Me and my kids agree it tastes just like dominos ! Loved it . Will definitely be making it lots more :)
2001935980,508582,2018/1/16,5,"Delicious! I rolled the dough in a ball and let it rise for 6 hours to get a light and fluffy texture. Then glazed the crusts with melted butter, garlic and parsley. Tastes just like the real thing!"
2002060903,508582,2018/3/18,0,I worked for Dominos for 7 years and this is the closest to their recipe that I’ve ever tried
2710896,494515,2013/2/25,5,comfort food snack - just make a lot of it and call it dinner. SO good!
999320,498998,2013/9/18,2,"I received this recipe from a friend. I couldn&#039;t wait to try it! I bake quite a bit throughout the year; holidays, especially at Christmas time. Upon making these cupcakes I was somewhat disappointed. I am planning on making them for a man I am dating...have to say I am so glad I made them before our weekend together.  I will make them again with adjustments...they need a bit of salt to balance out the sweetness and maybe a bit of vanilla.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will post after adjustments are made :)"
1800319589,498998,2013/11/25,0,Add 1stick of butter instead and 1tsp.vanilla extract.
80353,503893,2013/7/16,5,"The tenderloins, prepared as per Lori&#039;s excellent instructions, were juicy and flavourful, but what was really outstanding was the fantastic glaze the tenderloins get doused with!  Both sweet and spicy hot, and with the undertone of the bourbon (which does not overwhelm), we were licking our forks!  Thanks Lori!"
539686,503893,2013/7/19,5,Yum! This is delicious! The glaze has a nice zing to it and the tenderloins cook up quickly. I&#039;ll definitely have this again.
135470,503893,2013/7/24,5,This was super delicious! I followed the directions for grilling and the meat came out really tender and juicy. We loved the contrast of the sweet and spicy with the bourbon. I glazed half with the glaze as written and half with a version with no syrup and using brown sugar Splenda.&lt;br/&gt;I will add this to my collection of favorite pork loin recipes. Made for ZWT 9 by one of the Appliance Killers.
461834,503893,2013/7/27,5,"WOW!!!!  What a great recipe for pork tenderloin!!  I am a wimp when it comes to heat/spicy foods, but this one is so addicting (despite being spicy) that I kept going back for more meat, lol!!  Just loved the flavors of the sweet spicy glaze with the spicy meat and then the flavor of the grill that comes into play from  the BBQ, so good.  This one is going into my &quot;Best of&quot; cookbook.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
226863,503893,2014/2/2,5,"I had one 24 ounce tenderloin, so increased the cook time a bit.  I used the indirect grilling method, and found that it took me a bit more time to get the meat up to temp.  The glaze is delicious.  I made sure to put half aside so I wouldn&#039;t contaminate it when basting my pork while it was on the grill.  So glad I did!  Made for Best of 2013 Tag game.  Thanks for sharing!"
165933,510525,2014/1/10,5,"We really enjoyed this chicken.  I had to scale it down for one chicken breast and did salt and pepper the chicken before dipping in the flour.  This was, naturally, very sweet so be sure to use real bacon and not turkey bacon (my mistake)!  The sage added an interesting flavor.  Thanks for a tasty recipe."
2002131477,535666,2018/4/27,2,"Eeek. This recipe wasn't what I was looking for. It tastes ok, I'll admit, but boy, was it a hassle! If you are looking for quick and easy... well maybe don't do this one."
2001245747,535666,2018/6/1,4,"I don't care for sweets in the morning, so this caught my eye right away. It was delicious, but I added a bit more cheese to make it crisper. I used some rustic bread instead of the sour dough--looked exactly like the bread in the video, but less tang."
1925885,503339,2013/8/5,3,"This was just ok for us - not bad but not &quot;jump out of my seat&quot; good.  Mostly, I didn&#039;t like the mouth feel of the carrot pulp - even though I  put it through cheesecloth twice.  I think it would be better if our carrots had been a bit sweeter and more flavorful. Thanks for posting this unusual drink!"
1800272150,505701,2013/11/18,5,Changed chick peas for garden peas and it was delicious
2324285,501628,2013/11/7,4,"I&#039;ve never had a goulash quite like this.  It tastes like a pasta casserole, and it was filling and tasty enough.   I liked how easy it was to prepare, and it was ready in minutes."
131126,501628,2013/11/16,5,"I used Italian sausage, fresh garlic and onion, frozen corn kernels, bow tie pasta,  and a mixture of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. This turned out to be satisfying comfort food and I liked that it was loaded with veggies.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
865936,527492,2016/7/18,5,"This is a delicious teriyaki recipe. Commercial sauces usually have too much sugar, but making it yourself is so much better tasting. This was a snap to make."
157425,527492,2016/7/25,5,Great steaks! I used three sirloin steaks and left them whole this time. Had portabella mushrooms on hand that needed to be used so added them. We have bought teriyaki sauce and it was terrible but this sauce is so good. DH asked that we make these steaks again! Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest 2016 - Japan.
1287956,513025,2014/2/13,5,"I used my blender to puree the chipotle and adobe sauce with about a half-cup of cream, and then let the chicken marinate all day.  The only problem I had with this recipe is that there was nothing left-over for lunch the next day, so I&#039;ll have to double the recipe next time."
9643716,512459,2014/8/16,5,"this is delicious and so easy to make. When baking don&#039;t put you pan on the last rack, it cooks the dough too quickly, otherwise YUMMY!!!"
169430,512799,2014/4/17,5,"Great lentil soup. I made a 1/2 recipe as there are just 2 of us and packed most of it into 4 freezer bags to have ready on demand. Since I&#039;m not a huge corn fan I did skip that but really loved the jalapeno addition. Very high yum factor. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
128473,497896,2014/6/8,5,"Wow, were these tasty corn cakes ever good.  I made 1/2 the recipe, exactly as written and ended up with 6 beautiful big pancakes.  The corn cakes  were fragile, light, thin, gritty and flavorful.  I used coconut oil to fry them , wow was it good with the cornmeal. These cakes are very fragile, let them set up a bit before turning and be very gentle with them.  If they are mushy when you go to turn, let them set up more. They finish setting as they cool.    I cooked mine on med low for two or three minutes before turning.  Garnished with maple syrup for a memorable treat.  The maple syrup penetrates the cakes beautifully.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe."
2000428663,497896,2015/8/25,5,"This is actually a Latin American dish called &quot;cachapas&quot; (in Venezuela) like corn pancakes but much healthier and tastier. Try them filled with white cheese (halloumi works nicely), shredded pork, avocado or/and fried sweet plantains (all or only one of the above), bend it in half, to sort of contain all the ingredients or if you are only using cheese, to allow the cheese to melt in between both hot surfaces. Put in some butter and enjoy :D I was so happy to find a recipe in english I&#039;m always trying to explain what cachapas ae and will now be redirecting people to this  english recipe."

2710954,495134,2013/2/25,5,This is MY kind of meal. Love pork & shrimp.
2597942,493956,2013/1/27,5,"Bravo Sue! Delicious! I didn't have any garlic to roast, but used extra garlic powder. My crust came our kinda mushy... but that could've been my error. The flavor was great! I used ""Crystal"" brand Lousiana hot sauce & fresh grated parm cheese. Everyone watching the ""Chicago Black Hawks"" game loved it."
498271,499576,2013/6/7,4,"This is a nice and easy recipe, great for a busy weeknight!  I used brown rice and also enjoyed the crunch of the Chinese noodles.  Simple and tasty - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
2597942,499576,2013/6/28,4,"I made this for dinner this past week, and we did enjoy it. It is very simple to make (and I like the fact that its inexpensive). I thought 2 onions and the entire 1 cup of celery was too much, tho. Next time I make this I will use 1 onion and maybe 1/3 cup of celery. The flavor was good. I used white rice and fresh bean sprouts (rather than canned), but unfortunately, &quot;someone&quot; ate my chinese noodles that I had hidden in the cupboard... but hubby swears he didn&#039;t eat them! Thank you for posting. I will make this again. (Made for &quot;Name That Ingredient&quot; tag)"
315565,503884,2013/7/24,5,Very enjoyable brownies ! I did not do the icing as it would have been a bit too sweet for our tastes. The stove top method of making them really appealed to me as this became a very quick recipe to whip up. They were eaten in a flash. Made for ZWT9.
2001625722,532486,2017/7/14,5,It was Delicious!! I will definitely be using this recipe again. Loved it!
482376,532486,2017/7/20,5,Excellent complete meal. We loved the bass with the tomato and onion mixture. Great technique and great flavor! The only tweak I made was to take the potatoes out and pan fry them a bit before serving. The whole dish was excellent. Thank you!
1783373,532486,2017/7/26,5,"Delicious way to cook fish. I love the flavor that the tomatoes, onion, lemon and garlic imparts (btw: I added extra garlic because I'm a garlic lover) and how it makes its own sauce. YUM Mediterranean style dish! I added the potatoes, but if watching carbs, they can just be left out with no flavor loss. I didn't realize that I was out of parsley so I subbed cilantro and it worked out beautifully. A wonderful and complete meal that will most definitely be made again. Thank you for sharing PanNan! Made it for CQ4, 2017 (Turkey)."
1802633408,514838,2014/3/31,5,This looks so DELICIOUS! I can&#039;t wait to try it this weekend for my husband&#039;s birthday.
13024245,514838,2014/4/1,0,This would be perfect breakfast recipe for when you have company.  Can&#039;t wait to try it!
1802618967,514838,2014/3/26,5,"This looks AMAZING, can&#039;t wait to try it"

1802627494,514838,2014/3/29,5,These are not only amazingly yummy but so easy to make. My new favorite breakfast!
1802627597,514838,2014/3/29,5,Made these for a delicious Saturday morning breakfast. So easy and the scallions add so much!
1802627951,514838,2014/3/29,5,This looks amazing!! I definitely will be trying this soon!
1802628183,514838,2014/3/29,5,"I tried these this morning with my boyfriend for bunch, so good!"
1802628229,514838,2014/3/29,5,Love the simplicity of the ingredients for preparing and the fun individual sized presentation!
1802628226,514838,2014/3/29,5,Such a great breakfast idea!  I was really looking for something different and I got so many compliments from my friends!
1802628468,514838,2014/3/29,5,"DELISH! Can&#039;t rave enough about an easy, no-fuss recipe that tastes this good."
45246383,514838,2014/3/29,4,Simple and easy breakfast on the go! Delish!
1802628771,514838,2014/3/30,5,"All my favorites, bacon,eggs,cheese and potatoes.  Perfect for a brunch!"

1802631445,514838,2014/3/30,5,I&#039;m so excited to try this!
1802631435,514838,2014/3/30,5,This is one of the most delicious breakfast dishes I&#039;ve ever had!  A welcome diversion from the standard egg options.
1802631526,514838,2014/3/30,5,What a simple yet delicious idea! I can&#039;t wait to make this for breakfast at home!
1802631672,514838,2014/3/30,0,Looks delicious!
1802619867,514838,2014/3/31,5,Simple and tasty compact breakfast.
1584953,513258,2014/12/1,1,"I&#039;ve given this recipe 1 star for potential only. First, I followed the directions to a T., and as written, but how does one cook onions until tender in butter, over high heat without the butter AND onions burning? I anticipated this happening so I added olive oil to the butter. There was no way I could then sear the scallops in this until golden. As it was, the onions became very dark, just short of burning completely.  The flour, cheese and salt mix ratio to milk was way off and made the wine sauce waaay too thick. I had to add at least another 1/2 to 1 cup of wine to the pan, and continue to cook, but didn&#039;t want to reduce too much.  After having to make all of these adjustments, the end flavor was bland, but acceptable, but only after I added some red pepper flakes and Old Bay seasoning.  A good starter recipe, and thanks for posting."
1271506,513258,2015/2/24,5,"Today was the last day of scallops season here in Eastern Maine and so we made this recipe.  Absolutely fabulous!  I was afraid that the cheese might make the sauce too heavy, but it was just the right balance of flavors (I think I may have added a little more parsley than called for, but that&#039;s me).  I will definitely make this again next year!"
7245213,514838,2014/3/31,5,This was pretty amazing and super easy to make. Next time I&#039;ll try using pepperjack cheese.
1802632273,514838,2014/3/31,5,I love this recipe!
1802632476,514838,2014/3/31,5,"This is basically genious. What more could you ask for? It&#039;s cheesy, it&#039;s meaty, it&#039;s brekky, it&#039;s da bomb."
1802644244,514838,2014/4/5,5,"Tasty, tasty, tasty!  Love the simplicity, I feel like I could whip this up on a weekday morning before getting the kids ready for school."
1802647160,514838,2014/4/6,5,This is the amazing breakfast! Delicious and so satisfying!
1802647324,514838,2014/4/6,5,What a fun recipe!  So simple yet delish
1802647346,514838,2014/4/6,5,Yum yum yum!!!
1802647908,514838,2014/4/6,5,So tasty!
1802648838,514838,2014/4/6,5,Love it!
1802650119,514838,2014/4/7,5,Really easy and delicious.  Easy for company or a brunch event.
1802650413,514838,2014/4/7,5,Excellent!
1802650709,514838,2014/4/7,5,"Love.  Would be fun to play around with ingredients next time, based on mood.  Could easily had a Mexican flare with jalapenos and pepperjack cheese substituted in."
1802650726,514838,2014/4/7,5,"Not a scallion person, so left those out.  It was awesome though!  My husband wants me to use the scallions next time --- we&#039;ll see."
1802650982,514838,2014/4/7,5,What a fabulously tasty recipe and so easy to follow! yumm :)
1802650992,514838,2014/4/7,5,These are such a fun twist on a normal breakfast - I really like how they&#039;re portioned out already as well! Definitely going to try these out this weekend!!
1802651085,514838,2014/4/7,5,Quick and easy! Wonderful recipe!
1802651397,514838,2014/4/7,5,Excellent Recipe!
1802651685,514838,2014/4/7,5,Looks delish!!
1802652409,514838,2014/4/8,5,Delicious!
1802656559,514838,2014/4/9,5,Yummy!
386585,527835,2016/8/24,5,"I never thought I would attempt to make bagels, but it was surprisingly easy! I made a poppy seed variation, and halved the recipe. I chose to make the smaller, regular-size bagels. The results were pretty good! Note that the recipe instructions refer to malt, which the brown sugar is a substitute for (just to clear up that confusion). Made for Culinary Quest 2016."
2549237,503740,2013/7/16,5,"This rice was simple and delicious.  It was not overly spicy and was very filling even though it is a lighter version of a classic.  I love that this dirty rice used brown rice, as I am always looking for a new way to get healthy grains into our diet.  Thanks for such a great recipe Justlori.  Made for ZWT9 for Team Tasty Testers."
1706426,503740,2013/7/24,5,"I really liked this. I have only had Dirty Rice once before ( from a boxed mix )and hated it, so this was a nice surprise. Thanks for sharing, made for ZWT9"
133174,503740,2013/7/25,4,This recipe gets a big thumbs up.  I typically have precooked brown rice in the freezer which made quick work of this recipe.  The recipe was reduced to 2 wonderful servings using a country style sausage in place of the ground beef.  The recipe was lacking a little with spice but was easily corrected with some Tabasco on the side.  Made for ZWT9.
128473,503740,2018/8/15,5,"Awesome rice Lori. We loved it, thank you so much for sharing this keeper of a recipe. It was quick and easy to make with excellent results. I did up the spice a bit, (personal preference only). Kudos on making it into my Best of Cookbook for 2018. Made For Susie's World Tour - Cajun/Creole"
65502,503740,2018/8/21,5,So delicious!! I've always wanted to make dirty rice and now I know I'll make it again! I loved the brown rice and all of the different flavours with the veggies and spices and the shrimp? So good! Thanks Jostlori! :)
226867,503740,2018/9/1,5,"Oh yum - I like dirty rice anyway, but the shrimp put it over the top! I used white rice b/c that's what I had! Made for SWT2018"
1052873,503740,2018/9/3,5,Used white rice which cooks faster so it was a race to the finish. Easy and tasty.
1680722,518221,2014/9/11,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe. I used vacuumized boiled peeled beets, that I put undo the broiler before until roasted. After cooling down I prepared the recipe as you suggested.&lt;br/&gt;I really loved very much the topping and the change form our standard recipe.&lt;br/&gt;Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
1802818676,516665,2014/6/12,5,This recipe will be my new go to for delicious but healthy biscuits!
2123645,536662,2018/9/17,5,Amazing recipe! I made this in the instant pot and it was some of the best carnitas we've ever had.
865936,495342,2013/3/1,4,"This was really good and I am learning to appreciate creole flavors more and more.  I made this for myself to take to work and happened to have made a muffaletta the day before. I put them together for a photo shoot and then showed my husband how pretty.  Well, Mr Anorexia thought it was for him and nearly ate it all up!  Thanks for posting."
254614,495342,2013/3/2,5,"This was a delicious sauce. I used with canned drained chunk salmon as a salad,did not use<br/>any hot sauce since creole seasoning and horseradish provided enough heat. I will marinate<br/>shrimp next time over night."
1625324,496354,2013/3/4,4,a little sweet but tasty
131126,495342,2013/3/2,5,"I used with shrimp and flaked crab.  I fine chopped everything as directed because they were listed as part of the dressing.  The next time I make this I leave the veggies slightly chunky and add with the seafood. I used dill relish & served on leaf lettuce with slices of avocado. The sauce is EXCELLENT and could be used on many things! I think it would even be good as a dipping sauce for crab cakes, salmon patties or on a pasta salad. It's well balanced, was a creative use of contest ingredients so GREAT JOB!"
1802936715,536843,2018/9/20,1,"Sorry to say, it was not good at all. It had no flavor and I followed the recipe exactly as stated. Wanted to like it as it is a simple meal, but did not work out for us."
439797,500856,2014/11/10,5,This was great!!
527964,500856,2015/7/18,5,"These ribs were Awesome!  I added not only one tbsp of paprika, but I also added a 1/2 tbsp of smoked Paprika for added flavor. Next time I will also add some Garlic."
2485765,500856,2015/9/23,0,This is delicious!  I love the dry rub and then the BBQ sauce/broil.  Very easy and was wonderful to come home to after work.  My teenager and husband loved it too.
2000898808,500856,2016/3/2,4,"This was really good. I did 6-6.5 hrs on low, 20 min in the over at 380 and 7 min on broil. I also added a little extra sauce when I put it on the plate. Really good! Maybe just a bit too much cumin but that&#039;s an easy fix :) Will do again! Way easier than grilling!"
2001568344,500856,2017/6/4,5,"I've made these several times and several of my friends heard me raving about them so they too tried them out. It was unanimous...we all loved them! So easy to do and it's impossible to mess up. Even my dad who, at first, complained they'd be missing that signature smokiness you can only really achieve with a grill- was impressed. Also, if it's hot outside and you want to avoid turning on your oven for even a minute-you can throw these awesome ribs on your outside grill for 20 minutes or so to firm them up and glaze them with your favorite barbecue sauce. You won't be sorry...I promise!"
2001614710,500856,2017/7/6,5,This is my one and only go to recipe for baby back ribs. Everyone raves about them. Thanks

2002029643,500856,2018/3/4,0,I'm so confused on directions. Cook 6.5 or 8 hours Cook in oven 20 min or 7. Making them today.
2002049348,500856,2018/3/13,5,this was amazing. my family loved it! I will make it again and again and again!
2002112769,500856,2018/4/14,0,"Letting the ribs sit now for two hours with the rub on. Reading previous posts, I might cook for 5 hours on &quot;low,&quot; then sit on &quot;warm&quot; for the last hour. Won't know if I'll put them under the broiler or out on the grill to finish off---that way, they shouldn't be falling off the bone too much.

2000974814,500856,2018/5/26,1,Confusing. First paragraph says cook 8 hrs. Then a note. Then it says cook 6.5 hours.
2002230274,500856,2018/7/27,3,"Well they're the tenderest ribs I've ever done. But definitely need to cut crock pot time to about 3.5 hours . Will try again tomorrow and see how that works. Facebook rest batch literally just pork meat because the bones fell out as I removed from crock pot after 5 hours. So again the others are right, delicious recipe timing is a little tricky."
2002297669,536843,2018/10/10,5,I was a little surprised to see the previous reviewer said it had no flavor. We thought it had loads of flavor. I did use Italian flavored bread crumbs instead of plain. It was very tasty and easy to prepare. This one is a keeper. Thanks!
107583,511472,2014/5/5,5,"You have a convert.  I have never cared for corn in my chowders and was going to leave it out, but decided to give it a try to stick to the recipe as written.  I really liked it!  This is a nice change from clam chowder and we will be having it again.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."

131126,508536,2014/10/11,5,These baked up nice &amp; crispy which was a welcome plus.  The recipe is easy to follow and the salmon cakes had a nice texture and held together beautifully.  .  Next time I would add more of the Old Bay to perk up the flavor a bit. (Note: I tend to use more seasonings as I reduce salt wherever possible.)  I didn&#039;t make the sauce portion of the recipe. I served with cocktail sauce instead. Thank yo for sharing a recipe I&#039;ll use again!
128473,500834,2013/6/10,5,"Wow, is this good.  So simple, so quick and so easy....did I say.... SO Delicious, it was.  I used wildflower honey, I couldn&#039;t believe how it toned down the garlicy, hot and spicy Sriracha Sauce.  It is terrific, I can see so many uses for this lovely dipping sauce.  Today, I drizzled it over Kentucky fried chicken, so very good, just the perfect amount of heat.  I can&#039;t wait until tomorrow, I will be serving it as a dipping sauce for shrimp.

Oh! And I&#039;d suggest smoothing even the pate reserved for storage before topping with butter. Just a reminder if you&#039;re dumb like me."
2000432195,516702,2015/8/26,0,Just made this with whitefish livers that came my way.  Really nice but I might cut back a bit on the salt.  You can always add more.  Processed in the Vitamix because I like buttery smooth pate.
482933,504422,2013/8/16,5,"I have this recipe inside my 1963 Good Housekeeping cookbook and have made it lots so we do like it but with considerably less salt so I reduced it when making this time. Easier to start with less salt--taste- and add as needed.  Also added a dash of pepper. Love the combo of rice, cauliflower, and shrimp.  I am very glad you posted as I do not drag my cookbooks to AZ during winter."
226863,499678,2013/5/28,5,"I cut this recipe down to serve one, and this was really delish!  I used freshly caught snapper, and cut it pretty thin.  The breading was perfect....not too thick, but very lemony and flavorful.  This fish recipe is really easy to make, and took me about 15 minutes total time....not counting the time cleaning the fish!  A great dinner for me on a work night.  I enjoyed with a garlic rice and a citrusy asparagus side.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game."
169430,499678,2014/4/12,5,"Oh My Gosh, this is a lemon fan&#039;s dream. I used a huge pickerel fillet cut in half for two and used half the batter amount.

482376,499678,2018/8/19,5,Great and very easy fried fish! The batter was nice and light and the lemon flavor came through nicely. I love the addition of baking soda to the batter mixture.

Sometimes cachaca-based drinks can be harsh because much of the cachaca available in US liquor stores is not of the highest caliber, but this was sweet, a little tart and very easy to drink. I like caipirinhas with just the lime and sugar, but the passionfruit juice put this one over the top. I definitely would&#039;ve had two of these if I didn&#039;t have a couple of other drinks to try for Culinary Quest, lol. Thanks for posting!"

520830,499012,2018/2/12,4,I needed to use some ground beef and was looking for something appealing. I had all of the ingredients so this was easy to make. I liked the creaminess of the base and the sauce was easy to make but it was a bit bland. Next time I will add some minced garlic and a rounded teaspoon of dried Italian seasoning to the meat sauce. I like cracked black pepper in cream sauces to add a punch of flavor. This is a good base but needs a bit more seasoning to really shine. I am a fan of ratherbeswimmin. Thanks for the recipe.

Also, there was a lot more sauce than was actually needed.  My husband took the sauce/chicken/artichoke mixture that was left and ate it like a stew.

In addition to the citrus fruit, I used a few fake leaves to give the candles more content. Didn&#039;t have hot glue, but super glue worked fine for me. I will probably leave the candles around in the house for as long as possible. They are so pretty! Thank you Jolie for this amazing recipe!"
2001523770,518016,2017/5/6,1,This recipe was an epic fail .
39835,496835,2013/8/21,4,This is good - but more like bread than the usual banana bread. I was able to get three mini/individual loaves out of this recipe. I made a few changes (making it probably a bit less healthier) - by using regular flour instead of the whole wheat and oat flour. I also used cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice and used 2 bananas (did not measure) and mashed them instead of melting them. I also used almond butter (but wanted to use the rest of the jar so didn&#039;t measure) and almond milk. I forgot the almond extract and the sugar. A very good recipe for the individual loaves I like making for my family. Thanks for sharing!
133174,495304,2013/3/1,4,Made for Dining on a Dollar February 2012. This slaw does not get soggy.  The water and vinegar method does work. I enjoy oriental slaw and was attracted to this recipe because of the well thought out ingredients list.  I did reduce the radishes as mine were rather large.  Sliced almonds were used.  My only suggestion would be to toast the almonds and add them prior to serving to help remain more crunch.  I can see myself making this recipe again.  Good luck in the contest.
1195537,495304,2013/3/1,4,"I really enjoyed the crispy greens, the vinegar/water soak is a great idea! I did find the dressing a little bland so I added some grated ginger, garlic and a drop of sesame oil, it was delicious and easly adaptable to personal preferences. Made and reviewed for for  ""Dining on a Dollar"", March 2013."
174096,495304,2013/3/2,4,"A refreshing take on slaw!  The lime juice and zest added a bright flavor.  The almonds aren%u2019t included in the directions, so I accidentally left them out since I was prepping the rest of the meal during the 30 minute rest time for the slaw and got distracted.  Fortunately, I had some leftover slaw so I tried it out with sliced almonds the next day.  We really liked the addition a lot.  And yes, the slaw stayed pretty crispy the next day too, so that was great.  Thank you, and good luck!"
131126,495304,2013/3/2,4,A nice take on slaw. I will definitely be making this again. I made the slaw early in the day  and kept the dressing to add 30 minutes prior to serving. At first bite one diner thought the slaw needed sweetness. I actually liked the dressing better the next day. The tart dressing had mellowed & the salad was still fairly crisp.  I appreciated learning the vinegar/ water bath method.  The recipe does make an excess of dressing and omitted adding the almonds in the directions.  Good luck in the contest!

2835006,498921,2013/5/21,5,Yum! Quadrupled the recipe for me and my husband and we like to cook once and eat twice. This was a great way to use the spinach and cherry tomatoes we had on hand. I probably used more chicken than the recipe called for. Used non-fat feta cheese and it made the dish! Looking forward to leftovers!
2324285,498921,2013/10/20,5,"Very good.  I had to quadruple the recipe, and it made just the right amount for 4 servings- although I used more chicken.  I was surprised that it didn&#039;t need much seasoning at all-  just a bit of salt and pepper.  I also toasted my quinoa for 15 minutes before cooking it to bring out that nice nutty flavor, which really made this dish shine."
2001688831,498921,2017/8/27,0,"Just 2 TABLESPOONS of chicken for the whole bowl? Just wondering if this is a misprint? Looks good, but I was thinking it would be hard to measure chicken by tablespoons and thought perhaps there was supposed to be at least a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chicken?"
329769,495353,2013/3/1,5,5 stars awarded by my family who have all enjoyed this recipe. I doubled the recipe and very glad that I did. The onions and tomatoes were a great addition to the baked drumsticks. My husband has requested this recipe again. Good luck in the competition
542159,495353,2013/3/1,5,"Mouthwatering meal when served with rice so as to not lose any of the yummy juices from the marinade or juice from the tomatoes. I made using the chili paste option, a pretty and tasty meal that we will be enjoying again. Good luck in the contest and thanks for the post."
239758,495353,2013/3/4,5,"Love the fact that dinner was baked in a single pan. I made exactly as written, but think the dish would further benefit from a longer time marinating. Nice use of contest ingredients. Good luck and thanks for creating this delicious recipe."
822358,493249,2013/1/10,4,The combination of the red pepper and star anise was a good flavor for the pork kofte (kefte).  Five spice powder would be a good substitute and somewhat easier to find--grinding the star anise was somewhat difficult.  The slaw went well with the meat.
2681788,496231,2013/3/12,5,I really enjoyed this dish. The potatoes were creamy and delightful. The pastry was light and the prosciutto bits on top added a nice crispy crunch to the flavorful potatoes. I would have this dish again and again
798181,502291,2013/9/14,4,"I made this recipe for a light dinner &amp; I had all ingredients so it was a very quick &amp; easy sandwich. Unfortunately, it received mixed reviews.I thought it was tasty. Other family members thought it was average. I do think if the apple had been sliced thicker, it would&#039;ve added more, but when reviewing I always follow the recipe exactly. DS didn&#039;t even know it had apple on it."

2123645,531537,2018/9/17,5,"So delicious and easy! I used quinoa flakes instead of breadcrumbs to make it gluten-free. I did have a little trouble with the sauce burning on the bottom, but I think I would add a little water to counteract that next time. This recipe is a keeper!"
2858389,501430,2013/6/10,0,This recipe sounds like it was never actually tested. Deep frying a large portion of raw dough will not work in 325 degree oil. IF it did work it would take MUCH longer than the 2-3 minutes the recipe states. And the low frying temperature would allow the dough to absorb a large quantity of the oil. &lt;br/&gt;How do you divide the pudding cup in half for 3 doughnuts?&lt;br/&gt;Seems to me this was a thrown together recipe to ride on the coat-tails of the Cronut craze.
2198343,501430,2014/11/30,2,"We found the instructions on how to make the cronuts to be a little confusing, and after reading the review of the recipe, we weren&#039;t sure how it would turn out. But we were curious to try it anyway. It was difficult to get the right shape and the first one we fried burned really quickly. After trying it a couple of times, we found that heating the oil then reducing the heat to low worked best. And because we weren&#039;t happy with the shape, we decided to try a second batch using refrigerated biscuit dough instead of crescent roll dough. We though the came out better that way"
184530,502130,2014/1/3,0,"I made this for dinner a couple of nights ago, and we enjoyed it very much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used Barilla fettucine rigate and about 250 grams of baby spinach, which was all I had.  I used chili infused olive oil in place of the plain olive oil and chilli flakes. The flavour was delicious, but there could have been more &quot;sauce&quot; to cover the pasta.  Adding lots of good parmesan and some sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper made a big difference to the taste, so don&#039;t scrimp on these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will make it again using more spinach and more sun dried tomatoes, oil etc and come back and leave a rating."
128473,495523,2013/3/5,5,"After making this, all I can say is WOW.  Was this good.  Well worth the extra effort and time to make this delicious treat.  You will not be disappointed.  The pancakes were beautifully spiced, light, tender and fluffy filled with pecans and the topping was excellent.  Mine turned out like candied brittle, but I certainly didn't mind.  A very nice addition to the pancakes.  Thanks for sharing this winner that I will certainly make again."
1557902,496332,2014/8/31,0,Very easy and good!  I added pepper and seasoned salt.  Next time I&#039;ll use Simply Potatoes O&#039;Brien hash browns.
2001734478,528506,2017/9/30,0,This was seriously so good. My friend who is not vegan tried some and was so impressed! It was a beautiful meal and made me happy.
804550,497110,2013/5/16,5,WOW ANN! Another great coffee recipe! I cheated a tad in the fact I used Peach Schnapps and  Kahlua. The coffee was Moca Java and I dusted the whipped cream with 70 percent dark chocolate shavings from a nutmeg grater. I enjoyed this last night after dinner. Made for Veg N&#039; Swap #58.
107583,512429,2014/4/16,4,"This turns out very moist for turkey meatloaf.  And lots of flavor.  This is a good method for having meatloaf in the summer when you don&#039;t want to heat up the kitchen using the oven, or in our RV where the oven is tiny and heats up the whole RV beyond comfortable.  The only changes I will make next time are to line the bottom of the slow cooker with foil, to keep the spill overs from burning onto the surface and adding the cheese about halfway through the cooking time, so it won&#039;t overcook as mine did.  Made for Spring 2104 PAC."
1419314,536696,2018/8/22,5,"This was a unique, healthy and delicious recipe. Thank you for taking the time to post it. It broke up the monotony of our meals while staying nutritious. Loved the halved lemons grilled and then juiced!"
46217902,498096,2014/8/6,5,"Made this yesterday and the end result was fabulous!  My cheese never got dry or cracked in the oven but I could tell it was gelled enough.  I hung it in a cotton bag for 6hrs and it made 3-4 cups of cheese.  For this to be SDC legal you need to make your own buttermilk as commercial buttermilks have starches and gums in them.  I got buttermilk starter culture online which can be propagated over and over.  So thankful this worked out, dry curd cottage cheese isnt available anywhere near me and I&#039;m sure this is cheaper.  I also used all organic milk."
2001988538,498096,2018/2/12,0,"In stage 1, adding the buttermilk and whole milk, then letting it stand for 24 hours. This stands at room temperature overnight ? The milk wont spoil or curdle ? The second thing is, what do you consider an oven proof pot ? Can an aluminum pot be used ? Thank you. I will await your response."
260911,505464,2013/9/1,5,"For a quick bread, this is quite tasty.  Good crust and nice flavor.  Mine came out just a little bit crumbly but it was delicious with a little butter.  I did add a TBSP or two of milk in place of part of the water.  My husband had several pieces with jam.  I&#039;ll make this again when I&#039;m short on time and need a quick bread with dinner."
1802496188,505464,2014/2/16,5,"This turned out better than I expected. I made in mixer with dough hook and got a smooth workable dough. I made 8 dinner rolls scaled at 75g each. The end result gives a texture midway between soda bread and a scone with an excellent crust. Tastes like a milder, slightly chewier version of soda bread. Yummy warm with honey."
1803152323,505464,2014/9/20,2,"The pros: Quick, easy, few ingredients. Very simple to make if you need bread within the next hour and want a home-made one.&lt;br/&gt;The cons: Very mild taste, not that good and not fluffy/soft enough. I expected more."
2000944924,505464,2016/3/27,5,"This quick bread recipe is perfect when you need bread on the fly. I added orange zest, a pinch of sugar and a smidge of vanilla for absolutely delicious scones."
2001518545,505464,2017/5/2,0,I used this dough to make a pepperoni and cream cheese roll!! Pretty excited! As someone with a degree in pastry arts I was very pleased with this elasticity of this dough!
2002171658,505464,2018/6/1,5,I tried this recipe yesterday and was very pleased with the results. Its important to handle the dough as little as possible to get a nice light textured bread that does not turn out heavy like a scone or biscuit.
1800407045,504436,2013/12/4,5,best chili I have ever had
2002133080,504436,2018/4/28,5,"I made this recipe exactly as printed. After four hours in the crockpot, I tasted it and it was the best chili I have ever had. Four more hours later and it seemed to have lost a little of the sharpness in the taste. I think if I had added more allspice at that point, it would have been just as good as it was earlier. So, next time, I will time it so I am serving after four hours."
1088574,492824,2013/4/21,4,"This is a great recipe!  It is VERY close to the Ruby Tuesday Shrimp Fondue.  I doctored mine up a little bit, adding some emmental cheese, salt, pepper and 2 spoonfuls (about 3 Tbsp) of Farm Boy Steakhouse Garlic dressing and dip. My friend said it was BETTER than Ruby Tuesday&#039;s! WINNER!"
2001328057,492824,2016/12/30,5,"I made this recipe the other day and it was AMAZING and so close to the Ruby Tuesdays version. However, I want to bring it to a party! Do you think it would be okay in a crockpot?"
2001465138,492824,2017/3/31,5,"I made this for a party, (dbl) the recipe, and have a considerable amount left over, can I freeze the rest?"
96177,502904,2013/7/20,5,"Great flavor, we especially liked the cumin/cilantro combo. Made on the grill, delish. We&#039;ll certainly make this again."
107135,499920,2014/7/10,5,"1st off your picture is better than mine, it always is .lol this bread rocks and if you have some raspberry jam try it  i didnt use that much chocolate and it was ok   . it rises great .i used 4 bananas"
47892,517653,2014/8/5,4,I prefer fruited tea iced rather than hot but I did test the recipe both manners. Earl Grey bergamot scented black tea was chosen and I used my homemade Rainier cherry freezer jam. The tea was strained after adding the jam to remove any fruit peel pieces. Made for Culinary Quest. Thanks for posting! It was different and refreshing!
1802892051,517653,2014/8/12,5,"Gee, I want CG to send me some of that homemade jam!  This was really good....I usually drink my tea black.  But in this, the jam kept it from being too strong/harsh/bitter and the lemon kept the jam from making it too sweet. ;)  Made for my fellow Cruisin&#039; Culinary Queen/Culinary Quest 2014.  xo Beth/elmotoo"

67728,517653,2014/9/25,5,"I had to sit and work on DH&#039;s landscaping billing this morning, and this lovely cup of tea made it a more pleasant experience, thank you very much! I never would&#039;ve thought to sweeten tea with preserves, but this is a brilliant way to use up those last little bits of preserves that are taking up space in the fridge. I drink quite a bit of hot tea in the colder months, so I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be making this often. Thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest I Family Picks"
2000716595,525003,2015/12/2,5,Easy to make and so delicious!
2000716596,525003,2015/12/2,5,Awesome!
2000689016,525003,2015/12/2,5,Looks delicious!!
254614,504520,2013/7/25,4,this is delicious. you have to go to a specialty market to get salted cod.
179133,501086,2013/7/20,5,"I made a vegetarian version of this for my lunch today with an eggplant from my garden and it was delicious! :) I used a small eggplant (Black Beauty variety; was not quite 1/2 lb), diced &amp; tossed with olive oil. Cooked in a nonstick skillet until browned &amp; soft, then tossed with lime juice, pom molasses, za&#039;atar, salt &amp; pepper (forgot the garlic, darn it!) all to taste. Served with diced cucumber, tomato, basil, mint &amp; lettuce - all from the garden too - and greek yogurt (dang it, forgot the green onion also!) I have more eggplants growing so expect I will make this again soon! Thanks for sharing! :)"
266635,501086,2013/9/20,5,"These tacos are absolutely delicious! What a wonderful idea for tacos -- love the pomegranate molasses and sumac.  Used white corn tortillas and made a garnish platter with cucumber, avocado, tomatoes, red onion and basil.  These tacos will be on my menu often -- so healthy and flavorful. Adding to my Best of 2013 Cookbook for sure. Made for the NA/ME tag, September, 2013."
169430,501086,2015/6/22,5,"I made two taco&#039;s for my dinner a short while back. Used ground beef (what I had) and Zatar seasoning as I had just made fresh batch of it. Veggies of choice were: olives, diced tomato, green leaf lettuce and fresh mint. Topped with yogurt with a bit more Zatar in it for a really yummy change of pace."
126440,503901,2013/7/20,4,Made half a recipe for the two of us and turned out very good.
482376,503901,2013/7/22,5,Great and healthy salad! My husband and daughter thought the chicken was very flavorful. I enjoyed the toppings on the salad. Thanks! Made for ZWT9 and the Soup-A-Stars
329769,503901,2013/9/1,5,Reviewed for ZWT9 Family Picks - a lovely grilled chicken salad that we all enjoyed
329769,495318,2013/3/1,4,This was an easy dish to make and a good budget friendly meal. I would have liked more sauce and perhaps a little thicker. Using gluten-free ketchup makes this an easy gluten-free meal.Good luck in the competition
220348,495318,2013/3/1,5,"I also had a very thin sauce with this recipe, but I actually kind of liked it. It was kind of sticky, but it was finger licking good. And it reminds me of summer barbequing, which is something I am looking forward to. I was just sad it went too quickly."
160977,495318,2013/3/1,4,"Easy to make and good taste. Yes, the sauce was a bit thin but that did not matter. It was good mixed with the rice. <br/>Thanks for creating, posting and good luck in the competition.<br/>Made for Dining on a Dollar, Spring 2013."
286566,495318,2013/10/30,4,"The chicken had wonderful flavour and was moist and fall off the bone after baking at 175C fan forced for 50 minutes but our only disappointment was there was no sauce to put over the rice, also normally I would use a sugar free maple syrup but couldn&#039;t get any so used the real deal and paid for it with high blood sugars so know not to do that again.  So would make again but with sugar free maple syrup and reserve some of the sauce to pour over the rice, thank you Satyne, made for Photo Tag tag game under the 24 hour rule."
145352,502882,2013/7/30,5,This was a simple dish to make. My favorite part by far was the pineapple jalapeno salsa. There was plenty leftover to have with chips! Made for ZWT 9!
280271,502882,2013/9/13,5,Delicious! This was easy to prepare...I used canned pineapple...otherwise I followed the recipe...my daughter and grandson loved it so much that she asked for the recipe...we really enjoyed the salsa...I left the jalapeno&#039;s out of my 4 year old grandsons serving...this is going in my keeper file...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
2000636027,524328,2015/11/4,5,Yummy!!
599450,505729,2013/8/17,5,"Fast and furiously delicious! Even picky DH loves this and complemented me on it the next morning! Made as directed. Thanks, Dienia! You are becoming DH&#039;s favorite &#039;Zaar chef! Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
480195,505729,2013/8/20,5,"This was so good! I doubled the recipe and substituted julienned zucchini, as I had no green beans on hand. The combination of flavors was just perfect. This has gone into my binder of favorites, to be made again and again. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
452355,505729,2013/8/26,5,"This is an easy, flavorful fish recipe.  I doubled the sauce to accommodate 1 lb of fish; however,  I think the original sauce proportions, as posted, would have worked fine on a pound of fish without doubling.  I used 5 serrano chile peppers from my garden, seeded, which was not too much heat for us.  I combined that and the garlic in my mini food processor.  DH grilled the fish and this worked out great.  We served with Recipe #473793.  Made for ZWT9"
2728063,496754,2013/3/8,5,This recipe looks delicious - and so easy to make!
2702188,524815,2015/11/25,5,This dish is amazing. So easy to make and the whole family loved it. Perfect for a cold winter evening.
2000721380,524815,2015/11/30,5,most excellent
2123645,534802,2018/3/12,4,"This is very spicy, but pretty good. The recipe directions weren't quite complete, so I guessed how to make the recipe and submitted how I did the last few steps. You will want to use a very large skillet or a stock pot. I love the idea of using the shrimp shells to make broth. It worked pretty well. If you don't like your food too spicy, you might want to reduce the Cajun seasoning quite a bit. I added about 1/2 teaspoon salt to suite my taste."
2002259490,534802,2018/8/27,5,"I am from New Orleans and this is spot ON! I had never used jalapeno before, though; always cayenne pepper. This actually made it spicier but better. The only tweaks I made was I used smoked sausage and browned it in the pan for flavor, more garlic because I am a garlic nut, and a bit more shrimp because I had to increase the recipe for another guest. I added home-made chicken bone broth to richen the flavor and adding fluid back after losing some when simmering the shrimp stock. I added a little butter and olive oil for macros when I made the second round of veggies. And a little xanthan gum in the end tothicken because I didn't have guar. Trust me, all these changes didn't make the dish, Morgan's original recipe gave me a GREAT base. I just built on it from my usual recipe."
2002272232,534802,2018/9/12,4,"I am not sure what I did, but it turned out super spicy (and I Love spicy), but it was to the point where I did not have to add any Cajun spices to the gumbo itself. I am wondering, if the jalapenos were meant to be cooked in the broth or used as a garnish at the end. I cooked them in the broth so that may have done it. I would also consider adding a riced cauliflower as the dish needs tends to be one texture. Also, be careful with that Guar Gum...a little goes a LONG way. I would make this again however as the shrimp take on a great flavor and I would learn from this batch."
227978,533130,2017/8/13,5,"I made a batch of these for some friends and I to enjoy on the deck on a steamy hot afternoon, and everyone really enjoyed them. I thought it was good and would probably order it at a bar. But everyone else really raved about them and had another. It has a slight citrus tang to it, but the cumin added a captivating touch, which is interesting because I would never have though to include cumin in a cocktail, but it really worked well though. Thanks, momaphet. We enjoyed these, and your recipe went home with a few of my friends! Made for Culinary Quest 2017 (Himalayas)."
2429704,507883,2015/3/15,1,"I started to make this recipe without really looking at the thoroughly....big mistake! No eggs, no baking soda. Tried a couple of cookies.. bad. then added soda and eggs. Made a much better cookie. I suggest not making this without adding eggs, soda and cocoa as the  cookies turn out an odd blue color. UHG. Flavorful but ugly to look at."
2000242707,507883,2015/6/2,4,I haven't made these yet but they sound delicious! Will be trying. 
128473,502510,2017/1/19,5,"Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe Lazy. I made 1/2 the recipe for the two of us, it was perfect. The chowder was quick and easy to make with excellent results. It was thick and hearty and full of flavor with great textures. We loved it. I will be making it often. Made for First Time Tag"

386585,504781,2013/9/3,5,"Super delicious soup that is pretty easy to prepare, although a little time-consuming.  Your patience will be rewarded, however!  I made this exactly as posted and enjoyed a truly flavorful soup that had quite a nice kick to it.  The only thing I did differently was to use an immersion blender directly in the soup pot to pure half of the soup.  The texture is just perfect and I will definitely make this again.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
2000117610,499252,2015/4/5,5,"This had the perfect amount of spice for the lamb, and the peas had just the right pop.  I served it over white rice, and my picky husband and 3-yr old son both gobbled it up!"
204024,493551,2013/3/21,5,I really liked this goulash.  I served it with sharp cheddar and they worked great together.  Made for PAC 2013 spring.
2000376014,523840,2017/1/23,5,Easy to make. Tastes fantastic.
482376,492971,2013/11/13,5,"Simple and absolutely delicous! My husband really loved this recipe. The only change I made = using boneless/skinless chicken breasts. I sliced the breasts through the middle so the breast pieces would be thin. The sauce is excellent. I have always made piccata with butter and capers. This version was just as delicious in a different way. I loved the green onions. I&#039;ll be making this easy, quick recipe again and again. Made in the memory of pammyowl."
2304555,521591,2017/2/22,5,Yummy! My family loved it!
383346,509656,2014/2/28,4,This was so easy to do on a weeknight.  I used a leftover of marinara sauce.  It was a good meal that I served with green beans and rice.  Thanks Jenny :)  Made for PRMR tag game
2324285,498387,2013/5/28,5,"This tasted much different that I expected, but I enjoyed it.  The fried garlic, chard, and lemon juice are a perfect flavor combination, and the beef was almost melt-in-your mouth tender.  I could not taste the nutmeg, allspice or cinnamon at all though...  didn&#039;t know what purpose it served in the stew.  I have to say, I&#039;m definitely looking forward to trying more Palestinian food now."
145352,502988,2013/7/14,5,I really enjoyed this!!! The feta and zucchini made for a very moist burger. Made for ZWT 9.
80353,502988,2013/9/2,5,"Delicious burger, much enjoyed by the entire family.  I upped the quantities by a bit to get 5 burgers, and grated the zucchini instead of leaving it in bits.  The beef being so lean, the zucchini adds much-need moisture."
135470,502988,2016/8/20,5,"This was a great burger with so many flavors going on, my DH said he liked it better than the burger at our fav Tom Douglas restaurant which he loves! I didn't read the recipe right and ended up putting lemon juice and cucumber in the burger as well as in the yogurt mix. I was surprised by how much I loved the yogurt topping. I used a regular bun instead of sourdough roll. Made for Culinary Quest 3 for one of the Iota Eta Pi"
2549237,507128,2013/10/17,5,"Thank you for uploading this wonderful recipe!  We really enjoyed this meal and it was very simple to make.  I started everything on the stove top and the transferred it to the crockpot to let it simmer for about 4 hours (because you said it is better the longer it cooks).  I came home from an outting with friends and the house smelled like my home growing up.  I served this over Whole Wheat Linguine with Garlic Bread and our whole family devoured it.  I did take pictures, but am unable to upload them until my laptop is repaired.  I will come back in a few days and post them.  Thanks so much Deantini!  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag *Fall 2013*."
169430,507128,2013/10/17,5,I made a double batch of this today and after a sampling for lunch on spaghetti I bagged the rest for the freezer. This is the time of year that I make soups and such for over wintering on the easy. I replaced the wine with beef broth out of personal preference but aside from that followed the recipe. Got 9 bags with enough for two servings (for us) each. The sauce is delicious and will be appreciated all winter long. :D
2001085744,519764,2018/5/11,5,Excellent combination. I love your recipe~!
323186,494677,2013/10/23,5,"Very quick, simple and delicious, what a pleasure!!!   I used multi-coloured rotini for a eye-pleasing result.  Although I didnt use the actual product suggested here (since we dont get it in this country), I used equivalent products and I&#039;m sure to equally delicious effect!

1802678451,532651,2018/4/18,0,Okay what do you do with the egg? Assuming you dip the cauliflower in the egg first then the dry mix?
2001992595,532651,2018/9/21,1,"This recipe suffers from a serious lack of directions. It may a great dish, but these directions will definitely not get you there... how did this ever got onto the &quot;most popular&quot; list? Please fix, ASAP!"

323186,503092,2013/8/7,5,"Very much enjoyed this colourful and slightly spicy dish, easily prepared, I like cabbage and always good to find a new way to prepare it!    Thank you Dienia, made for ZWT9"
1803425921,503092,2014/12/31,5,"Quick, inexpensive, healthy, and tasty... I couldn&#039;t ask for more. It&#039;s delicious with rice &amp; peas. I will probably always cook my cabbage like this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tip: I always add salt and pepper to taste because cabbage (like potatoes) sucks up the pepper and salt pretty easily."
2000073716,503092,2015/3/19,5,"fabulous! I didn&#039;t have carrots so I used a half a small sweet potato, peeled and shredded. Also used chicken broth instead of water, and a little more allspice. Absolutely amazing with Jamaican rice and peas and pan fried jerk chicken thighs."
2000287720,503092,2015/6/22,0,"I have made this recipe twice and both times I got great reviews. It is easy, inexpensive to make and very tasty.  I even liked it cold. Thank you 
I had it with Chicken Apple sausage from sprouts and it was great together"

2001765171,503092,2017/10/25,5,it turned absolutely fine it was delicious especially with some extra spice at the side of a hot chicken curry and a cup of lemonade
761708,503092,2017/11/7,5,"Great recipe! Per Tricia M.'s suggestion, I used chicken broth instead of water. It was delicious. Thanks, Dienia B., for sharing this recipe with us!"
2002201735,503092,2018/6/29,4,Made this last night to go with Brown Stew Chicken and cornbread. It was fantastic. I used sliced carrot instead of shredding them. That's what my local Jamaican place does and I prefer it.
2001133740,503092,2018/7/9,5,This is a great recipe for steamed cabbage. The spices give it a nice kick and both my wife and I ate it with gusto. Good work.
1052873,503619,2013/8/28,4,The mango/cilantro was great but I overcooked the fish. The spices did not stick to the fish well; maybe next time put the spices in the oil. Made for ZWT9.
68904,509963,2013/12/5,5,I love these and make them every year for xmas but I am disappointed that nestle does not make the swirled chips any longer....they looked the best! I have also made for baby showers by coloring the dough pink and adding white chips.
2000183019,521693,2015/5/3,5,"This recipe is delicious.  I usually purchase Aunt Nellies, but the taste of these beats that brand.  Two thumbs up!"
2756448,496400,2013/3/27,5,Yum!!
2000510435,523750,2015/10/1,5,"Wow...this is really great! I was surprised at how good it tasted, considering how low in calories it is. Next time, I&#039;m skipping the McDonald&#039;s drive-thru!"
163112,504007,2014/4/1,5,"Hallelujah!   This is magnificent!  Aleppo has a wee kick that is absolutely fabulous.  I did use canned (not marinated) hearts.  The fresh were yukky &amp; frozen non existent.  Every so often, I&#039;d notice a sweetness &amp; think YUM!  What is that?  The tarragon!  You don&#039;t really taste the tarragon but it lends a subtle sweetness that will make you swoon.  I love the flavors in this dressing...all my faves, lol.  What a nice way to dress up artichoke hearts!  Made for Spring 2014 NA/ME Tag."

2002240729,501315,2018/8/6,0,It’s ‘Samoa’ not ‘Somoa’ ??. Love this recipe from Samoafood.com though!
2001414110,512482,2017/3/2,5,"Thank you, Rita, for this awesome recipe. I was looking for it as I need to reinforce my gut. Very easy and fun to prepare. I used all organic veggies, French &quot;Sel de Gerande&quot; and Fiji water. It turned out delicious and beautiful. I've already shared the recipe with friends and family. Great as a side dish, a snack or anytime you check your fridge. A keeper!"
2001884748,525190,2017/12/24,0,"Recipe should be 3 and 1/4 cup sugar, not 3/4 cup. You will not be able to cook to soft ball stage without burning and the result will be a soft frosting consistency if you stop when it begins to burn"
498271,511448,2014/4/16,5,I have to start this review by saying I have never been able to make a decent pie crust! ;) That being said this one came out pretty good and I will definitely make it again.  I used the food processor method.  The dough seemed a bit sticky and I don&#039;t think I rolled it thin enough but it still came out pretty flaky and quite tasty so a good accomplishment for me!  Used this to make your recipe #511463 and we really enjoyed it - thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2014
1195222,511448,2015/3/27,1,Total waste of coconut oil. I&#039;ve never had trouble with pie crust. I tried this one out because I had a new jar of CO. It took an entire cup of water to get it to stick together when I rolled it out. At that point it was so tough that I gave up trying to roll it out.
2000258553,511448,2015/6/9,5,"I&#039;ve been making white flour piecrusts all my life, and was excited to try this healthier version.  I wasn&#039;t expecting much, but it was absolutley delicious!  Yes, the whole wheat flour is going to be little more challenging to work with, as it doesn&#039;t stick together as well as white flour.  Don&#039;t let that deter you: you just have to patch it up a little more as you get it into the pie plate.  I used the food processor method, and it really couldn&#039;t have been easier.  The crust looked charmingly rustic."
2000283503,511448,2015/6/20,1,"Two-thirds cup coconut oil to 2 cups flour almost made a batter so I added 2 more cups of flour. The first crust I rolled out completely fell apart, so I put it back in the bowl, crumbled it some more and added more water. I managed to get that one into the pie plate. The top crust held together better but I have little faith in the crust. It&#039;s in the oven at the moment and I have a feeling I&#039;ll have to cut it with a chisel as I&#039;ve had to do many times before with other whole wheat pie crusts. If by some miracle it turns out better than expected, I&#039;ll change this review. Luckily my sister taught me how to flute edges nearly 50 years ago, so at least it&#039;s not ugly, too."
865759,535602,2018/6/7,5,I’ve been looking for a simple easy recipe for scallops and now I have found it! Turned out great! Served over GF pasta with butternut squash...delicious!
1663024,496678,2014/11/8,5,"I eat salmon several times a week, and Chuckwagon Cookie&#039;s Pan Seared Crispy Skin Salmon is my favorite recipe for salmon! As your note mentioned, I made my own Citrus Spice Mix using 1 teaspoon of sea salt and &frac12; teaspoon each of lemon pepper, dried orange peel, dried dill, garlic powder, and onion powder. Marinating the salmon for the recommended four hours in the refrigerator, infused the flavors of the Cajun seasoning and Citrus Spice Mix throughout the entire fillet. I increased the amount of lemon juice to one tablespoon and doubled the garlic and grape tomatoes. After two and a half minutes of stovetop searing, I only needed to roast my one-inch thick fillet of salmon for four and a half minutes in a 425F degree oven to finish it to perfection. Because a cast iron skillet is best way to sear a crispy outer crust on any cut of meat, it crisped the salmon&#039;s skin beautifully without overcooking its tender flesh. The grape tomatoes, shallots and garlic that dropped into the hot oil on the sides of the pan caramelized to be crisp and sweet. Thank you, ChuckWagonCookie, for a delicious recipe and no fail method to achieve crispy skin on salmon!"
1072593,496678,2015/9/14,5,Daughter made and I was like:  Look at me.  Look me in the eye.  Do you really believe I am leaving here without eating at least a bite this?  Because I&#039;m not.
126440,522598,2015/7/12,5,Absolutely delicious!  I have made this twice in the last week.  Made once as written and once with crispy beer fried tilapia.  Sauce is so good that DH has even been putting it on Italian bread and eating it that way.  A MUST try recipe.
2754289,497380,2013/3/25,5,Yummy yummy!! This combination is deelish!!!!! (I would use navy beans in place of the Black Eyed Peas)
2754689,497380,2013/3/26,0,Great  tasting recipe for someone trying their weight down!
2754443,497380,2013/3/26,5,"this dish is a good options to the usual black bean burger, I like the simplicity of the recipe and that is has lots of fiber in it, which means you don&#039;t need to eat a lot of them to fill full. This will be one of my go to recipes when I need a simple recipe that easy to fix. Thank you llwilson_88."
2755045,497380,2013/3/26,4,"Never would have tried potatoes and peas in this way. A great, tasty alternative to meat."
88099,507291,2014/4/13,5,"When I first looked at this recipe I thought first off that I&#039;d use this and use that but because it was the first time I&#039;ve made it and the first review I decided (thankfully) to make as written, which I did.  I would not change a thing about this recipe.  If you love grits, which I do, you need to try this recipe.  Just delicious and could be used as a side for many things.  We&#039;re having it with fish tonight.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
137302,496512,2013/4/17,3,"This marinade was a bit of disappointing.  It didn&#039;t taste bad, it just didn&#039;t give as much flavor as I expected.  I had sliced the pork loin chops about 1/4 inch thick and marinaded the meat for 24 hours.  I told my DH to basically lightly brown both sides on both sides and not to cook too long since the slices were thin.  I didn&#039;t want the meat to become tough or overdone.  It still was slightly pink in the middle and was not dry, but it wasn&#039;t as tender or as flavorful as I expected.  I did cook the marinade as suggested but didn&#039;t think it was as great as posted.  I was hoping that it would be a good substitute for a professionally sold Pineapple marinade, but didn&#039;t quite reach to that level.  Perhaps a little bit more &#039;heat&#039; or other seasonings would give a boost to the flavor.  Made for PAC Spring 2013."
764068,522243,2015/6/19,5,Very tasty. I did not add the fresh garlic or the scallions; since I did not have any on hand. I just added onion and garlic powder. Thank you for posting!

452355,501143,2013/10/3,5,These brussels sprouts were fantastic!  They were easy to prepare and so flavorful.  I liked what I sampled in the pan before even adding them to the onion mix.  This is going into my keeper file.  Thanks so much!  Made for Every Day is a Holiday tag.
37449,501143,2013/10/20,5,Very yummy! I used red onion in place of shallots. Enjoyed and will make again. Thanks!
542159,501143,2013/12/3,5,"A debate ensued as to who would get the few that were left, does that tell you how they went over? These were not only very flavorful but I really liked how quick they cooked being sliced up, also liked the color and texture brought about by slicing them. Thanks for the wonderful post."
131021,501143,2014/4/19,4,We liked these a lot but I just wasn&#039;t really fond of the sweet and sour flavor. I loved the method and would like to use it in the summer when I don&#039;t want to turn the oven on to roast veggies. I used finely chopped onion instead of shallots and would love to try it again with some garlic instead of sugar and vinegar.
204024,515434,2014/8/24,5,We enjoyed this as past of Italian feast.  Loved the combination of flavors.  It is amazing how the anchovies break apart and blend in.   Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
482376,515434,2014/8/27,5,"I can see why this it your go-to puttanesca recipe! It&#039;s easy to put together and tastes great. I really loved the slight anchovy taste (not so much a taste as it is a slightly salty flavor boost), capers and olives. Yummy combination. I quartered the recipe because I made this for my lunch. I still have enough for one more lunch! Thank you. Made for Culinary Quest Italy - International Agents of Quest."
2000374849,521731,2015/7/31,5,Outstanding!!!! Finally a recipe that gives chicken a great flavor. I used 1/2 the oil and only 1/4 c  colby cheese and 1/4 parm cheese added more fresh basil...Very low calorie ...Thanks ever so much...!
114027,503959,2013/7/27,4,"This recipe is great idea, and has some good flavor, but I felt like it was missing something. I think there needs to be more depth in the gravy, it seemed like most of the flavor came from salt and the tomatoes tasted like they came right out of the can. I&#039;m not saying this to be harsh on the recipe because I really did enjoy it, I just think next time I will cook the gravy for a lot longer and maybe blend the tomatoes a little before serving. Made for The Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT 9."
1925885,505443,2013/8/15,3,"Well, that was interesting! I chose this recipe because I had a partial bottle of grape juice in the fridge and didn&#039;t know what to do with it.  I did like the drink - the orange water really changes it up, and my only complaint is that it was too sweet.  I used honey, but only a touch because grape juice is already way sweet. If I do have this again, I&#039;ll probably try to lighten it up a little bit with some soda water to tone it down. Thanks for posting a quite unusual recipe!  Made for ZWT9."
107135,505443,2013/8/18,5,"i didnt add as much orange water. start low guys lol , i did like a little in there,very much.and a touch of honey  and a pinch of cinnamon  really bumps up the frozen  stuff , make this one zwt9"
80353,505443,2013/8/21,4,"I used a local grape juice.  Like a previous reviewer, I felt the grape juice was already sweet enough and, though I only used half the amount of honey called for, felt it really didn&#039;t need any added sweetener.  Loved the additions of orange flower water and cinnamon."
383346,505443,2013/8/22,5,"Very yummy but sweet. But it was perfect for my son.  He doesn&#039;t like grape juice a lot.  But with these additions, he likes it.  Yesterday he asked me to do another one for him.  Thanks Cookgirl.  Made for ZWT9"
226867,505443,2013/9/2,5,"I used home-made grape juice sweetened with Splenda when I canned it and added NO additional sweeteners based on other reviews. This was so good!  I ordered the Orange Blossom juice a couple weeks ago and it didn&#039;t come in time for the ZWT9 Moroccan leg of the event, but now I was able to try it for ZWT9 Family Picks!"
163112,505443,2013/9/3,5,"YUM!  The honey had a hard time blending in so I was thinking (uhoh!) that....you could heat some of the juice, add honey &amp; stir until dissolved.  Add the cinnamon stick to that &amp; let it steep a bit before adding the whole but back to the rest of the juice &amp; adding the orange flower water.  But, I don&#039;t think the additional sweetener is really needed.  I accidentally added way more ground cinnamon which turned out great &amp; the recommended amount of orange flower water I could barely detect.  (because of too much cinnamon?)  so I added more.  YUMMM.  I sipped &amp; sipped...finished the whole quart in a day.  ;)  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
169430,505443,2016/1/12,5,I made half of this and didn&#039;t use any of the sweetening. Grape juice has enough on it&#039;s own I think. Loved the orange water and cinnamon addition&#039;s. I might also add that since it&#039;s January in Canada I heated mine and enjoyed it hot. :D
679953,505026,2014/4/9,5,"Well Annacia.. this is one great recipe.. forget the calories.  I used the extract, and followed the recipe right down the line.  The (hotness) was just right with the cold ice cream, and worked out well. Had takeout  due to  a highschool  baseball game,and was read when we got home. It sure beat going out for some too. Easy as  can be, and very inexpensive.  )"
169430,494408,2014/5/22,5,I used Sea Bass and subbed in white wine vinegar as I don&#039;t have rice wine vinegar. I simply loved the flavors here and the low calorie hit wasn&#039;t hard to take either. DH didn&#039;t even take a bite but that&#039;s just his natural super finickiness and no surprise. I&#039;m rating this on my opinion and I loved it! The beautiful fresh tomato&#039;s and kalamata  olives (what I have) paired very well. Yum!

383346,506356,2013/10/7,5,"This is so yummy.  I made it only for me with 2 small apples.  Of course, we have to use firm apples.  It was a great dessert.  Thanks Bonnette :)  Made for PRMR tag game"
80353,508013,2014/9/2,5,"Nobody would believe it if I told them that Toolbet Diva MAILED me a cedar plank years back so that I could make her planked salmon recipe, but she really did and I still have it (although it shows a lot of wear and tear).  I brought it out from the depths of a cupboard and soaked it to use in this recipe, and I made a great choice!  The salmon was delicious in its marinade/sauce, and the potato mash had a great &#039;bite&#039; from the mustard.  LOVED this for dinner."
266635,508013,2017/9/19,5,Made this delicious salmon tonight for dinner. I did not have the cedar plank so we baked it without one. I scaled the recipe down quite a bit as we were only making two 6 oz portions. DH raved about the salmon as the it turned out really nice and flavorful.
242766,505615,2013/8/23,5,"With the rum and spices, this drink is reminiscent of eggnog except with a tropical flair.  We enjoyed this as an after dinner drink and it was almost like a dessert.  It went together very quickly and easily. I simply whipped it up in a blender with some crushed ice...yummy!  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!  Made for ZWT 9 - SE Asia for The Apron String Travelers."
177443,496094,2013/3/4,5,"Five stars for ease of prep! This is a nice creamy pasta dish, that went together super quick and easy. Made ours with a mix of both spinach and regular cheese tortellini, along with leftover balsamic chicken tenders and sugar snap peas (from last nights dinner), and sprinkled with sliced green onions over the top. Thought it would be nice with a little salt & pepper or maybe some lemon thyme added, may try that next time. We enjoyed with a glass of chilled chardonnay. Thanks AZ!"

These are a new staple in our home, thanks so much for the yummy post."

125411,492732,2013/4/7,5,"Amazingly delicious. My husband and I eat a ketogenic diet and this fit the bill perfectly. I had to substitute a sprinkle of xanthum gum to replace the flour, and used heavy cream instead of milk. That pretty much kicked extra carbs to the curb. The next morning I reheated the leftovers and served with poached eggs. Even better, if that&#039;s possible! This is one of the recipes here that I find to be restaurant quality.

This one was very simple in design but a little more interesting when i added sesame oil( one tsp for a double batch), a quarter of a small yellow onion minced, a pinch of cayenne, some mexican oregano and more ginger. I use chicken broth(Better than Boullioun) in many of my dishes for more depth and pronounced flavor so when I saw that you went the same route as I I knew it was going to be good...I saved a mason jar of the &quot;gravy&quot; since it will enhance other Hawaiian, Filipino and Japanese creations..I served the chicken with rice and Mac' n' Cheese with Edamame and Shiitake mushrooms(not much) topped with breadcrumbs... I Loved it..Sometimes I can taste the dish just by reading the ingredients!

2002136529,519326,2018/4/30,5,"LOVE THIS BREAD!!! Now up front I wanna say we use Honey in place of molasses, but it turns out fantastic! Also added Chia seeds and trying other seeds as well. We have been big fans of Dave's Killer Bread, the Good Seed version. We were looking for a home recipe and my wife found this. One try and we are HOOKED! We even bought a covered 13x4x4 covered pan for the bread from Amazon, &quot;USA Pan Bakeware Pullman Loaf Pan with Cover&quot; But it fits perfectly in this pan and never sticks! This bread has turned out really good each of the three times we have made it so far and are going to try some neat ideas with it the next few times.. different nuts, and maybe after rolling it out tossing in a layer of cinnamon-sugar and rolling it up! But it really makes bread that, quite frankly, makes Dave's Bread kinda plain now... Dave is a good fallback if we haven't made this, but Dave could learn something from this recipe!! It's THAT Good! BTW, we mix it up using a KitchenAid 6 quart mixer that powers through the mixing quite well. Amazing to watch that dough hook turn out a nice ball of dough in a few minutes, and sooooo glad I'm not pounding out the dough by hand! Will never have to do that by hand again. (I'm Done with bread machines. Too limiting.) If you do a lot of breads, the KitchenAid is WORTH EVERY PENNY! For this bread it's made it awesome too!"
1802788263,519326,2018/8/17,5,This was fantastic! It looks like a great recipe for experimenting with different nuts and seeds.

228458,504111,2013/8/26,5,"This was very easy and very yummy, and a great use of harissa (which I only just discovered and LOVE). My kids loved the carrots, especially. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
131126,504111,2013/8/26,5,I only made the carrots &amp; thought they were wonderful. I used a mandolin to cut the strips and a contact grill which made easy work.  The flavors are different and so good paired with the sweet carrots. I&#039;ll definitely be making this again! Served with Pan Seared Moroccan Salmon for ZWT9.
323186,504111,2013/8/26,5,"Extremely easy and very tasty,  I do like new ways of doing veggies, especially zucchini, which always seem to be available and affordable here!   Thankyou Cookgirl, made for ZWT9, Pink Panthers"
266635,504111,2013/11/6,5,"We absolutely love grilled veggies and with our indoor grill (but grilled outdoors to lessen the smoke), it&#039;s quick and easy to make them.  I used a harissa recipe found on this site that is less spicy than most -- it imparts a lot of flavor, but not a huge amount of heat.  This dish turned out really good and I&#039;ll certainly make it again!  Made for NA/ME, November, 2013."
1925885,501463,2013/7/15,5,"Oh, my! Definitely five stars!!!  The bread pudding was delicious, and the sauce amazing!  I cut down the pudding recipe to 4 servings, and the sauce to only two servings - which was more than enough to pool lots of sauce on each serving.  I used some homemade banana liqueur and I think it makes a big difference, as it has much more flavor than the commercial ones.  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT9."
1803607841,513606,2015/1/3,4,"I would also add celery bay leaves and brown sugar. Also use chicken broth instead of water. Yum, delicious. Whole house will smell devine. :)"
1803322077,510915,2017/1/2,5,This is pretty much the only way I make ham anymore. So easy and good. Thanks for posting.
2668180,494515,2013/2/8,5,Delicious and easy!
2667917,494515,2013/2/8,5,Delicious combination of flavors!  Will definitely make again.
2683326,494515,2013/2/8,5,Yummy!!!
2684581,494515,2013/2/9,5,So delicious and easy!
2684792,494515,2013/2/9,5,So good - I want it for every meal!
2668181,494515,2013/2/9,5,Very good!
2667997,494515,2013/2/11,5,Yummo!!!!
2694923,494515,2013/2/15,5,Delicious!
161282,505028,2013/8/14,4,"Very tasty, and yes--simple! The mix and brown sugar combine to make a nice little sauce. My boyfriend said it reminded him of Stouffer&#039;s honey-glazed chicken. Thanks for sharing!"
136997,505028,2013/10/16,4,Couldn&#039;t be any simpler and tasty to boot. I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs. They have much more flavor and stand up to a longer cooking time.
1801593485,505028,2013/12/30,5,"My husband&#039;s favorite chicken was chicken tetrazzini which is a 2 day preparation, I made this last week and this is his new favorite. Easy, easy, easy and most importantly YUMMY!"
2697678,494515,2013/2/17,5,"Five stars for this amazing recipe, tried it for a dinner party on Friday and it was a HIT!"
2667986,494515,2013/2/18,5,The best shrimp I have ever had!!
2699636,494515,2013/2/18,5,This sounds delicious!
2001764837,531255,2017/10/24,0,It was great thanks
2000533648,531255,2017/10/24,4,"Tasted good, but I needed to add additional milk while melting the cheese. It probably totaled about one cup by the end. I used gemelli and it held the cheese well. Will make again."
2001415815,531255,2017/11/7,0,Delicious and creamy!
2001565779,531255,2017/11/26,0,It is best to melt the cheese off of the heat...i preferred to add more cheddar and skipped the mozzarella. Awesome!!!
2001952610,531255,2018/1/25,0,"hi all, just made the dish...super! added bacon fat and brown mushrooms...only had cheddar and cream cheese...they worked...going back for seconds...thanks for sharing this one. 5 stars in my book. dw"
329769,503134,2013/9/1,5,Reviewed for ZWT9 - enjoyed by all of my meat loving family :D
169430,503134,2015/11/21,5,"Aside from using some dried mint (no fresh available here) I just followed the recipe. I made half of it as DH wasn&#039;t interested in trying any and I loved them, his loss.  Excellent taste and quite easy to make and the flour coating was a nice touch. I&#039;m looking forward to having the leftovers soon. :D"
1802822367,514124,2014/6/14,3,"so close to open pit, but a bit too vinegar-y. next time, i&#039;ll decrease the vinegar, increase the ketchup, and i think it will be perfect! Thanks for a really close base to start with :)"
2001399452,514124,2017/2/20,4,I had to add more ketchup and brown sugar because it's too vinegar. Once I did that I really enjoyed it as well as my husband. Thank you so much!! I wanted a sauce tasting like open pit without gluten and this will be my go to. I will reduce the amount of vinegar though.
1037138,495330,2013/3/2,3,"I liked this recipe except for the maple syrup.  It was a bit overpowering for my taste.  I also reduced the amount of Pepsi because it would have made the mixture too runny had I added the full cup.  I ended up adding a generous half cup and the consistency of the mixture was great.  I did like the recipe otherwise and will use it after the contest with a few modifications.  I will not use the maple syrup and I will add onions and fresh minced garlic to the mix.  Pretty good, though!  Definitely a filling and quick meal."
128473,495330,2013/3/2,5,"My dh & I really enjoyed this tasty, quick and easy to make dish.  It was excellent, full of different flavors.  The sauce was wonderful, the meat was tender and the toasted bun was the perfect base for this lovely sandwich.  The ketchup was wonderful in this dish, prominent but not overpowering. Great use of contest ingredients, good luck in the contest."
1422300,495330,2013/3/3,5,"I like to see and make recipes with just the necessary ingredients to make a good dish, so I<br/>decided to make this tasty bbq sauce and we enjoy it with the beef sandwiches, so this is another favorite that will make again. I used ""Next"" Pepsi (with only 60 calories), add one chopped garlic clove instead of the garlic powder. Thanks for this recipe Chef, and good luck in the Dining of a Dollar Contest."
2597942,495330,2013/4/7,5,"Truly a delicious change of pace. The only things I did differently from the stated recipe, was I cut down the cola to 3/4 c and the maple syrup to 1 teaspoon (since I was using genuine maple syrup, not the squeeze bottle kind). I was afraid of it being too sweet. It turned out wonderful! I will definately make this again, it was very easy to prepare. I would suggest that you lightly freeze the meat for easier slicing, then cut it against the grain on a bias. Oh yes... I did chop the peppers and onions, browned them the same time along with the beef, and threw everything into the sauce to cook the entire 20 minutes. I served this on french rolls along with coleslaw and chips. Thank you for posting this recipe. I have it saved. (Made for PRMR - Spring 2013)"
2585084,495330,2013/5/8,5,"This was a delicious sandwich.  As a personal preference, I used a sweet red pepper.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  I loved the sauce. This tasty concoction was very good with crusty bread.  Thanks for posting this recipe."
199697,531143,2018/3/4,0,HI - the recipe looks nice - will try something like it - but 10 minute pad thai with the first direction to soak noodles for 20 minutes? Don'tcha think that is a bit of false advertising? Why not super quick pad thai?
2001247530,531143,2018/5/22,5,"Love this recipe! I've made it twice now, the first time exactly as written and the second time, doubling the recipe with a few changes. Exactly as written is amazing but a bit on the hot side for our tastes. The second time, I doubled the recipe using only 1 tbls of the chili paste and I added scallions at the end. Minor changes. This recipe is delicious, and so quick to prepare!!!"
2002108298,531143,2018/9/1,1,5 ingredients? I count 11. 10 min? No. 20 to 30 min. Prep time. Come on now!
383346,503431,2013/8/5,3,Unfortunately we didn&#039;t like it as much as we though we would.  I don&#039;t know why.  Or what could be added so we could like it more.  Thanks for posting Dreamer :)  Made for ZWT9
135470,503431,2013/8/11,5,Tart and delicious! I used  a combination of 100% Cranberry juice and 100% Pomegranate ( I grabbed the pom by mistake out of the fridge and started to use before I realized my mistake)
1925885,503431,2014/2/18,5,"Mm Mm Good!  I love Cosmo&#039;s, and this was really just a rum twist on that yummy drink.  It was really pretty in the glass and I know I&#039;ll be making many more of these on our warm and balmy evenings!  Thanks for posting!  Gourmet Goddesses ZWT9.  UPDATE February 2014. Still one of my all-time favorite cocktails!  Wish I could give it 10 stars.  Just updating to say that the better quality rum you use, the better it will taste. This afternoons version has a 10 year anejo and the drink is even better than ever. That caramelly-oak flavor shines right through and yet the drink remains tart and refreshing. Yum!!!"
323186,493900,2013/2/25,5,"Mikeykey,  this is soooo good!!!   I stuck to recipe other than two very minor changes, I did not use pre-cook lasagna sheets, just used the normal ones,  and I didnt use canned pupmkin puree,   I had fresh pumpkin, steamed, mashed and used that.   The goats cheese I used was a very soft and creamy peppadew-infused feta,  which worked very well in the recipe.    I cut myself a bit short on time and didnt let this stand for as long as it should ,  it still TASTED out of this world, but I would have got a better  -- shape?   by letting it stand,  this was a minor consideration however,   I LOVED this recipe and will definitely be making it again, I have also passed it on to friends!!!   Thanks so much, enjoyed for PRMR tag game"
653438,501116,2013/6/3,5,"Made as directed and these were so simple and delicious!  Great as a snack, appetizer or just for a meal with a salad.  I might add some mushrooms next time but thank you for posting.  Made for New Kids on the Block tag game 2013."
2597942,501116,2013/6/14,5,"I just finished making these. I was going to wait for lunch, but breakfast was calling to me. This is very similar to the way I normally make them... but I never did a tomato &amp; scallion version before. I made this, per recipe using tomato, for hubby... and made mine with scallion &amp; green bell pepper (I don&#039;t like tomato unless cooked to make a sauce). We both enjoyed these very much. I served them with sour cream on the side. Thanks for posting your simple and wonderful snack/lunch. (Made for &quot;New Kids&quot; tag)"
233583,501116,2013/6/27,5,"Mikekey!!  It doesn&#039;t get any easier than this.  I make similar but have not done the mater or the onions before.  Why I have no idea but let me say this is the bomb!!  I made this for my lunch yesterday using a ham steak sliced thin ( no deli for me allowed) a mater from neighbors garden organic and green onions from mine.  Wonderful. quick, nourishing, and flat out good.  I then made one for my neighbor, her mater after all, and she thought this was great. She couldn&#039;t believe I drove over on my lawn mower, plate in hand with a lunch for her.  It was pretty funny thinking about it but better than taking the car.  I am actually making these tonight again and cutting into quarters for an appy as a couple of the neighbors are  coming by for a stop in after dinner.  A bit of vino, some veggies, and your Quesadillas will do the trick. Thanks Mike I just love this variation."
67728,498165,2014/5/9,5,"I really liked this! Sweet-tart, icy and refreshing! This would be so good on a really hot summer day. I froze mine overnight, and it was scrapeable/scoopable right out of the freezer. I didn&#039;t have time to wait 45 minutes for thawing, so I&#039;m not sure yet if it becomes sippable slush, or if it stays scoopable, but either way is fine with me.  This is definitely going in my summer rotation, thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
323186,504715,2013/8/26,5,"Well, these were lovely carrots, sweet with a buttery glaze and a slight hint of spice, very nice, thank you Linky, made for ZWT9, Pink Panthers"
107135,504715,2013/8/26,5,"wow these were good,im not posting photo cause karen &#039;s amazing, just like these carrots try these zwt9"
114027,504715,2013/8/26,5,"Simple and delicious! I love dill and carrots together and the ginger was a nice addition to those flavors. Made for the Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT 9."
227978,504715,2014/10/26,5,"This was a great way to prepare carrots.  The dill and ginger added a nice touch, and the carrots were cooked to perfection--not too mushy and not too crunchy.  I wasn&#039;t sure what a grated orange ring is, so I just used a little grated orange peel.  But next time I&#039;ll leave that out as I didn&#039;t think the small amount I used seemed to matter much. Made for your win in the Football Pool."
2612444,504715,2014/12/10,5,"These really hit the spot. I used dehydrated orange peel and ginger powder and lots of dill. This is comfort food. Not bland at all. It really does &#039;glaze&#039; up.  I rarely post 5stars, but these are it."
246482,504715,2017/8/25,5,My husband who does not like carrots loved these Will make again for sure Made for CQ 2017
482376,504715,2017/8/29,5,Yum! These were great carrots! I loved the flavor and consistency. Very tasty. Thank you!
157425,504715,2017/9/2,5,"Loved these carrots! The carrots are sweet, spicy from the ginger with a bright flavor from the orange rind. Very easy to make and very delicious! Made for the Culinary Quest 2017 - Scandinavia."
266635,504715,2017/9/7,5,"DH isn't a carrot lover and I'm not overly fond of orange, but this carrot dish is truly delicious! Loved the hint of the orange and the sweetness of the carrots and bit of sugar. These carrots went great with our dinner tonight and they will definitely be a repeat at our house. Served with Swedish meatballs over noodles and marinated cucumbers in a sour cream sauce."
679953,495316,2013/3/4,5,"What do you bring to your neighbors house, along with 3 of his friends who is a firefighter ?  CHILI !!  So thats what I did.  Made this the slow cooker method.  Made this for 5 hungary men, during the hockey game.  I used sweet paprika, 2 chipotle chilies, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  This was nicely seasoned, and definately flavored to a tee.  I, myself did not care for the black-eyed peas, but everyone else did.  Great enough for 2 servings for each of us, and the rest of the guys really enjoyed this very unique recipe.  A couple of them had never tried black-eyed peas in chili, as I ran off (xeroxed) 4 extra copies of this recipe to them. Also had plenty of heat, but not overpowering.  I myself will try this in the future, halving the recipe, one stovetop, and one crockpot, one with the black-eyed peas, and one with out.  Excellent creation you have come up with, and good luck in the contest."
1706426,497918,2013/10/13,5,"Very tender and delicious! I have never used milk when making noodles before, but it worked just fine! Thanks for sharing, made for My Three Cefs 2013"
724631,497918,2013/12/26,4,"Great flavor. Why not put the instructions in the order they should be done?  It sounded so simple, so I followed the directions.  Either I needed to let the dough rest longer and/or I needed to sift more flour over the dough before rolling; after the first layer, my dough stuck together.  I cut my noodles thicker than usual so they might be easier to unroll.  Next time I will use my pasta machine and linguine roller/cutter as I normally would.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2000510987,497918,2016/9/20,5,I learned to read through the entire recipe previously with other recipes. The dough did come out a bit sticky before rolling but I wet my hands and had no problems taking it out of bowl to roll. I have made homemade noodles before but I learned to roll before cutting. Sharing her knowledge and experience was appreciated. My noodles were great tasting and so inexpensive. I've added the recipe with a how to paragraph to my recipes.
2001177368,497918,2016/9/21,0,"This is a great story behind this recipe, and I am very excited to try my hand at making noodles for the first time ever!!"
2001500478,512690,2017/4/21,5,"Oh my gosh, thank you for this wonderful little recipe! It turned out awesome! I really appreciate the flexibility to accommodate different tastes and pantries. I even tried a double batch cooked in a little casserole for 4 minutes. That gave bigger slices I could toast. YUM! I CAN have my Paleo and eat bread too!"
47892,501957,2013/9/14,5,These were most delicious and easy to make. I used local grass fed beef (although lamb would be equally good or in combination) and fresh heirloom tomatoes from our CSA box. I reduced the amount of tomatoes to 2 pounds however. Made a Syrian baharat spice mix blend from a recipe found online somewhere. The meatballs were served over plain couscous accompanied by a simple tossed green salad. Will make again! Made for A Taste of Syria in the NA*ME forum.
107135,505518,2013/8/17,5,"simple , good tasting zwt9"
136997,505248,2013/8/13,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed. I used frozen shredded hash browns that needed to be used up, ham and  Jack cheese. Since I like the flavor of fresh parsley, I used it at the end of the cooking time. Made for New Kids on the Block Tag Game. :)"
61796,505248,2013/11/13,5,"I made this for a bunch of teenages for an early morning scripture study class.  Only had one student out of six not like it, and she &quot;doesn&#039;t eat eggs&quot;.  One boy liked it so much he asked for the recipe.  It&#039;s really hearty, warm, and protein-packed.  I also love how easy it is to make and take to feed a crowd.  I&#039;ll do it again for sure."
169430,506064,2014/9/24,5,"I had frozen squid bodies and can tell you that if you want to cut them into nice circles don&#039;t let them fully defrost. I kind of forgot about then while defrosting and my rings weren&#039;t as niece as I would have liked. Aside from that this turned out very well indeed. I had no problem following the recipe and dinner was delicious. Mine took less time to cook than stated (I might have cut them too small?) so be sure to keep a close eye on them as you really don&#039;t want them overcooked. I only made a single serving for myself which could certainly effect the cooking time too. Anyway, It was quite easy to make and company worthy. So glad I made this for Culinary Quest 2014."
169430,508424,2014/12/26,5,"I just found the perfect reason to buy more butternut, This side was really the hit of Christmas dinner and the ideal side for baked ham. I made the full recipe and 3 of us nearly wiped it all out. There ia a small amount left that I let everyone know was for a side to my ham sandwich at the next day. The flavors are amazing together and the fresh cranberries tart nip is just so darn good with the squash and the Gala apples that I used, I&#039;ve printed this recipe because it will most certainly be made again.  You just can&#039;t go wrong with this. Thank you Nancy. :D"
599450,503985,2013/7/22,5,"This is so yummy and so easy to make. Even picky DH who doesn&#039;t care for cooked oysters enjoyed this omelet. Thanks, fellow Gourmet Goddess, Pesto lover! Made for ZWT9."

2030686,496430,2016/5/3,5,"I made this for my teenage boys several years ago and they loved it! They are 25 and 20 now and they just said, &quot;remember that Asian Spinach Steak Salad you made a couple times. Will you make it again&quot;? I've seen different versions of this, but remembered it was a Cat Cora video recipe I saw when I first made it and I wanted it to be the same. Glad I found this Food.com! Thanks!"
139381,506589,2013/9/4,5,"I can tell you right off the bat, this is the exact recipe that my mother used.  I have found it fail-proof, and right up to her standards.  I spent years trying to make &quot;her&quot; biscuits.  This is a &quot;spot on&quot; method.  Thanks for posting!!!!"
107135,513683,2014/8/6,5,love this breakfast   its easy peasy  and good to use with left over coffee lol made for southern leg  cake pops on parade
226863,513683,2014/8/14,5,This brings back memories of my mother in law.  She made country ham and tomato gravy quite often.  This is a little different though...but still delish.  Made for Culinary Quest Summer 2014.
2597942,499174,2013/6/12,4,"June 06, 2013: I made this dish and served it with my garlic studded pork roast. Hubby and I both enjoyed it, and it was quite simple to make. I am only  rating it 4**** because I would not choose to use a tiny &quot;pinch&quot; of red pepper flakes if I make this again (and I&#039;m sure I will). I thought the red pepper flakes took away the taste of the pasta, garlic &amp; parm, but someone may like the heat. I think it would be better without,  but I wanted to stay true to the recipe. Also, your instructions do not say what to do with the garlic cloves (chop, mince, leave whole etc...)  or when to add the 1/4 c of parm (I used the shaker can of parm because it didn&#039;t specify that either). So I chopped and sweat the garlic and pepper flakes, then added the parm with the spaghetti (mine didn&#039;t get creamy). My garlic bulb did not have the green shoots, but I did sprinkle the top with additional parsley. Thank you for posting your recipe and giving me inspiration. (Made for Name That Ingredient tag). UPDATE: I used the left-overs  to make chicken noodle soup (for a cooking deconstruction challenge in the &quot;photo forum&quot;), and thought I would post the pic and suggestion for the abundant left-overs (it was only hubby and I to start with, and this recipe makes a lot). Then I used it again the following night to make a teriyaki stir-fry. Thanks again for &quot;3&quot; meals from &quot;1&quot;."
945395,502034,2013/6/20,5,"Awesome! This was a family favorite back in the good ol&#039; days. My mother lost the recipe years ago, but looks like you found it. Thanks for posting this, ElizabethKnicely!"
768014,502034,2013/6/22,5,"This recipe is easy to make and is full of flavour. I added a can of kidney beans also, but that was the only change. This is a keeper and will become a family regular."
2697203,502034,2015/1/2,5,"Making this now, and I tried a little of the beef mixture. This is incredible!"
2002256532,502034,2018/8/24,5,When my kids were little I was the casserole queen! Bisquick's website has a TON of super recipies...YUM.
2000431901,516332,2016/10/31,3,Tasty and easy. I added a little fresh thyme as well.
369715,500386,2013/10/24,3,As written this was really salty for us. I added more chicken and mayo and then we all enjoyed it.
266635,494977,2013/7/22,5,"Another winner of a recipe!  Loved, loved, loved these potatoes -- just the right amount of spice -- not too hot, just earthy, fragrant spices that make these potatoes addictive.  I used the lemon zest and juice; however, I think next time, I would leave off the lemon juice as I prefer to be able to taste each individual spice in this wonderful spice mix.  Made for PRMR, July, 2013."
80353,494977,2013/8/22,5,"Made this and a similar recipe for dinner last night and we loved them both, so the consensus is - ras eh hanout and roast potatoes is da bomb!"
204024,494977,2013/8/26,5,Great collection of flavors combined with potatoes. I added some green peppers along with the red peppers. This made a great side to our spicey Vietnamese steak.   Made for ZWT9 for Hot Stuff.
542159,503089,2013/8/3,5,"This flavorful tea will chase away any sweet craving you might have.

A wonderful treat that will be enjoyed again, thanks for the post."
174096,503089,2013/8/10,5,"Very nice tea!  And yes, it is certainly sweet.  I opted to start with a smaller amount, as suggested, and thought it was quite good that way.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"

220348,505286,2013/8/13,5,"What a decadent way to end the day and the supper. I really enjoyed it. I also think you can&#039;t go wrong without this recipe, even if you didn&#039;t use the whip cream and chocolate shaving. I did have the whipped cream, though, and used it. I kept this alcohol free, by not using the Tia Marie, because I was tired by the end of the day, and felt it would just keep me up longer."
37449,496707,2013/3/29,5,"Yummy sandwich! I didn&#039;t need to bake it at the end, the cheese was nice and gooey with frying it a little longer. Thanks!"
461834,492961,2013/3/26,5,"Wonderful change to the everyday burger!!!  I made 1/4 of the amounts, for my lunch, which I just served with some chips.  To me, the soy sauce was more then enough for basting the burger and would cut that back next time, but definitely makes/flavors the burger.  I couldn&#039;t find a poppy seed hamburger roll, so just used my store&#039;s bakery, Chicago Hard Roll, that I toasted.  I liked it as written, but enjoyed it even more with some mustard and onions.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Spring 2013 PAC."
724631,518599,2014/10/3,5,"I made half a recipe, which made 8 2-Tbsp. servings.  It was very easy, and delicious!"
794029,518599,2017/8/4,5,"This is a terrific and incredibly easy recipe. Delicious on our Greek salad tonight (was planning to make Greek dressing, then realized we're out of lemons). All ingredients are pantry staples for us so will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!"
542615,507176,2013/10/21,5,This recipe is so moist &amp; delicious! Will definately make these again &amp; again! The icing is a great finishing touch for these!
1802501758,507176,2014/2/17,5,This really turned out good. Very moist and yummy! I had to add a little more milk to the icing to get it the consistency. Delicious. I will make these again
2879820,507176,2014/4/29,5,I&#039;ve made these twice and both times everyone has loved them!! This recipe is great. It makes a full sheet pan. Great for parties!! Wouldn&#039;t change a thing about recipe. I will be making these banana bread brownies again and again!!
2116904,507176,2015/1/13,5,"I saw this posted on FB this morning and I made the recipe this afternoon...it looked THAT good! Yes, it tastes as good as it looks, too. I&#039;m not the biggest fan of banana tastes but this banana bread brownie is truly amazing. It&#039;s moist, sweet, flavorful and memorable. Both my kids and my husband had 3 helpings tonight for dessert! I will definitely be making these again for dessert and for parties. Yum!!"
1803660036,507176,2015/1/14,0,"If you let your bananas ripen to where the peeling is black, it will be even more flavorful and moist!  I have not made this recipe yet, but once I do, I will let you know how it comes out. Can&#039;t wait to try it."
1803679276,507176,2015/1/19,5,Just made these tonight.  AMAZING.  But the only thing I was unclear on was the butter; it didn&#039;t specify whether the butter had to be salted or unsalted.  I used unsalted; still tasted really good.
1803682007,507176,2015/1/19,2,I also saw this on FB and made them last night.  Way too sweet for my family.  I&#039;m not really sure why they are called brownies because they are really just very moist banana bread squares.  Although they were yummy (with out the frosting) I will not make them again because my banana bread recipe is better.
5456441,507176,2015/1/30,5,"Thick, rich, moist, and the sour cream made it so yummy!  I&#039;ve never made a frosting like that, and I&#039;m definitely a fan. More cake/bread like than a traditional brownie texture. No walnuts, so I used pecans, excellent results that way as well.  Thanks for sharing, it was a good one!  Made a lot, so the remainder will be cut, wrapped in plastic wrap, bagged and frozen for a later treat."
2000137988,507176,2015/4/13,5,"This is my fourth time making these delicious brownies by request from friends &amp; family  members. Remember, the riper the banana the sweeter the brownie. Very moist and taste great with or without walnuts."
2000141599,507176,2015/4/14,5,"I too saw this on Facebook and I made them for a work function.  If you are a banana bread fanatic, you are going to love this.  I didn&#039;t have a &quot;jelly roll&quot; pan so I used a cookie pan of the same size that had 3/4inch sides.  This worked perfectly.  And because I knew my pan wasn&#039;t quite as deep as a jelly roll pan, I only used 3 bananas, but it was still fantastic.  
I made the icing while it was baking.. and only waited about 5 mins for the cake to cool.. because it said to ice it while warm... and you absolutely need to ice it while warm because the icing consistency is not like regular icing.  I will make this again and again"
2000247141,507176,2015/6/4,5,I just made this. Yummy!  I exchanged the vanilla in the frosting with bourbon and it is SO GOOD!  This recipe is a keeper!
126140,507176,2015/7/31,5,Love these bars.  Everyone thought they were delicious.  And the brown butter frosting is a perfect compliment.
2000426126,507176,2015/8/24,0,I have made these half a dozen times and only once did they turn out moist and dense like a brownie. All other times they turned out like banana bread. I&#039;m using the correct size pan and follow instructions to the &#039;T&#039;. What am I doing wrong?
2000833103,507176,2016/1/22,5,"This recipe is AWESOME! I made it with a few slight variations, and got some seriously delicious results. First, I made the &quot;brownies&quot; in a 9x13 cake pan, because I wanted them to be a bit thicker (if you do this, you MUST add on some extra bake time - I did about 10 minutes). I also halved the icing recipe (less surface area to cover...also I&#039;m not an icing girl, so a thinner coat is desirable to me). Finally, I chopped some extra walnuts and sprinkled them in the icing. I got rave reviews from everyone who tasted...even my tough to impress mother! Will definitely be making this again! YUM!!!"
2001091390,507176,2016/7/17,5,"These are INSANELY delicious! I found this recipe last year and have made them several times since, including just this afternoon- yum! I use chopped walnuts in the batter and toast another 1/2 cup to sprinkle on top. Go. Make them! :)"
2001179401,507176,2016/9/23,5,This is the best banana recipe I've ever found. Mine didn't turn out brownie like but the fluffest cake like and I added pumpkin spice instead of vanilla in the icing. It's amazing!!!
2001355566,507176,2017/1/17,5,Followed directions exactly with the exception of using a regular 9x13 cake pan and baked approximately 35 minutes. This was so good that everyone had it gone by day 3. It tastes even better the next day. Very yummy and a definite keeper.
10449415,507176,2017/5/19,5,"Delicious, easy, and not a lot of ingredients! I halted the recipe the first time since I only had two bananas and that made a nice 8x8 pan. Loved the moisture batter and easy icing."
2001986025,507176,2018/2/11,5,"best banana recipe..i always throw over ripe bananas in the freezer, and when i have 4 collected, i thaw them out and make this recipe.. changed it up a bit..although this recipe as is, is just perfect..i used self rising flour and skipped the salt and soda..(becuase i was out of all purpose..but still turned out perfect) and also used a 8x13 pan, and increased baking time...this time i added mini cho chips...the kiddos went crazy~!~!~! maybe someone else has noted this, i didn't read thru all the recipes but bon apetit"
227652,507176,2018/3/3,4,I made this for a neighbor and she really enjoyed it. I used about 4 small ripe bananas and baked for 30 minutes in a 13X9 pan. I threw it in the freezer for about an hour but it was still very moist so it really is more of a cake than a brownie. But still delicious. My neighbor said it was sweet enough w/o the frosting (I made a cream cheese frosting for her at the last minute)
2000847134,507176,2018/4/18,0,Shouldn’t they have chocolate if they are called BROWNIES?
2002165420,507176,2018/5/26,5,"so we changed a few things. First we substituted regular flour for Gluten free. we used glutino all purpose flour. I looked it up it read an even exchange which was easy. I didn't have all the powdered sugar I needed and I used some regular sugar. I lookedup the radio for that. it worked out fine. We're added on serving of apple sauce because gf flour tends to be very drying. I likemy calls, brownies really moist and not dry or cakey. I also use copper chef and because of the heat conduction cook times are quicker. so 20 minutes max or 15 for more gooey. We used Almond milk instead of regular milk. We opted to use the walnuts. good source of omegas!"
2001842075,534955,2018/2/2,2,The recipe didn’t indicate what size binder pan to use and also how much butter to use for fudge filling. I guessed and it was a flop. Can you tell me how much butter for fudge and is one cup flour enough for the cake? Also what size bunt cake pan. The cake didn’t rise like the video or picture indicates
2001914022,534955,2018/2/10,0,Does it really only take 20 minutes to bake??????
2001391724,494765,2017/2/14,5,I have been doing this recipe for quite awhile using a Kitchen-Aid mixer. I recommend dividing the dough in half and making two loaves as one is huge. I also recommend 425 deg for only 30 Minutes. 45 minutes tends to burn the sesame seeds and the crust turns out like wood.
2418836,494765,2017/4/16,5,"My son started making this bread 4 years ago when he was 16 and it is the best Italian bread recipe online. My family is Italian and they prefer this over the local bakery bread. The only adjustment we make is to add the sugar in with the yeast as it blooms, it really feeds the yeast and gives a stronger yeast flavor in the cooked bread."
2000401209,534955,2018/2/10,0,"Now I may have missed something, but if not... I've just read the banana chocolate Tunnel of Fudge cake recipe. It looks great!! The fudge filling directions tell you to 'add the butter' at the end. However, the fudge filling ingredient list has only chocolate and heavy cream - unless i'm wrong it appears the butter quantity is not listed here, only listed in the cake batter portion. It makes me suspect the whole recipe hasn't been tested. I won't make it. It's a very good idea to always have someone make your recipe, following the directions you intend to post on a recipe site, before you post it. It's so easy to omit some ingredient or a step, when you copy out a recipe. We've all done it. Proof baking is a good practice to use, but you must have someone else do it for it to work, because you already know what goes into the recipe and might not realize an item is not listed in the ingredients."
2001936405,534955,2018/2/10,0,Would not turn out very well if some ingredients are missed in the recipe like in this one
2937661,534955,2018/3/13,0,I didn't make it because the name makes me laugh too hard.
1755201,534955,2018/3/14,0,It says 1 Tablespoon of butter in the filling ingredients list!
2002080294,534955,2018/3/28,1,"I just tried to make this cake but my fudge that was suppose to be piped into the cake was too thin to pipe. Was it suppose to be chilled? And so when I baked it, the fudge ran all over and the cake was so gooey at 20 min. I baked it longer in hopes that the cake part would cook enough. It is now cooling for the 15 minutes. I hope the cake and fudge sets so that it is edible. I will update this post if it comes out okay. Otherwise, GK, please review this recipe."
480195,503588,2013/7/24,5,This was so easy to make in individual ramekins. It looked great and the flavor combination was a real winner. This is a 5 star dish! I served it with naan bread and a salad for a perfect meal.
107583,503588,2013/7/26,5,"I debated on making this because it meant a trip to the liquor store, but I thought waht the heck.  Even though we don&#039;t drink, both of these &quot;boozes&quot; were good to have on hand for cooking.  So glad I came to that decision.  This dish is excellent!  Great flavors and really very easy.  I halved it for the two of us and there is still enough for lunch.  Will be making this again.  Made for ZWT 9."
67728,503588,2016/8/23,5,"This was fabulous, Vic! I just happened to have bottles of both Ouzo and Metaxa on hand (y'know, from the last time we ended up in Greece? Lol), so I figured why not? Flaming the shrimp was a little scary because I'm usually too much of a chicken to actually flame anything in my own kitchen (I have a bad track record for accidentally starting alcohol fires at work), but it really did tame the liquor in this. I served this as part of a &quot;surf and turf&quot; dinner with some Delmonico steaks and Syracuse hot salt potatoes -- Greece by way of NYC? Thanks for posting this wonderful shrimpy dish! Made for CQ2016 Greece for Team Iota Eta Pi"
339260,513085,2014/4/17,3,"I made this recipe exactly as written.  It tasted good and was very filling.  I really liked the flavors of the jalapeno peppers, green onion and olives, but I prefer a creamier cheese over the nachos.  Sprinkling the monterey jack and cheddar cheese on top and putting it in the oven gave a firmer, grainy texture to the cheese instead of the smooth creamy cheese that I am used to.  Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2014."
1803376942,513085,2014/11/20,0,Yes I made this as well. and the nachos was very very delicious! but i struggled with the cheese as well. It wasn&#039;t grainy for me but it had more of a pizza cheese effect basically holding everything together. I would prefer a creamier cheese as well. how ever it all tasted wonderful! I would recommend making this as a movie night snack with your family or a lover. and sitting around the tv watching a nice horror movie!
67728,505968,2014/5/5,5,"Spinach is one of my favorite pizza toppings, so I was pretty sure that I would enjoy this. I used this as a base for Recipe#330653, and I spread a bit of homemade pesto on it before adding the toppings. I&#039;m not sure I would use this to replace the crust with every type of pizza, but I would definitely use it with any veggie or chicken pizza toppings. It&#039;s a pretty delicate crust, so my pizza was definitely not a &quot;pick up a slice and go&quot; affair -- this required utensils. I&#039;m not sure how it will hold up if reheated  because I haven&#039;t tried that yet, but I know that it makes for some fabulous cold leftover pizza. I love homemade pizza, so I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be using this often. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1311041,505968,2017/3/24,5,"Okay! It turned out!!! Tasty and tender but u can also hold it or roll it up! I didn't have stuff to put on it for pizza to bake on crust but I sprinkled mozerella cheese lightly on it right after it came out to cool before cutting. I dotted it with ranch and rolled it up or u can pick it up! Flavor is very light and not strong! Oregano and basil garlic powder pepper in crust mix! I wanted to test crust before I spent money on pizza toppings. It was good! My bf really liked it and he's picky! ??And for carbs watchers, this is a slice of heaven so I can't wait to add pizza toppings next time!????????"
461834,500040,2013/5/15,5,"Fantastic potatoes!!!  I made these to go along with a Chicken Souvlaki recipe I was making for dinner and the only changes I made was to scale it back to 1/4 of the recipe and used chicken broth.  I loved the parmesan cheese crust, so good!!!  This will definitely be a repeat potato recipe for me to make in the future.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for New Kids On The Block Tag Game."
486725,500040,2014/3/5,4,"Nice lemony flavor; this was definitely up our alley. I think we would have preferred roasting them (leaving the foil off, so they don&#039;t steam/get very soft). I tried to get a little browning and crisp them up by broiling them at the end, but it didn&#039;t really change that texture. It probably didn&#039;t help that I lowered the fat. I think these would surely be 5 stars if you make them without the foil."
305531,500040,2014/5/7,4,I made this for  2 servings. I used chicken broth and made as directed. I felt  that they had a great lemony flavor and we really enjoyed them.. Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
65502,502890,2013/7/19,5,I halved about 2.5 pounds of new potatoes for this recipe and they are delicious! I left the tin foil off for the last half hour and would probably not even bother to cover them at all next time. Loved the fresh lemon juice in this! Made for my fellow Tasty Tester. Thanks EK! :)
135470,502890,2013/7/24,4,"These had a nice flavor but I thought too much of the seasoning ended up gooed to the bottom of the pan and clumped together on the spatula when trying to turn them and they didn&#039;t get as crispy as I like. I would probably just skip the water next time. I added oregano,  and basil."

2001635564,496605,2017/7/20,5,"I grew up in the Triple Cities. There is a place where my mom and dad would take us for spiedies after choir practice at the Holy Spirit Byzantine Catholic church. In the snow or heat, we went to places, some in Vestal, Endwell, Endicott or Binghamton. Eventually mom would marinate the meat in Salamida's sauce. Even here in Tennessee I have been able to find the Salamida &quot;State Fair&quot; Spiedie sauce. The recipe here is a good one, though. Be sure to get good Italian bread to slice yourself for the spiedie."
2000046523,516448,2015/3/6,4,"This recipe is simple and i Actually did this much earlier in the year when raspberries when they went on sale here in michigan for .50 a pint. My dilemma is, they froze well, but now are extremely tart. I try to eat them in yogurt for breakfast, but sometimes i am making myself eat them so they don&#039;t go to waste. Any idea why this ahppened?"
2000677091,516448,2015/11/14,5,"The story you wrote about Fred Meyer (Kroger) raspberries is exactly what I did without kids :-)  Just got back from buying another 10 cartons.

In the summer I have my own small organic raspberry bush; however, when they are in season they rarely make them inside the house.  So for .99 cents a carton-I can do that.  Thanks for sharing."

Someone at our local Indian grocery store recommended MTR brand garam masala, and it was a good choice. I wasn't sure if I browned the onions enough (just didn't know what I was doing). I found that 2-1/2 cups of water worked better than 4-5 cups in my Crock Pot, and I used about 2 tsp. salt and Assam tea. I've made this three times already in the past month, so thanks again for sharing it! It tastes like it's from an Indian restaurant."

This is how I normally make potato skins, except your way bumps the flavor way up. I never thought of brushing the skins with garlic butter. Genius! I brushed the insides and outsides. Yummy! I served these with sour cream and chives. Definitely making them this way from now on. Thanks for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
482933,508538,2014/2/3,5,Superb! Love the garlic butter and of course the cheese and bacon. Served with leftover sauce from recipe#165433.  Perfect football food. Thank you for posting.
1925885,503792,2013/7/22,4,"This was an easy way to make spanakopita and makes a great appetizer.  Not really sure how to rate this because the taste was good, but the phyllo was a bit dry.  I don&#039;t know if it was the recipe or my phyllo - which I must admit was in the freezer for a few months.  I did brush the top of the rolls with butter before baking, and then again after they came out of the oven.  Total baking time for me was 25 minutes.  In any case, this is still a keeper and I will try again with a new box of phyllo, maybe being more generous with the butter!  I think these make a perfect starter for a dinner party, or if cut on the diagonal, perfect for an appetizer tray. ZWT9 for Gourmet Goddesses!"

865936,502942,2013/7/26,5,This is a very good spice rub and not too salty.  I used it to make Louisiana Red Beans and Rice.  I&#039;ll also use it plenty as a rub for meat and fish.  It is that good!
169430,502942,2017/3/3,5,Made this wee flavor wonder yesterday and added some to last evening beef and bean soup with great results. Super quick and easy and I'm currently thinking that I want to try it added to the next batch of biscuits to make them a lot more interesting (I also have some pickerel in the freezer that would really benefit from a nice covering in this. Keeper! :D
266635,502942,2017/3/4,5,"Lots of flavor and definitely spicy -- I can imagine so many uses for this spice mix. I'm planning to use this mix in some red beans and rice, but it would also be great on chicken breasts or ribs as a grill rub."
125356,508579,2013/11/1,5,"So simple and delicious. I used grilled boneless chicken thighs seasoned with  &quot;Zatarain&#039;s Creole Seasoning&quot; and..just because I had half and avocado I wanted to used up, I chopped it up on top before serving the pizza. I really liked the combo."
498271,508579,2013/11/4,5,"Great tasting pizza!  I made this on a thin crust using recipe #70165 and it was just great.  Here in southeast TX I can&#039;t get Provel cheese (seems to be a St Louis thing) but I did some research and found that it&#039;s a processed blend of cheddar, swiss and provolone.  Trying to get a similar taste/texture for my pizza I blended some Laughing Cow processed swiss cheese, shredded mild cheddar, and sliced provolone in my food processor and used that to top the pizza.  I can&#039;t say how that compares to real Provel but I can say it was delicious on the pizza and a great flavor combo with the BBQ sauce and chicken.  Loved this pizza - thanks for sharing your recipe!"
169430,508579,2013/11/24,0,"I&#039;d never had a chicken pizza before, this sounded interesting and it had two 5 star reviews so I had to try it. I made my own pizza dough with garlic and Italian seasoning in it and added some shaved onion between the bbq sauce and cooked chicken. It came out looking quite nice but sadly, through NO fault of this recipe, I discovered that I don&#039;t care for chicken pizza. I used 4 cheese Italian mix cheese. The sauce was tasty and the cheese yummy but for me the chicken got lost and didn&#039;t really add any flavor at all. Please don&#039;t let my review stop you from trying it if you already know that you enjoy chicken pizza. If you haven&#039;t try a slice or a bite and decide if chicken pizza is for you."
1803061442,518114,2014/8/23,5,Delicious!
2001732726,529875,2017/9/28,5,This was very delicious and super easy to make. Very much liked the idea of adding the spinach too. This will be an addition to our list of go to pressure cooker meals. Thanks for sharing.
2001905062,528768,2018/1/19,0,I make this and crush Doritos on top with a little sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese it is an awesome recipe. ??
2597942,515173,2014/5/6,4,"I left hubby in charge of making this dish for us (he&#039;s the hunter). We had this for dinner tonight. I believe he prepared it (this afternoon) as directed, but I&#039;m really not sure. I printed this recipe out for him and he claims he followed it exactly, so I have to believe him. It was pretty tasty (for being venison, which I&#039;m not a big fan of to start with). The gamey flavor was hidden nicely. We both decided on a 4 star rating. It really is a good (and different) way to use up our deep freezer full of Bambi. I have this saved for next seasons hunt. Thanks for posting. (Made for PAC 2014)"
126440,498384,2013/8/11,5,I only made the potatoes but they were great.  Will try the chicken sometime soon.  Served with burgers.  YUM.
1803558439,498384,2014/12/25,0,"Haven&#039;t yet tried this but, having worked at shakeys and being in charge of doing the chicken for a while, I know that the brine mix had a LOT of celery salt in it.  The recipe would do much better adding some.  We also would marinate the chicken at LEAST 24 hours before frying.  Not sure 2-4 hours is enough."
2000857279,498384,2016/2/6,5,"I have tried this recipe twice, once on chicken and my wife says this the best chicken she has ever eaten.  The second time on a deep fried turkey.  It was great!!!  The only modification that I did was to marinade the chicken and turkey over night.  The flavor was fabulous.  This is my favorite recipe for frying birds."
2001773424,498384,2017/11/12,5,"I made the chicken and the chips, oh my god its better than I imagined, It is what chicken used to taste like. Better than KFC and just as good as Shakey's used to be. The chips turned out really just as good, although i seem to remember a thicker batter on chips. Had the left over chicken next day and it was still awesome. I only let in soak in brine for about 4 hours, next time will leave it in over night. Well done on copy cat recipe. I did put in about 2 tsp of celery salt"
2002134452,498384,2018/4/29,0,"Awesome, made chicken and mojos, my family was very pleased!"
2002047678,498384,2018/5/20,0,"Still haven't tried the recipe, but recently bought an immersion heater, and I've been thinking of using sous vide at 155&deg;F for two hours (one hour for white meat) in the marinade then flash frying in peanut oil at 400&deg;F for a few minutes. I'll try to remember to report back. The benefit of sous vide is the chicken inside is cooked before it hits the oil. You're really just looking at crisping the skin and breading, which I believe can be done at higher temp for much shorter time."
2913921,499965,2013/7/23,4,"This granola was great! Unlike other granola recipes I found online, this was the only one where I had all the ingredients except for the almonds. I also liked how simple the instructions were so I gave this one a go. I made a mistake from the start, I skipped over the beginning of step 3 and mixed in the sugar, vanilla, and oil to early! I wasn&#039;t sure what to do next but I just decided to leave the sugar and oil already mixed in the oats and still make a pot with more. So by the time I completed Step 3 properly my oats were so sweet I could have ate it as it was! I was very worried about how all that oil would affect the granola but I just pushed away those fears and set my oven to two hours. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hours later...the granola smelled and tasted great! However, it was really soft so I had to put it in the oven for another hour and 30 minutes before it started getting crunchy. I put in yogurt and made a delicious parfait when it was finished, and my health nut sis finished the rest of it as a snack. I am going to make this recipe again, and I will make sure to add as much sugar and vanilla as last time (1 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons of vanilla)."
2000498330,514478,2016/6/30,2,"Bland, bland, bland. The ground beef needs at the very least salt and pepper. The herb topping did not give off much flavor. Only positive thing to say--the burgers were moist."
94226,497309,2013/11/11,5,"Pretty awesome. I used a fair bit more ginger, and I think it really helped. I couldn&#039;t really taste the beer at all (not sure if that&#039;s a good thing or not - I don&#039;t really like beer). But overall really good and will make it again."
340141,503921,2013/7/23,4,"I used a stainless steel pan, and didn&#039;t have any problem removing them from the pan or lighting the fire, altho I was shocked at how high the flame went--and I even blotted out all the olive oil before setting it.   I used ouzo for the right square and Metaxa brandy on the left to see which one we preferred.   I think the ouzo was actually the best.   One star taken off for no specs on how high the heat should be.   On the one hand, it removed easily from the pan, which mean my heat was high enough to get a good sear and ensure easy removal.   On the other hand, it wasn&#039;t as melted inside as much as I would have liked.   But anyway, what an experience.   My sister said she would have paid $1 to watch.   ZWT9"
284897,503921,2013/7/29,3,"I made this for ZWT9 Vegan challenge.I used a vegan cheese, &quot;sheesh&quot; to substitute the cheese in the recipe, which I bought from a specialty market/shop this morning.I also used the olive oil and used corn flour as a substitute for the regular flour, a vegan brandy and pita bread to serve.&lt;br/&gt;The sheesh browned up very nicely in the hot oil and the sheesh looked impressive.&lt;br/&gt;The brandy flame was wonderful and looked fantastic!&lt;br/&gt;DD enjoyed the vegan cheese, but I am afraid I was not overly impressed.&lt;br/&gt;But in saying that I am going to remake this recipe using the cheese stated."
287255,503921,2015/2/15,5,Perfect!  I used a well seasoned cast iron skillet and did this exactly as the recipe said.  I did pour out the excess oil before lighting and still had a nice sized flame.  Used brandy because that&#039;s what I had on hand.  Real easy to make
2000373223,503921,2015/7/30,5,this is the perfect recipe for the saganaki thank you so much it was the exact one I was looking for
2002182814,503921,2018/7/11,5,It was great! Did not marinate for 2 hours still very flavorful and gooey!
2002306083,503921,2018/10/19,4,"I had Saganaki for the first time in a wonderful, little restaurant in Athens while on our Mediterranean vacation last winter, so when I saw this recipe I just had to try it. The grocery store in my hometown didn't have kasseri cheese so I used Kraft cheese slices instead. It turned out incredible!!"
296809,527651,2016/8/2,5,"Made exactly as written for Culinary Quest #3 except for the addition of sprinkled Old Bay Seasoning &amp; dried dill atop the dressing when served. Unlike most Icelanders who eat everything plain, I'm from the US &amp; prefer dressing on my salads &amp; fish, etc. This was such a quick easy-fix &amp; tasted great when served w/Icelandic fish balls &amp; potatoes. Icelandic fish balls are the seafood equivalent of a meatball here in Iceland. They are actually pretty good eating, but this lively sauce improved them substantially &amp; used an ingredient combo that would otherwise not have occurred to me. I think this sauce would be excellent w/shrimp as well. Thx for sharing your recipe w/us for the Quest. :-)"
679953,501626,2013/7/7,5,"Rosie, you definitely have a winner here.  Made this as written, using 2 drops food coloring, and 2 percent milk.  Made this and had these with the neighbors for poker night.  The butterscotch flavor really comes out, but just right.  Loved it.  Made for PRMR Tag."
2399085,501626,2013/7/9,5,Better than expected!!! Very creative and really tasted good! t really tastes like caramel apples! Made for PRMR!
9233796,501626,2014/9/15,0,For children--I would exchange the liquor in this to caramel ice cream topping that comes in the squeeze bottle. I am going to try it !!!
266635,514824,2014/5/10,4,"We always love homemade mashed potatoes; although I don&#039;t make them as often as I would like.  I did add more half and half and milk, but otherwise stayed with the recipe.  Made for Spring PAC, May, 2014."
1800232671,507153,2013/11/11,5,"This recipe is absolutely awesome. It was a big hit with my family, definitely a keeper for my recipe box."
4637477,507153,2014/1/31,0,I don&#039;t normally like meatloaf but this recipe rocks...many compliments from the family.
2000147875,507153,2015/4/17,4,I made this tonight for the first time and it came out very good for being the first time I&#039;ve tried to make my own I think it cAme out better my mom&#039;s lol I will be making it again thank you for a new recipe
2001487386,507153,2017/4/13,5,"Turned out very well, thank you."

323186,504040,2014/2/4,5,"One of those wonderfully satisfying meals that has everything in it, takes very little effort to prepare, feels soo healthy and tastes so good!  I did use chicken breast fillets, cubed, and I added shrimp, because I really like it in jambalaya.  Otherwise, as recipe. Delicious, thank you, made for PRMR tag game"
1744931,522425,2016/8/25,5,This is my family's favorite holiday pie. It is a perfect combination of traditional sweet potato and pecan pies. The sweet potato keeps the pie for being overly sweet and you have that pecan pie crust and nuts.
383346,496337,2013/10/22,5,"I liked this recipe a lot.  We had it for dinner me and DH.  Since he doesn&#039;t like bbq sauce a lot, he liked it less than me.  But for me this was perfect.  I used your recipe for the sauce (recipe#484256 ).  Thanks threeovens :) Made for Photo tag game"
2399085,498558,2013/11/15,5,"Made for PRMR! I haven&#039;t had a real Cadbury egg since I was a kid but these were good. Authentic, IDK but they tasted really good and creamy! Thanks"
143318,498558,2014/3/29,4,"The pure dark chocolate makes these taste better than the real thing! Although you heat the chocolate to melt, it&#039;s easiest to coat the eggs after the chocolate cools - and when the egg part is very hard/cold/frozen. Coloring one-third of the mixture makes for too many yolks and not enough whites. Also the toothpick drying method is messy and didn&#039;t work for me. The eggs are too heavy and fell. I ordered some egg-shaped chocolate molds (only $2.00 each) and will try again with those. Very delicious and fun to make."
227978,503019,2013/7/30,5,"This was a great, CaliforniaJan.  I couldn&#039;t find annatto seeds so used the saffron option listed in the cook&#039;s notes, and I think it worked well.  It was delicious.  The cilantro added such nice touch, and I really liked the addition of the green bell pepper.  Yum.  Made for ZWT9 (Caribbean)."
204024,503019,2013/8/8,5,"Very tasty! I was a little confused at first about just how much olive oil to use: read it through before starting!  The combination of veggies in the pan filled our house with a rich aroma. Rice remained just a little crunchy, which would call for a bit more water and longer cooking time, but not offensive and the whole dish was great!  Made for ZWT9."
135470,503019,2013/8/10,5,"This was really delicious, I loved the addition of the cilantro. I did substitute chicken broth for the water for extra flavor and after saut&eacute;ing the rice and veggies finished it in my rice cooker. Made for ZWT 9 Caribbean Islands by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers."
852554,503019,2013/8/10,5,This rice was excellent!  I used brown basmati and so I added a little extra water.  I also threw in a boullion cube for a little extra flavour.  Made for ZWT 9
599450,503019,2013/9/2,5,"10 stars, easily! This is the best rice I&#039;ve had the privilege to make and serve! Making annatto oil is over the top; so easy and so delicious! Love it! Thanks, CaliforniaJan! Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
724631,503019,2014/3/6,5,"Very tasty rice, yellow rice is DH&#039;s favorite and this was my first time making annatto oil (after Penzeys delivered).  The rice seemed very mild for all the sofrito, but I&#039;ll update after we eat some leftovers.  Served with Recipe#111637 chicken thighs and steamed broccoli.  Made for Best of 2013 tag based on momaphet&#039;s recommendation."
452355,503019,2014/4/9,4,"This rice was easy to prepare and was a pretty color from the annatto.  I subbed a red bell pepper for the green pepper--otherwise I made no modifications.  This was good, but a little on the plain side for us.  DH found himself jazzing his up with a little hot sauce.  Thanks for posting."
226863,493137,2013/4/28,5,"Delicious side dish!  Really loved the mushroom mixture, and can see serving that over other things as well.  The endive turned out nice and mellow and tender.  I alternated between high broil and low broil.....wasn&#039;t sure what would work best.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag."
2865770,502275,2013/6/30,5,Turned out very well! Thanks for the recipe!
30534,496263,2013/4/10,5,Excellant ! I made the recipe as directed. We really enjoyed the flavors of this dish.
2001784008,521673,2017/11/8,4,Great savory soup for a Fall day! I live in a very small town and the specific chilies just weren't available here so I substituted in some SW chilies and roasted garlic seasoning.
2734669,498559,2013/6/7,3,"I had high hopes for this recipe. Unfortunatly, it came out nothing like a casserole and not at all like the picture. Ours came out looking like my wifes broccoli in cheese sauce. She makes the same sauce (without the sage) and serves it to pour over steamed broccoli. The sage over-powered the whole dish and I do not recommend using the 2 teaspoons of &#039;dried&#039; sage. Also, the eggs got clumpy adding them directly into the hot cream sauce, as directed (my wife always tells me you have to &#039;temper&#039; the eggs (whatever that means). I&#039;m not sure if I did something wrong, but only 2 minutes in the oven (per instructions) did not turn this dish into a casserole. I think we will stick with out regular cheese sauce, but this was a good attempt."
323186,498559,2013/11/12,4,"Well, we certainly did enjoy this,  although I also got a creamy rather than a firm sauce.  I liked the sage, and we found this a nice side-dish, served with chicken and little roast potatoes.  Not a wonderful photo, I&#039;m afraid, but it was enjoyed :)  for PRMR tag game."
136997,498559,2014/6/27,5,Very nice side dish. I made this ahead and baked it in a 350 oven for 25 minutes to reheat. I also added some leftover carrots. :)
58104,501182,2013/6/21,3,"I made 1/2 the amount. And it made two very large patties/cakes. I found the panko way to much. the sweet chili sauce I tripled in the sauce. Skipped salt because there was already soy. I did add fresh grown basil, mint and lemon verbena. Thai to me always has fresh fragrant herbs. I did serve over fresh picked greens and skipped the bun. I`m glad I did because of all the panko. Keeping it lower in carbs. I really wanted to enjoy this. My sister had to add more sweet chili sauce to hers. Thank you."
542159,501182,2013/6/22,4,"Good luck in the contest! I cut the recipe in half and served atop a fresh Thai slaw. I did top the burgers with the flavored mayonnaise which DH and I both agreed brought a nice flavor to the tuna. Other than using slaw in place of the bun did not change anything, DH loved as is but I was looking for a bit more punch. Thanks for the post."
226863,501182,2013/6/23,4,I really wanted to love this.....it sounded intriguing to me.  But there was just too much panko as posted.  I enjoyed the flavored mayo....and I think if you either increased the amount of tuna and threw in some cilantro or basil or reduced the amount of panko these might just turn out perfectly.  Thanks for sharing!
498271,501182,2013/8/28,5,"These are terrific tuna burgers!  I used regular breadcrumbs instead of panko, otherwise made as directed.  Cooked them undisturbed for about 5 minutes on each side and they got a nice crust on them.  I used spinach for the greens on the sandwich.  Easy to make and full of flavor - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
2001410044,498364,2017/2/28,0,Thank you for the shout out! The key to success with this recipe is to undercook it like it says. Other recipes cook it for way too long and it's dried out. I've since upped the liquid smoke to give it more flavor. Add fresh ground pepper to add to the complex flavors. New blog link at: https://gettinghealthyongoodfood.wordpress.com/
2001705806,498364,2017/9/8,5,This was so easy to make and tasty. I made the recipe exactly as stated but have to confess that I am not at all artistic so my streaks didn't look as good as the OPs!!??. For anyone who may be interested I cut it into strips when it came out of the oven (before frying) and froze them as there are only two of us in the house now! They fry well from frozen. Thanks for a lovely recipe.
2001057904,498364,2018/2/18,0,"I made this a few weeks ago &amp; it was really delicious &amp; easy to make. I am definitely going to make this again, but will add more liquid smoke. I also will layer it a bit thicker &amp; bake it for a few less minutes."
2002061584,498364,2018/3/18,5,Actually amazing. I don't normally sign up to random sites to comment but this was absolutely delicious. Agree with the previous comment about upping the liquid smoke slightly. I think I might actually add a little more salt or soy sauce too for that bacon saltyness. As it stands it's more like a sweet cure. Really good though and beats the expensive health food store stuff hands down.
542159,497618,2013/4/21,5,"So rich and delicately light! Made as a snack for DH to enjoy during the game and while I expected them to be rick with all the butter and cheese was very surprised by how light and tender they were. I made half recipe and was out of Tabasco so used Sriracha which gave a wonderful under that played very softly in the back ground. Must remember to make these during the holidays, thanks for the post."
2324285,497618,2013/5/19,5,"These taste like a cross between cheese straws and Red Lobster&#039;s cheddar biscuits.  I was expecting something like a cheesy rice crispy treat, but these turned out very rich and moist instead.  Mine didn&#039;t puff up in the oven because I don&#039;t think I creamed the butter correctly (I&#039;ve never done it before), but they were still enjoyed by everyone. [Made &amp; Reviewed for PRMR]"
2000151994,501182,2015/4/26,5,Delicious and easy to make.
2000045537,497917,2015/3/7,5,"The hunter here are still raving about how wonderful this recipe is! For such a simple recipe, it really delivers on flavor and couldn&#039;t be easier to make. Happy Cooking to you and y&#039;all!  Thank You!"
37449,501183,2013/6/21,4,I used whole wheat angel hair pasta and enjoyed the flavors. I used spinach instead of arugula. Thanks!
128473,501183,2013/6/21,4,"We enjoyed this lovely dish as a side with our oven baked chicken.  Made as written using arugula instead of spinach, loved the pepper flavor it brought to the dish. The angel hair pasta was light and refreshing, not too creamy, with great flavors, that all blended well together.  Great use of contest ingredients. Thanks for sharing.  Good luck in the contest."
2001933503,513062,2018/3/18,5,Turned out great for a first try! I will definitely be using this recipe again
39835,499899,2013/6/1,5,Very good chicken - didn&#039;t have any tomato paste so subbed catsup -- but other wise made as directed except I used 1 pkg chicken thighs and 1 pkg chicken breasts. This is the first time I made plantains which were interesting and along with fruit salad made a very nice dinner. Thanks for sharing!
163112,499899,2013/8/6,5,"YUMM!! I, of course, forgot to go out back for the thyme &amp; also forgot the tomato paste until I had dumped out the portion for marinating.  So, the sauce was a bit better than the marinade because I hooked that little mini prep back up, added the missing ingredients &amp; whizzed it all up!  My plantains were a bit on the soft side but still grilled well.  Absolutely delicious. Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
80353,503512,2013/7/31,5,"I actually froze the watermelon cubes and then zapped everything together in a blender so that it was kind of like an alcoholic watermelon slushie.  I understood the &#039;1/2 lime juice&#039; to mean the juice of half a lime, which was perfect.  I must have added a good 1 1/2 cups of frozen watermelon cubes and got enough beverage to make a long drink.  VERY alcoholic and really yummy.  Can&#039;t wait to have another soon."
865936,503512,2013/7/31,5,Sexy and delicious. I love the subtlety of the ingredients.

2001456646,519167,2017/3/26,5,"Great recipe. Used parchment paper - made hoisting it out of the pan simpler. Great recipe Marc. The nuts could be left out but I could not leave the dates out. I was looking for a recipe that included bananas, dates and nuts but did NOT have cinnamon, allspice, mace, or nutmeg. This is the one! very moist and sweet and banana-ee."
2001980633,519167,2018/2/8,0,"Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I made it last night and it's the best I've ever had and I've made plenty myself. Incredibly moist, especially considering the use of so little oil. Bravo Marc R.!"
2001981057,519167,2018/12/6,5,Made this recipe two days in a row because it was so good! I left out the water because my banana amount was closer to 2 cups and it was great
323186,505409,2013/12/3,5,"So -- I&#039;ve been stepping out of my comfort zone a bit, recently, trying to make more of the meals that DH really enjoys and I dont usually try -- this was a good example of an excellent meal that looked and smelled fantastic, tasted great, and put me firmly in my husbands good books, ha ha!   I used bacon,  I sliced the onions (just normal onions),  I used spinach along with a good helping of herbs from the garden,  I chose NOT to top with extra cheese because this is already a meal and a half!!   Loved the potatoes in this ...Annacia, this would have been perfect with a green salad and a loaf of crusty bread, neither of which I had, but for future makers of this recipe,  that will complete your feast!

1802633056,514941,2014/3/31,4,I tried this recipe and I found it easy to prepare.  I also found the recipe to be very good.  I will have to make this for a gathering I am hosting soon!
1741243,514941,2015/9/30,0,"I liked it, and it was easy although high in fat. I used regular potatoes and prepared them quickly, peeling onto news paper, and soaking in pan of water till ready. I tried Simply Potatoes a couple times when they were on sale. While pouring them out, I saw that the potatoes were spoiled in spots and cleaned poorly, to say the least. I had to cut and clean anyway. Even though I didn&#039;t  pay a lot, I did expect them to be easier to prepare than peeling. I have passed this on to the company, also."
842751,522377,2015/6/21,5,These were good. I used Kielbasa sliced like hot dogs and I also added come well drained sauerkraut under the mashed potatoes. I sprinkled grated cheese over the top before putting in oven. They were very good. It was a good way to get my son to eat mashed potatoes as he hates them. He at e the whole thing. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It is a fun way to get both the meat and potatoes together and I know now that I can get my son to eat mashed potatoes.
2001141168,504768,2016/8/25,5,"This dish is cooking in my oven now! I would not compare it to USA mashed potatoes, however I would compare to a sweet potatoe casarole served at Thanksgiving. It smells amazing and I can't wait to taste it to compare to American dish. Right now smells like it is going to be better! I was nervous because the turnip smells like what we know as a radish, which is an intense flavored root vegetable."
2001564498,504768,2018/12/15,3,Lanttulaatikko = rutabaga casserole. The recipe is correct apart from the turnips. Turnip is more bitter than rutabaga. I would recommend using rutabagas instead.

My wife loved it.  :-)  The tip for peeling the pearl onions was very helpful, as well.  I&#039;m filing this recipe for the future . . . I&#039;ll definitely make it again and again.  One thing I might add next time is celery.  I don&#039;t know if it will add anything but I see a lot of recipes that include celery so I want to see if it makes a difference. Thanks a lot for sharing this great recipe!!"
2002270980,536568,2018/9/9,5,I made this with no tweaks and it was amazing! The cake is moist and the topping crunchy - the perfect combination.
2002114649,536568,2018/11/23,5,One of the best recipes I've come across. I substituted sour cream for the yogurt (not a yogurt fan at all) and the results were very similar to a sour-cream coffee cake. Running it under the broiler is brilliant. Not only a keeper but a go-to breakfast/brunch favorite.
1576657,503396,2014/6/19,5,"This recipe is amazing overall. The crunchy rice crusts are one of the most transcendent things I have ever eaten. I subbed a few slices of crumbled bacon for spam (I made a half-recipe) and briefly roasted the shallots- it seems like the recipe implies they are supposed to be raw, but raw shallots are a little intense for me. I sprinkled in a little rice vinegar and sambal oelek before serving as well, and I think that added a nice tang in addition to the lime juice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this recipe!"
2001527511,533718,2017/10/7,4,"Great recipe, I also use mini muffin pan for holes."
2176807,518401,2015/11/1,5,"Needed to use up an overage of frozen green beans. This was so quick and easy, and really rich and creamy. Delicious! Left out the oil - cooked veg in a little broth. Did find I needed more broth than called for, just added extra broth, salt and herbs (used Mixed Herbs) on the back end - perfect. Will definitely make again."
1563111,518401,2017/6/26,0,Could it be made in a crockpot?
1803598119,520912,2015/2/6,5,This soup bring me back home. It reminds me of how my mom used to make it throughout my childhood! Very good!
1803650388,520912,2015/2/8,5,"This soup was so yummy, my husband and I loved it, the kids loved it!"
2001464620,502343,2017/3/31,5,Thanks from a fellow Athenian!
895132,505153,2014/4/15,5,"This recipe caught my eye because I&#039;ve been using cashew butter for gravy for years, but I&#039;ve never made it this way. It&#039;s absolutely awesome, we both raved about it. I used it on turkey cutlets, though, but I&#039;ll definitely make it with the above mentioned millet patties, too! Thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
340141,505256,2013/9/26,5,"I decided to serve this as a stew versus throwing it over rice.   It was excellent.   I particularly liked how easy it was to make.   However, I did use between 1 and 2 tablespoons of cajun seasoning.   I don&#039;t know if mine had lost its oomph, if Emerils is much more mild than Zatarain&#039;s, or if I just prefer spicier food.   However, with the seasoning increased, it was fantastic and didn&#039;t even need pepper sauce."
288146,505256,2018/4/19,5,"Loved this! I used frozen okra so only cooked for about 2 hours and it was awesome. I also used twice the okra and probably at least 2 tbs cajun season (homemade, the pre mixed stuff is always too salty). I served it over rice which was great but ate it as a stew leftover which was also delicious. Thanks for posting, I'm glad to have another great okra recipe!"
482933,499117,2013/11/19,5,"Creative, tasty, easy! Will definitely repeat. I made with green instead of red cabbage because that is what we prefer but can see that it would look even more attractive with other color. I knew this would be mild so it went perfectly with spicy sausage.  I think if you wanted a more spicy approach it would be easy. Maybe even add bacon pieces and omit butter? The 45 minutes in oven was spot on. I prepared earlier and refrigerated so supper was easy. Thank you for posting."
305531,500463,2013/8/19,5,"These were really good. I loved the spices with these lemony carrots. Thanks for sharing, Lynn. Made for ZWT9."
107583,500463,2013/8/24,4,"Easy recipe, but we found the lemon to be too strong.  Overpowered the spices.  Cooking time was perfect.  Will be making again but with half the lemon called for.  Made for ZWT 9."
163112,500463,2013/8/27,5,"Really tasty!  Really easy!  I love the lemons!  Everybody was happy with this dish - no leftovers.  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
1269180,510087,2013/12/16,3,"Bit too much heat for our liking - even with the chilli halved! Was hoping to get a totally new chilli con carne experience with the cocoa, but I felt like the chilli powder drowned it out."
1060667,510087,2018/10/16,4,"We liked this, but I think the cocoa powder leaves a bitter aftertaste? I even added some beef broth, just because we like our chili with some liquid, and I would have thought that would have toned it down. Regardless it was still delicious and we loved the heat :) :), if you don't like heat as much, tone it down some!!"
169430,505726,2013/8/16,5,"I really love carrot salads and the addition of oranges and dates really took it a couple of notches. This is both sweet and savory, firm and soft. I didn&#039;t use the full amount of the dates because of the sugar but there was enough there to add interest and taste. Thanks for posting Lynn, sooo good."
80353,505726,2013/8/21,4,"Very good - and the kids loved that the carrots hadn&#039;t been cooked.  I made a half recipe but kept the full amount of spices, and I thought that was just perfect, so I would suggest possibly upping the spices a bit if you make the full amount.  Did add a (small) handful of chopped pistachios over top for added crunch."
2701757,495701,2013/2/21,5,What a cool way to cook potatoes. They turned out terrific. I loaded them up with salt and pepper and a spoonful of sour cream. Yum!
204024,503795,2013/7/24,5,"This came together easily and both looks and tastes fabulous!  We used Recipe#502857 for the Creole Seasoning called for in the recipe. We kept it fairly mild, but depending on the cayenne in the seasoning mix, this could also be pretty spicy; the Andouille sausage has a nice heat to it anyway. Enjoyed making it and the family enjoyed eating it. Made for World Tour 9."
1531249,517119,2015/10/16,5,"This is a tasty and easy to make bread.  For the first rise, I let the dough sit in the fridge for close to eight hours.  I agree that this lends a nice flavor to the finished product.  I baked my bread in a 9 x 5 loaf pan because I wanted to use it for panini sandwiches.  The inside texture of the bread was slightly gummy (I cooked it long enough, validated by an internal temperature &gt; 190 degrees), but once toasted the texture was great.

Thank you for sharing this recipe."
386585,517873,2014/8/18,5,"I honestly wasn&#039;t expecting much, so I was surprised by how much flavor this rice had!  I made this exactly as posted, and the rice came out cooked perfectly!  It made a wonderful accompaniment to our Brazilian meal.  I will be making this again!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
1680722,517873,2014/8/19,5,A perfect and delicous side dish with a lot of flavor.&lt;br/&gt;I prepared this recipes as described and the dish came out delicious a perfect and perfect to Pollo Pendejo (Foolproof Chicken).

1058097,517873,2014/8/21,5,"Easy and delicious.  Mine took about a minute less than the recipe called for; my husband was sure it wouldn&#039;t be done, but it was perfect.  Thanks for posting!"
227978,517873,2014/8/22,5,"Yum!  It&#039;s hard to believe there is so much flavor in such a simple rice recipe.  But it&#039;s quite a delicious rice recipe, and I really enjoyed the nice boost of flavor contributed by the saut&eacute;ed onions and garlic.  It was a great side dish to our Brazilian Grilled Beef dinner.  Thanks, Lavender Lynn.  Made for 2014 Culinary Quest (South America)."
526666,517873,2014/8/23,5,"Just love how these simple improvements made such a tasty rice! Who knew? LOL Thanks for sharing, Lavender Lynn!"

1179225,517873,2015/10/4,5,This recipe turned out really nice. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
80353,503421,2013/8/23,5,"Delicious - and it hit all the flavour buds.  I have to admit to not going with the nest presentation as we were just too hungry, so I just piled the noodles on a platter, topped with the turkey mixture, drizzled with most of the sauce (keeping some at table to drizzle over individual servings) and topped with garnishes.  South East Asian is one of our favourites and this dish is fast, healthy and delicious."

2001579215,520223,2018/1/20,5,It was a hit...very easy to make once everything is measured out. Will definitely be making for every party I go to.
287084,508341,2016/11/20,4,I use this recipe when ever I have kale I want to make as a side dish. I really enjoy it!
401138,508341,2017/5/6,5,"Personally, I dispise kale and pinkel wurst, but my grandmother made it when we visited as children. They loved it while I .... um... &quot;avoided&quot; it. But the recipe is still the best one of its kind. Why people think recipes need to be so difficult to be good, I'll never figure out! Simple and delicious is always best."
2001102678,521648,2017/4/17,5,By the looks of the photograph it looks delicious
286566,498441,2013/6/20,5,"I used 500 grams of very lean mince/ground beef and used the panko crumbs and for dietary and likable reasons used spring onion for the onion and used micro grated cheddar for the parmesan cheese (that was the likable one) but otherwise made as per recipe.  I weighed my meatballs out and got 23 30 gram meatballs from the mix which took 35 minutes to bake at 175C fan forced, if I were going to put them into a sauce I would only cook them for 15 to 20 minutes (more than likely closer the 20 minute) as that would finish cooking them but in this case I poured the meat sauce over them but have to be honest would have preferred to have put them in the sauce as they were a little dry but still quite flavoursome (OMG just at this very point as I am reviewing I realized I did not put in the milk but in all honesty I think it may have made the mix to sloppy so maybe 1 egg and the milk!) but still a very delicious meal and very well received.  Oh I got 23 ball from the mix, thank you YnkyGrlDwndr, made for Aussie/Kiwi Recipe Swap #77 June 2013."
1932410,498441,2014/2/24,5,"I have used this recipe for many months now and we all like them so much. I don&#039;t mess with the recipe, and they are always delicious. Thanks for sharing it!"
1803748453,498441,2015/2/5,5,"This is a great, classic meatball recipe. Mine were anything but dry. A few suggestions would be to use a milk with some fat content, helps the meatballs stay juicy. Also, I&#039;ve found with meatballs that it&#039;s very hard to over spice them. I like to add heavy portions (close to a tablespoon) of dried basil and oregano. Also, a hint (about a half of a teaspoon) of cinnamon does wonders for bringing out the natural flavors in beef. 10/10 will use this recipe as the foundation for all my future meatballs!"
2000435669,498441,2015/8/28,5,"My very hard to please,  picky,  meat loving man has been raving about these for 3 days now.  The only difference I made was did 1/2 spicy Italian sausage 1/2 ground beef and put less basil bcs he&#039;s not a huge fan of basil.  This recipe is a keeper! !!"
2000790427,498441,2015/12/31,5,"I made these and they were delicious! I did make a bunch of tweaks to suit my dietary allergies: I used almond milk instead of regular milk, nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan cheese. I also used 1/2 ground chicken 1/2 ground lean beef, only 1/2 C breadcrumbs and parsley instead of basil. Delicious!"
2001371465,498441,2017/2/21,5,"The prep time is much more than 5 minutes. To keep the meatballs gluten-free, I toast 3 slices of GF bread, let them cook, and crumb them in my Nutribullet. I also mince the onion and measure out all of the other ingredients. I would say that prep time (if you are going to make your own crumbs) is close to 30 minutes. I used almond milk and brewers yeast per Jessica M's suggestions to deal with gluten and dairy allergies. I use half of the amount of brewers yeast so that it does not overpower the meatball; the brewers yeast gives the meatballs a fantastic &quot;nutty&quot; flavor. I put them in a crock pot with heated sauce after taking them out of the oven. I have tried other recipes and substituted 1/2 pork and the 100% beef wins out! We can't get enough of these moist, delicious meatballs."
2001513972,498441,2017/4/30,0,"I made these and tweaked the recipe to need/desire: Skipped onion because I don't care for onion Substituted 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder because that is what i had on hand Omitted pepper because I don't really like it all that much And I used basil from a container, not fresh. The meatballs are very bland. There is an overwhelming taste of milk. Not terrible. But not very good either. I was thinking about doing them again with less milk but then they wopuld just be dry and hard."
2001542975,498441,2018/10/16,5,I used this recipe to make a bacon cheeseburger meatball with ketchup and mustard for dips. Amazing!! I have had so many fantastic responses and requests to make it many more times!!
2001827999,498441,2018/10/21,0,What kind of beef - i.e. how much fat? I can't wait to try.
2549237,501762,2013/6/26,5,These were incredible easy and very fast.  I doubled the recipe to make enough wings for an entr&eacute;e.  I used Sweet Baby Ray&#039;s Barbecue Sauce and Frank&#039;s Red Hot Sweet Chili Sauce so that the wings were mild enough for my kids to eat.  They came out perfectly!  I will certainly be making these again and again.  Thanks for uploading this great recipe Whisked and Whipped.  Made New Kids On The Block tag game.
1052873,504832,2013/10/4,5,"This was really good although I usually think of coleslaw as the cooling part of a spicy meal. I like cooked coleslaw dressing much better than raw cabbage, so I changed it a little. I used 1/2 bag of prepared coleslaw mix - green and purple cabbage and carrots, 1 green onion, and made 1/4 of the dressing. I substituted salad oil for the dressing and mixed everything except the sour cream in a small saucepan and heated until boiling and the sugar was dissolved. I poured the hot dressing on the coleslaw mix and let it sit on the counter about 90 minutes. Then I stirred in a big spoonful of greek yogurt (sub for sour cream) and refrigerated. Made for My 3 Chefs 2013."
131126,504832,2013/10/25,5,"I opted to use only the green cabbage, but I loved this slaw. I served it with Recipe #505158 as part of the My Three Chefs event and am so glad I had seen this recipe. I will be making it again. I thought it would be good with a BBQ meal too."

653438,501924,2013/10/3,4,Made this for the tag game MY 3 Chefs Oct. 2013.  I did use thick bone-in pork chops and followed the rest of the ingredients and the recipe.  While the pork was perfect and with the seasoning I would definately add more to the rice mixture.  DH enjoyed this but said the rice needed something...some seasoning and  garlic maybe.  I will make this again and play with it but overall this was an easy and good recipe.  Thank you for posting.
77458,520447,2015/2/8,5,Very easy and very good! I will definitely make this again!
2675113,494505,2013/2/3,5,This looks delicious!!!  I love the bacon with the Ranch flavor.  Can't wait to try it.

4439,508709,2013/11/17,4,"This was delicious. I used low fat cottage cheese and low fat cream cheese. It was a little thinner in texture to use as a dip, so the next time I make it, I will use 4 ounces of the cream cheese and put the cottage cheese in a strainer to drain. DH made it last time and he didn&#039;t drain the cottage cheese. I also put in a small dash of liquid smoke."
4439,511645,2014/1/23,5,"I love Baccalla Salad but working the Salt Cod is such a pain. This salad is delicious, I made it with some frozen Cod filets I had and even DH liked it.

2597942,496287,2013/5/11,5,"March 20, 2013: Wow... what a great spice recipe for home-made chips. I can see how this can be altered to your personal preference. I actually added a tad too much of cayenne, but that&#039;s okay. Still it was fantastic. I used 2 different mandolins (one regular thin cut and one that makes rippled chips), and both turned out perfectly. I also used 2 different potatoes (one sweet potato and one russet). Also, both were just fine. Thanks for posting this recipe. (Made for &quot;New Kids on the Block&quot; tag game - Spring 2013). UPDATED May 11, 2013: I made these again last night to serve with some grilled rib eye steak sandwiches. This time I left out the brown sugar and added a touch more garlic powder, and they were just as good as the first time. This is such a versatile recipe, and I plan to use the instructions and seasonings many more times to come. Thanks again, Sharon."

There is none of the commonplace bitter broccoli taste, and it&#039;s so delicious, you can eat it  for an entire meal.   I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to service this over rice for a meatless meal.  I didn&#039;t even have the almonds or green onions; still fantastic.    It wasn&#039;t very hot at 1.5 tsp. sriracha."

135470,506822,2014/2/11,5,"Excellent broccoli! The combination of sweet, salty, and spicy really made this a veggie treat. I&#039;ve been in a vegetable rut and this dish helped to shake things up, and it was quick and easy to put it together which was an added bonus. My only changes were reducing the amount I made and subbing toasted pecans for the almonds because I had some on hand. I used the smaller amount of Sriracha which was plenty spicy for us. Made for Best of 2013 Tag, this is already headed for the Best of 2014!"
1436160,506822,2014/3/16,5,"This was delicious.  We loved the combination of flavors.  Because I only had about 4 cups of broccoli, I used a bit less than a teaspoon of sriracha sauce and did not take much heat, but this in no way detracted from the taste. Next time I will use a bit more sriracha. For the toasted almonds, used oven roasted almonds by Almond Accents.  Love those things! Thanks for sharing. Made for Best of 2013 tag."

58104,501154,2013/6/21,4,"Pizza was one that I made for the contest and didn&#039;t submit. VERY similar to this one.  I`m happy to see that you did! I did cheat and bought store made wheat dough. Directions were almost on key. I breast is 1 cup. I did cook up two as the recipe called for and didn&#039;t need the other. Black olives were just place on my slices. DH doesn&#039;t like them. I did use Tulsi basil, Italian basil and holy basil. OH  this would be 3 stars if we didn&#039;t use the OPTIONAL peanut sauce. SO peanut sauce is not an OPTION ITS A MUST for 5 stars. Thanks for a great creation."
58104,499379,2013/7/22,5,I&#039;ll be back to post stars after the 3 weeks. I did use whole yellow mustard seed. Three jalapenos. The red bell came to one cup. Garlic came to 2-3 cups. Making me wonder if the amount is wrong because the recipe states it makes 1 pint=2 cups. Mine made 1 quart and 1 pint worth. Sure looks pretty. Made for http://www.food.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?p=5895145#5895145 My Food Odyssey ~ May and June 2013&lt;br/&gt;Im back sorry Im  late. The garlic is very good.

251917,503630,2013/8/30,5,Aussie Swap #79: Made for Sunday Brunch!! WOW!! What a delicious recipe with an awesome kick to it!! Thank you!
133174,503630,2013/10/24,5,Very interesting recipe.  I have had sausage gravy for years but never with Italian sausage.  I had only sweet sausage so I added in some red pepper flakes.  Also my sausage was very lean and required the addition of olive oil.  We really enjoyed it with freshly baked biscuits.
157425,497924,2014/5/13,5,"Great banana bread and so fast to put together using my Kitchenaid mixer. I had large eggs on hand, love cinnamon so that was a nice addition, used 3 ripe bananas, and chopped pecans. My bread didnt bake evenly on top so I had to put  it back in the oven after an hour. Moist and delicious with a hint of cinnamon flavor in each bite. Will be making this again! Made and reviewed for Pick A Chef - Spring 2014."
1287956,521757,2015/4/26,5,"This looks like a lot of ingredients, but most were already in my pantry, with the exception of the peach jam and the meat.  For the meat, I just bought boneless pork chops, and then let everything marinade all day.  These were flavorful and very tender.  My husband even liked it so much, he had seconds.  Definitely a keeper.  We could even add some heat to this recipe with a ghost pepper or two, and still not lose the flavor of the marinade."
381180,502001,2013/7/14,5,Made with eight medium sized peaches ~ I substituted two tablespoons flour for the quick cooking tapioca.  My peaches were not very flavorful and I believe they would have tasted sweeter if I had reduced the lemon juice by half.  Tagged for PRMR July/August 2013 (with extension due July 20th).
328048,505582,2013/8/25,3,I used this with Recipe #417710. I found it a little bland. The spiciness didn&#039;t penetrate as much as I would expect and the other flavors blended together into something just sort of mediocre. I wonder if fresh spices would be better.
482376,505582,2013/8/26,5,I thought this was an excellent blend of spices! I made half of the recipe and have plenty to use in several recipes. Thank you for an easy and very tasty version of Ras El Hanout. Made for the Soup-S-Stars during ZWT9
204024,505582,2013/9/3,5,Great blend of spices.  This is wonderful for foods in Morocco/Tunisia.  Made for ZWT9 for Hot Stuff.
2324285,507583,2013/10/20,5,"Very good, although I cheated and stuck everything inside of toasted pita pockets.  I used grilled chicken, and made a greek yogurt sauce with fresh garlic, cilantro, parsley and mint.  Very much enjoyed by all."
486725,518998,2014/12/7,4,Very nice side dish. I used less oil and more basil. This would be great as a sauce if you stirred it up hot from the oven and then topped your pasta with it. It would be like a yummy goat cheese pomodoro.
280271,493387,2013/7/9,5,This stew is so very yummy and creamy...at first I didn&#039;t want to babysit my stew...but I grabbed a book and enjoyed my timer going off every 5 mins...I did that for the 1st half hour the last half I set the timer for every 10 mins...you really do need to make sure you scrape up all the good stuff on the bottom of the pot...btw...I used a wide bottom pot so the meat would brown nice and crispy...which it did...my meat did absorb all the oil so when I put in the rest of the flour and the onions...it turned to mush...it didn&#039;t want to brown...so I just went to step 6 and the next thing I knew I had this nice thick creamy tasty stuff...I cut my potatoes in chunks and they were perfect after cooking for 45 mins...I still scraped up the bits and pieces off the bottom of the pot...I had some mushrooms that needed to be used up so I threw them in for the last 10 mins...I decided against the corn...althou the corn would have given it a nice additional color...and probably flavor...I did add some extra salt and pepper...Oh! almost forgot...the meat turned out so tender...thanks for posting this...it&#039;s a keeper =)
2324285,493387,2014/2/17,5,"This stew is just delicious.  Very hearty and creamy, and full of flavor.  I mixed in some frozen peas at the end instead of corn, and instead of salt I seasoned it with Maggi seasoning, which gave it a nice umami flavor.  The meat came out super-tender as well, so this recipe is a real keeper."
1636975,499913,2013/10/22,5,"Used only 2 tbps of oil for the marinate, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. And, it was absolutely delicious! Had a veggie bacon, cheese, and tomato sandwich with mayo for dinner this evening and couldn&#039;t stop eating the leftover veggie bacon."
713037,499913,2016/12/26,5,"Amazing. I used a-little-warmer-than-room-temp-melted refined coconut oil as my neutral oil. I also did not freeze my tofu, rather I pressed the water-packed extra-firm block for about 45 minutes. I'm having a really hard time saving some for my fianc&eacute;."
2192609,497011,2013/3/11,5,"A hearty, bold, rich yet easy recipe...perfect for a cold night and a bunch of hungry kids!"

306726,497011,2013/3/12,5,Great new pizza combination!
2201427,497011,2013/3/22,5,What a wonderful recipe!!!  Italian comfort food ....... can&#039;t resist the great flavor combination here!!!
1547388,497011,2013/3/28,0,Wow this would be fantastic for dinner or breakfast! Beautiful photo!
482933,497657,2013/9/18,4,"Nice recipe with potential, but I had difficulty with crust, it was dry.  I could not roll it so used fingers to flatten. After making, looked at a similar recipe-old one of my mother&#039;s-- I would next time separate egg and put beaten yolk into dough, and if was still dry I would add milk.  Wish I could suggest amount but her recipe does not use sour cream. I would brush beaten white onto top crust. Used parchment for bottom crust eliminating one transfer, and for the top crust knew that I could not transfer it neatly so squeezed dough between fingers and then applied it in sections. Thank you sheepdoc for sharing."
2899267,498950,2013/7/14,0,EXCELLENT!  Loved these. Easy to make and enjoyable to eat!
323186,493181,2013/3/22,5,"I had strips of pork cut for stir-fry so used that rather than ground.   Little bit different, easy, very good with the corn and cheese :)   I used penne, would definitely make this again.  Thank you Boomette, enjoyed this, made for PRMR tag game"
2765275,498107,2013/5/13,4,"Such a great, easy recipe! And it was quite tasty. At first, it was a little runny because of all the liquid from the frozen veggies, but it thickened up when we let it set a little, and it was especially delicious when we reheated it. My husband thought it might a little too sweet from the honey, but I thought it was perfect."
233829,515433,2015/5/19,4,Nice combination of spices and chicken smelled good while cooking.  I made the chicken without the skin and it was still moist and had a nice flavor with a hint of heat from the chili powder.  Served with kale and brown rice for a nice and healthy dinner.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.
2399085,493181,2013/9/12,5,Made this for PRMR! great comfort food. I did change it a little. I added a little mozzarella cheese too. Great meal the whole family enjoyed! Thanks again!
194993,493651,2013/6/28,4,"I needed to make more than 2 tuna cakes, so I doubled everything and I was pretty generous with the mayo. As a result, I had trouble with the part where you press the cakes into the extra pork rinds. Solution: add the extra pork rinds to the mixture. I did have a bit of trouble with them holding together, but I found that the batter that sat while the first batch was cooking held together better. This made a lot of tuna cakes, and I could easily have gotten away with 3 cans of tuna and then improvised about the egg. I found these were very tasty and helped fill the void left by my favorite tuna cakes recipe #47504. I will make these again. Thank you Artboy34."
169430,505562,2013/8/19,5,"loof, I must say that I love your balls my friend :D. There is some very good flavor happening and this would be a really good spaghetti topping. Since we&#039;re in ZWT9 cooking for Morocco I served them with Recipe#504548  and carrot salad. Thanks for sharing this one."
2729300,497239,2013/3/12,5,What a great--and delicious--idea!  The separate sauerkraut and potato layers allow you to have two different kinds of pierogies on your plate in one serving.  So much easier and quicker than making individual pierogies--but every bit as delicious!
2549237,503614,2013/7/27,5,"This recipe is super easy and really good.  I have tried many recipes for Chicken and Grapes, and this one is my favorite so far.  The spices compares to the sweetness of the grapes is just right.  I will definitely be making this again and will post a picture then.  Made for team Tasty Testers during ZWT9 for the Greek round."
239758,512898,2014/5/8,5,"What a great salad. I made a third of a batch using two eggs, 3 small bacon rashers, cherry tomatoes and a slice of stale sourdough bread that I toasted. Also added some sliced cucumber, a few kalamata olives and a bit of feta. Yummo! My only change would be to use dijon rather than grainy mustard. I prefer the tang, but this is great the way it is. Thanks so much for posting."
226867,512898,2017/5/15,5,"Lovely lunch! I used real bacon crumbles to save some time and added some radishes to mine and sliced peppers to DH's. Instead of croutons, served with garlic toast. I also totally cheated and used ready made ranch dressing. (Gasp!) The spirit of the original recipe remained the same, though! made for Went to Market"
2000993011,525547,2016/4/30,5,"Very authentic tasting. I used ground turkey though because it was on hand. I substituted a chicken Boulion cube, went well with the turkey. I didn't have sour cream but the gravy was still good."
169430,504548,2013/8/19,5,"OK, honestly, I wasn&#039;t too sure what to expect from this but a like everything that was going into it so away I went. I&#039;m so glad that I tried this recipe, it&#039;s yummy enough to eat in a bowl all by it&#039;s self. Tonight I paired it with Recipe #505562 and carrot salad for a very tasty meal. :D"
47892,504548,2013/8/22,5,I used the same amount of potatoes (1#) but cut the eggs in half. What made this truly&lt;br/&gt;delicious were the freshly harvested potatoes from our CSA box. Perfect for our North African dinner feast last week! Made for ZWT9.
804550,504548,2013/12/17,4,"Great potato recipe! This ended up being a two night ordeal as I cooked new potatoes with their skins on and mashed them. This came about as I really didn&#039;t plan this well lol. So the next night I used the precooked mashed potatoes and then made as directed. I enjoyed it a lot and would have given it 5 stars however DH gave it 3 stars. So the compromise of 4 stars was selected. I plan on trying it again using whipped potatoes made with milk and butter, and more parsley and onions. I think it would also be very good with some extra sharp cheddar cheese on top too. Made for Fall NA*ME tag."
1680722,504548,2014/1/9,5,"I&#039;m glad I tried this recipe as it is extremely yummy!&lt;br/&gt;I did not have mashed potatoes leftovers and for this reason I prepared this fresh: breaking the boiled potatoes with the fork. I did not make it completely mush.&lt;br/&gt;After baking this in the mold, I inverted this on a plate to serve. We loved it!"
2001195693,535584,2018/5/3,0,"It didn't turn out because I haven't made it yet. The problem I have is that all over the news media and the internet we are being warned NOT to purchase or use 'romaine' lettuce! It has been deemed, [quote]:&quot;E. Coli Outbreak Tied to Romaine Lettuce Expands to 16 States&quot;. Therefore, I recommend caution when following some of these 'outdated' recipes for your own safety."
29196,497191,2013/3/25,5,I made these using tortillas rather than the crispy taco shells we get here. I used all the optional ingredients in the dressing and regular tomatoes. The dressing is amazing and the star of the dish. Thanks for posting.
780172,497191,2013/4/27,4,"These were good tacos. We enjoyed the sauce, it was a nice addition. I used hard shells and ground turkey. Will add it to my list of weekday meals."
1680722,501580,2013/12/13,5,"We loved this chicken recipe an it&#039;s taste.&lt;br/&gt;As we don&#039;t have tacos here I prepared some fresh corn tortillas that we used as soft tacos! Mhhh! To the chicken and tortillas we added fresh prepared salsa with fresh diced tomatoes, onion chlantro and chili. We also had some Greek yogurt to serve with it.&lt;br/&gt;No leftovers! I don&#039;t wonder! Thanks a lot for this post!"
2597942,502219,2013/8/26,5,I&#039;ve made these a few times... but I only make about 4 at a time! (Just me and hubby.LOL). Love all the ideas for the toppings. The only change I made was that I have those &quot;As Seen On TV&quot; taco bowls that you bake the tortillas in the forms (easier and less messy). I plan to make these when football season finally gets here and it is my turn to host (we usually have about 50+/- people). Great job on the large quantity instructions. Thank you. For posting. (Made for New Kids tag)
1567897,502688,2015/1/12,5,"Excellent recipe!  I followed it to the letter with the exception of using two 2 1/4 lb. boneless roasts.  The cooking time was the same.  I drained some of the liquid out after pulling out the roasts to shred, and fished out most of the onions.  I served the pork on onion rolls with extra barbecue sauce on the side."
1802623301,514920,2014/3/27,5,I&#039;ve been treated to this delicious dish! A great combination that can&#039;t be beat.
1802624654,514920,2014/3/28,5,Everything that this chef puts together turns to gold!
266635,513680,2014/9/18,5,"Fantastic steak and chimichurri sauce.  Loved that the chimichurri is made with cilantro vs. parsley - it was nice and tart and delicious.  Served this steak with some roasted new potatoes and a salad with baby greens and feta cheese.  One of the best meals I have had in a long time. Made for Quest, South America, 2014."
1925885,513680,2018/7/24,5,"Can I give this ten stars? After the first bite, DH said &quot;There's a flavor explosion in my mouth...&quot;. And after a few more bites, said &quot;It's a flavor explosion!&quot;. I guess he liked it. We both agree it's the best chimichurri we've had! I was a bit skeptical due to the amount of balsamic and because its a hot chimichurri. But the method really works and I wouldn't change a thing. We used a high quality ribeye for this, thinly sliced. Simply fantastic. Thanks for posting a keeper of a recipe! Made for SWT 2018, Team Incredibles."
226863,513680,2018/7/28,5,"I made this last night and went to bed happy! This is delicious! I grilled my steaks instead of cooking inside. I had a skeptic at the table about the chimichurri sauce, and he asked me to just fix some garlic butter for him. After seeing my reaction he changed his mind and helped himself to &quot;my&quot; chimichurri. Delicious! Made for Susie's World Tour 2018. Thanks for sharing a recipe I will definitely repeat often."
92006,513680,2018/8/2,5,This made a really tasty steak. I added some lemon juice to the chimichurri to add some freshness and we really liked it like that. Thank you! Made for Susie’s Tour 2018
37449,501181,2013/6/21,4,Very nice! The sauce really makes the burgers shine. I scaled down the recipe for one and didn&#039;t use any egg. Thanks!
200862,501181,2013/6/21,4,"(Made for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Pantry&quot;, June 2013). For the imaginative flavours you used, and the really great mayo sauce, definitely 5 stars!  (I used chopped fennel fronds because no dill, dried or fresh, was available). The lost star is because I really battled to keep the patties from falling apart completely! Chef, I loved the finely chopped veggies and olives you added to the tuna mix. I also loved that the mixture was not bulked up with heaps of breadcrumbs. But -- it would have been better if baked as a casserole! The finely chopped vegs and the undrained can of tuna meant the mixture was very loose. I even added more breadcrumbs, but it did not help. As can be seen in the photos, the only way I could get the patties to barely hold together was if I charred them on the underside, verrrry carefully turned them, and again almost charred them! Even so, of the 7 generous patties I got, 2 fell apart completely, and others cracked. One caveat: you don&#039;t mention the olives in your directions (a small matter which you can edit). I&#039;ll make this recipe again, adding even more chopped veggies, but I&#039;ll bake it in a casserole dish! :-) Thanks, and best of luck!"
220348,501181,2013/6/21,4,"I wish I could give this half a star. The sauce was awesome, but I had trouble making the patties, because I found the two different kinds of tuna made it a little hard to form the patties. But overall it was a great recipe."
131126,501181,2013/6/22,4,"The tarter like sauce is terrific. I loved the addition of dill &amp; lime.  The flavors of the tuna patties are really nice too, but they didn&#039;t hold together at all for me.  I ended up scooping the broken patties onto a plate and topping with the sauce. It wasn&#039;t pretty, but it tasted good! Good luck in the contest!"
695933,501181,2013/12/23,1,"I did not like the mushrooms in the patty at all, The sauce was O.K."
461834,499870,2013/6/6,5,"I tagged these due to DH likes brussels sprouts!!!  My Mother never made them and I have never tried them, but was willing to try them, but still had a back up salad set for me if needed, lol!!  I was totally surprised that I liked them and it was so easy to make for the most part(other then shredding the sprouts and juicing the limes.)  I still don&#039;t think they smell that great while they are cooking, same with cabbage, but taste is very good.  I would definitely make these again and could see adding onion and using lemon in place of the lime if that is what I had on hand, so good!!  Thanks for sharing a recipe that has now added a new  veggie to our dinners!!  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
2324285,499870,2013/8/19,5,"I love brussels sprouts, and this is really such a great way to eat them.  I can totally imagine brussels sprouts haters enjoying this, as the lime juice and stir-frying really mellows out their flavor.  Just an all-around great side dish for any occasion. [Made &amp; Reviewed for Rookie Recipes]"
844554,499870,2013/9/27,5,Delicious! I normally roast the brussel sprouts but this sounded good and it was. I added some onion to ours and cut the recipe down for 2 of us. Thanks! Made for Rookie Tag Game 2013.
37449,499870,2013/9/30,5,"I fixed this for my son and I. He normally doesn&#039;t like Brussels sprouts but he really enjoyed this, served with Asian salmon and a rice and barley mix. Thanks!"
226863,499870,2013/11/23,5,"Delicious!  Love the lime with the brussels sprouts.  I love brussels sprouts in any form, but these were exceptionally good, and so  quick and easy.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Rookie tag game."
169430,509192,2013/12/14,0,"I&#039;m not going to add stars because my version ended up being quite different from whats written. I have a habit of tagging only from the ingredient list and I did so with this recipe thinking that the flour would be for thickening the gravy. When I read that you are ask to flour and brown the cube steaks before putting them in the crock for several hr&#039;s I was surprised. In the 4 mins it would take to brown them the little steaks would be completely cooked to well  done. I just couldn&#039;t see the point in frying them and then crock cooking them for up to 7 hrs. In my humble opinion the crust would get very soggy at best or simply cook away into the sauce and you would end up with very over cooked and dry meat. I put the steaks into the crock pot raw and proceeded with the rest of the ingredients. I added more carrots, garlic powder and a very light touch of cayenne. Cooked on low for 4 hrs the meat was really trying to fall apart when I took them out of the pot. I then used the flour mixed with some water to add to and thicken the sauce. It all came out delicious and was a real hit with my very hard to please DH. I&#039;ll be doing this again as I have several pkg&#039;s of cube steak&#039;s in the freezer. Thanks for sharing your recipe my friend, your really on to something good here. :D"
39835,509192,2014/1/27,5,This was a wonderful dinner served with corn. Made as directed with the only change being using beef broth instead of the chicken broth. Thanks for posting this keeper!
2324285,509192,2014/5/29,5,"Thanks for sharing another great slow cooker recipe, duonyte.  I&#039;ve never eaten or prepared cube steaks, but this slow cooking method is great.  The meat came out super-tender, and the resulting gravy was tasty as well.  I also included some fresh garlic, Maggi seasoning and cayenne pepper for added flavor.  I served everything over roasted buckwheat, and I must say the gravy was perfect on it."
47892,499870,2014/2/6,5,This worked beautifully with organic brussels sprouts I picked up last week at the farmers&#039; market. I chose the olive oil option and pan fried them on *medium* heat. A few strands of lime zest was garnished on top. Really good and super easy. Nice change from the usual sprouts and lemon combo. Thanks for posting! Made for Best of 2013.
486725,499870,2014/2/24,5,"Cooked these over high heat (with less oil) to get them brown and caramelized, which makes them so good. We liked the lime with them, but I think lemon would be even better. The method is the star here."
1060667,499870,2017/4/14,5,"I liked this a lot! I have made brussels sprouts very similar to this before. I did char some of my sprouts and it made it a little bitter, but hey, my fault. Love the flavor from the lime!"
65502,532422,2017/7/27,5,"YUM! I love spaetzle and I'm always happy to break out my spaetzle maker. This was great! I prepared it as listed and it made a huge amount, which was fine by us. I did put the dish back in the oven for a bit to melt the cheese but that didn't take long. Made for CQ17 for the Smokin' Chefs. Thanks! :)"
498271,504658,2013/8/28,4,"Great salad - like a combination coleslaw and waldorf salad!  I used packaged coleslaw mix which had some carrots in it too and that worked fine.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
542159,504658,2013/11/2,4,A new savory twist on the Waldorf salad. Cut the recipe in half and used purple grapes and walnuts. The amount of dressing was spot on and enjoyed that it made a nice healthy side. Thanks for the post.
39835,493416,2013/7/6,5,Great summer salad! I tagged this recipe to use some pomegranate molasses that I had and I am glad I did. Did not have any pomegranate seeds but added some raspberries instead. Very good and interesting salad! Thanks for sharing!
873008,493883,2013/8/1,5,"I made it scrambled, but tasty nonetheless!"
480195,504575,2013/9/6,5,Very tasty drink! I used pineapple rum. We will make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
2000400279,516070,2015/8/13,5,Just made this and it was delicious!   I looked at a lot of recipes and choose this one because it looked easy and didn&#039;t have a lot of unnecessary ingredients or require a dutch oven.   I&#039;m so glad I tried it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!
400708,535644,2018/5/5,4,"Have to say this recipe contains some of my favorite things, cheesecake and blueberries, so it was bound to be a hit and was not disappointed. Only think I'd do next time is increase the amount of cheesecake, it wasn't as think as I'd like to have it; but the flavor, texture and appearance was all there. So good"
2001569345,516070,2017/6/4,5,I just made this and it is very good. I went ahead and scraped it first with the fork and then went back with a dull knife and scraped the rest so I would get everything. I didn't realize making creamed corn that you had to put a lot of muscle into it!
2001209197,516070,2017/9/2,0,Can I freeze this after?
2001855333,516070,2018/7/4,5,My dear departed Mom in law taught me how to make creamed corn. Basically it was skillet corn which was delicious in its own right. This recipe is totally CREAMED corn. One barbeque chain sells &quot;creamed corn&quot; which is basically whole corn with milk/cornstarch base. True creamed corn you have to cut off the cob just as directed and scrape the corn milk out of the rest of the cob. Today I added butter and heavy cream in place of the milk and let it simmer down. AWESOME!
2001047423,530729,2017/4/18,0,"This was a totally new food for me as we don't have 'tots' in Britain. I got the impression they are usually deep-fried, maybe usually made of potato, but these were great &amp; I shall make regularly &amp; research tots &amp; experiments when I have time. Never seen Buffalo sauce but I have Tabasco &amp; Franks so used Tabasco. I don't need gluten-free so next time I'll use breadcrumbs as rice-cereal has sugar in it &amp; I don't often buy it. I liked the idea of almond flour, I'm not sure if 'ground almonds' sold in the baking aisle (to be added to cake with standard flour to make the cake taste of almonds &amp; add texture) is the same thing as 'flour' as I think 'flour' is finer, but it worked! Served with devilled chipotle eggs from here, celery as in the picture, various salad stuff &amp; jacket spuds &amp; cheeses, as well as the recommended dressings, Ranch &amp; Blue Cheese. Yum Factor 100%!"
482376,499351,2014/9/2,5,"Tasty soup! It was pretty involved, but I knew that getting into it. I made a half batch, since it will just be me eating this. The broth was nice - full of mushrooms and bok choy, but I loved the potstickers the best. Yummy!!! In fact, I may just make the potsickers and fry them up without the whole soup next time.  I toyed with giving this recipe 4 or 5 stars, but those potstickers tipped it to 5. Thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest - China - International Agents of Quest team."
2000507556,530729,2017/4/24,0,"Hi Jonathon, when do you use the Crispy Rice cereal as I can't find where it is added in the recipe. I am very interested in trying this as I am following a low carb program and it would be good to have a use for all the cauliflower stalks that are left over. Can you use broccoli stalks too, or maybe a combo of cauliflower and broccoli?? Thank you for this recipe, Kind Regards, Cilla :-)"
2000782400,530729,2018/4/22,3,"I am surpised that Jonathon has not responded to the alert that there is no reference as to what to do with the crisp rice cereal called for in the recipe. Itis obviously missing, and should be addressed.Why then is the recipe being used again without being corrected?"
2001366032,513062,2017/6/20,0,"Always looking for new ways to make breakfast less boring. Tried it , love it. Thanks for sharing."
2324474,513062,2017/6/20,5,"I have been making these lovely cloud eggs for the guests at my bed and breakfast for almost a year. Very easy to make, delicious to eat, and a beautiful presentation."
2001280416,513062,2017/6/20,1,"I'm sorry but these are the ugliest eggs I have ever seen; no way I would ever eat this or serve it to my family. And I'm a foodie, I love to try different things but this is a no-no."
2001593306,513062,2017/6/21,5,Very appetizing. All my guests were pleased. They asked for them the next morning!
2001602533,513062,2017/6/27,0,"This is a vey nice recipe. Didn't have chives on hand, so subsistuted with finely chopped green onions. Came out great and looked exactly like the photos posted with the recipe. Will certainly make again and thank you for posting it."
2001537667,513062,2017/7/7,0,This is a much shorter cooking time than I'd have expected for the whites. They're set all through so quickly?
266635,509357,2013/11/26,4,"This makes a really nice chicken and rice dish.  I always enjoy boneless chicken thighs because they are so flavorful.  I did serve this dish along with soy sauce, but the grandkids preferred it just the way it was.   Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
50509,509357,2014/2/13,3,"We are somewhere between a 3 and a 4 on this. Mr Grumpy was not a fan. I loved the simplicity - easy to do on a weeknight if your chicken is fresh or thawed. I used thighs and drumsticks. I think I would stir in some mixed vegetables with the rice, just to add a little color and nutrition into the final dish . I used regular rice (I don&#039;t like the instant) and it cooked in about the same amount of time. Thanks for something that is a reliable and easy recipe that I can build upon."
266635,510791,2014/1/20,5,"If you love cabbage, you&#039;ll love this soup.  Loved the sweet and sour flavor and the addition of the golden raisins.  If you want a more substantial meal, you could add some steamed brown rice to your bowl and ladle the soup over it -- don&#039;t forget the dollop of sour cream on top. : ).  Either way, this soup is really delicious.  Made for PRMR, January, 2014."
2002179232,513062,2018/6/9,5,I had forgotten about these! Mom used to make them for a late breakfast for me sometime. Good memories.
2002189122,513062,2018/6/17,5,"I kinda messed up the recipe, yet still, they were wonderful. A great treat with your breakfast/ brunch."
122235,513062,2018/7/11,5,"I served these eggs with blueberry muffins &amp; sliced nectarines for a simple brunch. They were delicious! The presentation is quite elegant, making this a good choice for entertaining. It is easier to make than you would think, especially if you have a stand mixer. Most of the work can be done in advance with just the quick baking at the last minute. I couldn't find chives, so left that out. Otherwise, I prepared as directed. I will definitely be making these again (and again)."
2001055680,513062,2018/7/21,1,Neither my husband or I cared for these at all. Nothing special.
865936,515103,2014/4/28,5,This is delicious! Everything in it is perfectly healthy and refreshing. Next time add a little more milk though.
280271,499506,2013/9/15,5,We loved this...the flavors were very Asian...not sure when I was to add the red pepper flakes so just added them in with the ginger...I omitted the peanuts and used butter lettuce for our cups...I made this for our lunch so 4 servings turned into 2...the prep and cooking time was a bit off...total time was about 30 minutes for me...this is a keeper...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
37449,501180,2013/6/21,5,I was surprised how much I enjoyed this slaw.  A nice change from my usual dressings. Thanks!
1925885,501180,2013/6/21,4,"I really wanted to love this coleslaw, as who can resist peanut sauce?  And I was intrigued by the use of dill pickles.  The salad was lovely - I used a mix of red and green cabbage.  The dressing was pretty good, too, but the dill pickles were a bit too pronounced for me, in spite using less than the recipe called for.  I thought they distracted from the Thai flavor, and were a bit too sour for the rest of the ingredients.  I will definitely make this again, but will leave out the dill pickles and the peas.  Thanks for your creativity and the base for a really good Thai coleslaw!"
128473,501180,2013/6/21,5,"My dh &amp; I really enjoyed this tasty coleslaw, especially all the vegetables and cilantro/mint combo.  We love thai food and thought that this was awesome.  I made 1/2  batch exactly as written and 1/2 batch without the peanut butter for my dh (allergies). Both versions were terrific. I opted to use fish sauce instead of the soya sauce and was really happy that I did. The slaws were garnished  differently one with sesame and cucumber and the other with cilantro and peanuts.  Nice use of contest ingredients.  Good Luck in the contest."
160977,501180,2013/6/22,5,"It&#039;s asparagus time here and I am glad that this recipe was created. It&#039;s nice and fresh. used soy sauce and fresh basil. Found that one teaspoon sesame oil was enough, otherwise the taste would have been too strong. I halved the recipe, otherwise it would have been too much for us. The leftovers were nice but I would not recommend to save it for more than two days, the asparagus gets too wilted. Thanks for creating and posting. Made for Raiders of the Lost Pantry Contest."
2324285,511398,2014/1/14,4,"This dish was very easy to throw together and the portion sizes were spot-on.  It was a bit bland for me, but that&#039;s easily tweakable.  I loved how moist the chicken was, without it completely disintegrating in the sauce like with so many slow cooker recipes."
498271,503218,2013/7/16,5,"Terrific!  My chili powder was hot so this had a nice kick to it.  I used a medium-sized potato (peeled and shredded) instead of the frozen hash browns.  Served this as a main course for a hearty and delicious vegetarian meal - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
1052873,505826,2013/8/19,5,"Tasty, but not what I expected. Soup-like. Made for ZWT9."
498271,501655,2013/6/21,5,Great flavorful dish!  As you suggested in the intro I used homemade turkey chorizo to lighten this up; I don&#039;t care for lima beans so left them out.  The nutty quinoa was a great base for the other textures and flavors.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
558429,501655,2013/10/23,4,I had a huge bag of quinoa from Costco so I was looking for some ways to use it. I used LightLife soy sausage and an entire package of frozen lima beans rather than two kinds of beans. I also added some cumin. We enjoyed this--thanks for posting!
163112,503587,2013/7/22,5,"DEEEELICIOUS!!  I made this for the &#039;Make Mine Vegan&#039; challenge in ZWT9.  I subbed olive oil for the butter &amp; soy crumbles for the hamburger.  I realized too late that I could have used quinoa.  I think TVP would work well, too.  For Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers!"
386585,505826,2013/8/20,5,"This was really delicious and fairly easy to put together, although it was very soupy.  I doubled the recipe, and used Japanese eggplant fresh from the farm!  I could not find the lime leaves, but added a dash of fresh lime juice.  When it came time to add the broth, I ended up only added 4 cups (instead of 6) and probably could have used just 2-3 to make it less soupy.  I served this with some jasmine rice.  This has wonderful flavor and will be made again.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
47892,498714,2013/4/11,5,"This whole time I thought brown sugar production involved boiling and distillieries and vats and a huge mess. No! In fact, I could have made this blindfolded. ;) We always use natural granulated sugar-sugar that has not been chemically bleached. For the molasses I added more because we prefer dark brown sugar for everyday use. I would suggest using a milder flavored molasses as the full flavored one was very intense. Thank you for posting this recipe!"
1818955,533272,2017/9/12,0,How much coffee??????
2430817,507731,2014/2/23,0,I made this tonight for our dinner.  My husband loved it.  Cornbread is a must-have with this very inexpensive meal.
1802715717,507731,2014/5/3,4,Lots of flavor added more garlic
1346746,507731,2014/12/2,4,Best cabbage dish I&#039;ve ever had!&lt;br/&gt;Only thing i did different was Used 2lb sausage and 2tsp minced garlic and roughly 20oz diced tomatoes and green chili&#039;s
1803730680,507731,2015/1/31,5,I had totally forgotten about this dish. Thanks so much for the simple recipe.
1802849661,507731,2015/2/17,4,"We loved this! I&#039;m not normally one for cabbage, but with the smoked sausage and tomatoes, this was delicious. My partner couldn&#039;t help but go for seconds!"
2000054603,507731,2015/3/10,5,"Love this recipe. Easy to prepare,easy on the budget and tastes great! Thanks for sharing it MSippigirl!"
628076,507731,2015/3/20,5,"Super tasty. I used Chinese cabbage and buttered onions so I reduced the butter. I added tomato juice, brought it to boiling then added minute rice and cooked until done. I served this with sweet cornbread. Thanks for a tasty and inexpensive dinner."
2001154347,507731,2016/9/4,5,This dish tasted wonderful and was easy to make and healthy all at the same time. We rushed right out and bought another cabbage. Can't wait to make it again!
2001247509,507731,2016/11/15,0,I just made this recipe and its out of this world!!! Inexpensive with ingredients I already have on hand!
2001249388,507731,2016/11/16,5,It was easy to make and tastes great! It will definitely be one of my go to meals from now on!
2001333103,507731,2017/1/2,5,Easy to make and my whole family loved it. Definitely will make again. I used turkey sausage and Rotel tomatoes. I also added two cloves of minced garlic. Great recipe!
2276604,507731,2017/2/28,5,Everyone loved it. Do you think it would be just as good with red cabbage? That's what I have in the fridge right now.
2001419520,507731,2017/3/5,5,Just made this and it's so easy and sooooo good. Thanks for the recipe we loved it
2001421609,507731,2017/3/7,5,I tried this it was real good. I put onions and green peppers in cabbage and sausage. Really good.
2000108694,507731,2017/3/14,0,My husband suggested breakfast sausage??? I don't believe so
2001439000,507731,2017/3/16,0,"Just made this. I threw in some turnips as well, leeks with the onions, real minced garlic-about 3 cloves, oregano, and 1/3 cup tarragon vinegar... Turned out fabulous! A winner Thanks for the recipe!"
2001119630,507731,2017/3/20,0,"Since the bacon, sausages, canned tomatoes (I don't know about the Tony Chachere's seasoning) are already heavily salted, I would suggestion using garlic powder, in place of garlic salt. Or as scotjonte suggested, fresh garlic."
2001393829,507731,2017/3/21,5,"Had polish kielbasa on hand, so used that instead of smoked sausage. So simple, and so delicious!"
2001542782,507731,2017/5/18,5,I used garlic powder instead and added fresh grated Parmesan on top! My picky 7 year old ate it up!
2001571166,507731,2017/6/24,5,Didn't have smoked sausage so used Italian. Added basil &amp; oregano. Will be making often!!
2001730455,507731,2017/9/26,5,I've been making this recipe exactly as stated minus the optional Tony Chachere seasoning. Our family was shocked at how good it was and it's one of my husband's favorites. its now on our regular rotation. Thank you for a great recipe.
1803160477,507731,2017/10/6,5,"Looks awesome, tastes awesome. Will add this to are recipes."
2000221825,507731,2017/10/20,5,This dish turned out great!!! The colors were wonderful and the taste delightful.
2001782382,507731,2017/11/7,5,"This was very good and so easy to prepare. I knew my family wouldn't eat it, but my co worker loved me for making and sharing it with her for a couple of lunches."
2001874810,507731,2017/12/21,5,Its great...loved it...
2001946744,507731,2018/1/22,5,Made this recipe as written and it was delicious. Thank you very much for sharing. I will definitely add this into our meal rotation.
2002036304,507731,2018/3/7,4,"Very easy to throw together. Didn't have Tony's seasoning. Used garlic salt, beef bullion granules, cumin, paprika, chili powder, pepper. Used canned diced tomatoes w/ green chilies and peels from one carrot( just because i had carrots) I liked it and will make it again next time i have cabbage. My boys, teens, won't be asking for this any time soon though so I'm still looking for the recipe that will make me want to buy cabbage again. This was the second recipe for one head of cabbage and i still have some left so the search continues"
2001975863,507731,2018/6/25,5,"Made this for supper today. At first I wasn't sure what to serve with it. Since I have fresh string beans from my favorite Farm Stand, I served with this dish. This is definitely a KEEPER. Since we like onions, I increased the onions and used red onions. The amount should be to your taste level. Used R Creole Seasoning since did not have Tony Cachere's Seasoning."
2002258433,507731,2018/8/26,0,I used both butter and bacon grease. Substituted stewed tomatoes since it's what I had. Used a touch of old Bay. Also added a leftover pork chop with grilled potatoes!
1745502,503818,2013/8/19,5,"Like most people, I didn&#039;t have any feggous, so I had to use cucumber. I also used fresh mint instead of parsley, and I was so glad I did. I think it was the lemon and the mint that made this salad somethng different than your normal cucumber tomato salad. Made for ZWT9."
107135,503818,2013/8/21,5,very fresh zwt9
305531,503818,2013/8/25,5,Very simple and good. Thanks diner for sharing. Made for ZWT9.
80353,503818,2013/9/2,5,Delicious and very fresh-tasting.  I went with the lemon juice and mint.  Perfect salad to serve with grilled meat (burgers in our case).
865936,503818,2014/11/2,5,"I made this with cucumber (never heard of feggous), lemon juice, and a combination of mint and parsley.  Refreshing and delicious!"
125356,507432,2013/11/27,5,Fantastic. You have a great dessert done in 8 minutes.
724631,507432,2013/12/1,0,"No stars at this time.  I made a half batch, and learned that this recipe requires trial and error before planning on offering to company.  I baked 3 in pyrex custard cups for 6 minutes, and let rest for 2 minutes.  I unmolded one an got a fabulous chocolate frosting.  So I put 1 of the cups back for 1 1/2 minutes, rested, and unmolded for a little progress.  Then I put the 3rd back in the oven to get up to 8 minutes, rested it, and unmolded it for a little more progress.  I put my 4th cup in the oven and baked for 9 minutes 10 seconds, and let it rest 2 minutes.  More cake had formed around the edges, but the cake would not come out of the cup in one swoop.  Another day, I will try with longer baking time.  Any suggestions?  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
37449,507432,2014/3/7,5,"I halved the recipe, and they turned out onto the plate nicely. There was a nice edge, but the inside was really liquidy. I thought it might need a few more minutes so put the rest back in the oven for 2 minutes. I put them in the fridge for tomorrow.   Thanks for a nice chocolaty dessert!"
2844561,499068,2013/5/29,5,"I mAde this dairy free, and I used tapioca and arrowroot starches instead.  Ia.soadded some garlic granules.  About 6&quot; diameter naans.  Loved the texture, loved how easy it was to handle.  Best gfcf naan I have tried yet!  Will be experimenting  with no eggs and more wholegrain flours!"
1802475277,499068,2014/2/10,5,"I liked the basic recipe but wanted to stay away from potato starches, cornstarches and rice flours so I just substituted 1 cup coconut flour, 1 cup almond flour and 1/4 cup garbanzo bean flour.  It rolled nicely and froze well and worked well as a pizza base as well."
1802500543,499068,2014/2/18,0,I love this recipe thank you so much!! &lt;3
8603092,499068,2014/4/29,0,"My husband and I loved this  bread.  I have tried others in the past and was disappointed, this is a winner."
2000237738,499068,2015/5/31,5,"Super easy and soooooo delicious.   So good in fact, we no longer go out for Indian food because our naan is just as good! Definitely try it, you won&#039;t be disappointed."
2000359376,499068,2015/7/24,5,"I made this egg free by substituting two tablespoons ground flaxseed and four tablespoons warm water mixed and let sit for five mins. I also went dairy free w cashew milk, a little less than 1/2 c. This recipe is the BOMB! We made whole foods&#039; Dal with it.  Very yummy! And we saved a lot of money...indian food is expensive!"
2000340562,499068,2015/8/5,5,"It was good but I&#039;m not sure I did this correctly...  The recipe didn&#039;t say what to do with the cooking oil, so I used it in the skillet to fry the naan.  The finished product tasted something like a Dough-boy from the fair  :-)"
1800147026,499068,2015/8/17,5,Really like this recipe.  As one reviewer stated the recipe does not mention where to add the oil.  Because of the order of the ingredients I added the oil to the recipe with the eggs.  I also spread the dough onto parchment paper and cooked on a hot grill.  Cook a minute or so on the paper then you can just slide the bread directly onto the grill to finish cooking.  Flip over to cook both sides.  I mad esome the traditional way with the butter but also left some plain and made pizza.
2001081533,499068,2016/7/9,5,"I have just found this recipe - it is the best ever gluten free naan bread - in fact it is the best ever gluten free ANY bread. I added the oil with the wet ingredients. I will also be making pizza base with this mix. Thank you, thank you!"
2001437866,499068,2017/3/15,1,"This was impossible to roll, sooooo sticky, didn't resemble dough at all, it was horrible."
2001546980,499068,2017/5/21,5,Made as per recipe with rice milk &amp; vinegar for buttermilk. Fried it dry so didn't use oil. Best gluten free naans I have made. Will be deleting my other recipes.
2001628470,499068,2017/7/16,1,"This is such a flop. The instructions leave so many questions unanswered, like when to use the oil (assumed it was for the pan) or how hot to heat the pan? Following the instructions I ended up with rubbery naan that is SO greasy I don't even want to touch it, let alone eat it. I tried cooking some dry and ended up with utterly flour covered dry naan. I tried cooking with half the oil and still they ended up too greasy. I tried wiping the pan lightly with oil and ended up with splotches of dryness and grease. And none of it helped the texture."
2002112481,499068,2018/4/14,5,Fast and tastiest recipe I’ve tried. Followed the recipe with no issues. This will be my go-to Naan bread recipe from now on.
799622,510995,2014/2/27,5,Absolutely excellent vegetarian recipe - I am not a vegetarian and I loved it!
2000265405,522053,2015/6/12,5,Really easy to make... and so tasty too.  I tend to look at these recipes and decide weather to make slight changes if I don&#039;t have all the ingredients.  So I changed the fenugreek leaves for powder (two teaspoons) Used a garlic Dolmio and a half cup of orange juice instead of water to wet the sauce.  Finally added about a dozen button mushrooms.  Delicious! :)
200339,493465,2014/10/20,5,"Hubby said it was great, thumbs up!!"
286566,503851,2013/7/31,4,"I mainly made this for the DH, scaling back for 1 pie and he thought it was o&#039;kay but I also had a very small slice and really enjoyed the flavours and the textures, I would have maybe liked a bit more lemon flavour so would consider adding the zest of 1/2 or whole lemon; also I used arrowroot biscuits and though I baked them as directed I honestly don&#039;t think you need to.  Also out of habit I lines my pie dish aluminium foil.  Thank you Tisme for posting, made for Make My Recipe tag game."
266635,511926,2018/6/23,5,"Lots of steps, but once you get going -- it comes together pretty quickly. I must say that I marinated the chicken overnight and I grilled it the day before I made the tikka masala. Love the flavor of the grilled chicken and I plan to use this marinade often just for grilled Indian chicken alone. I remove the meat from the bone the following day and prepared the sauce which came together quickly with a nice flavor and heat level. Served it over rice with Naan bread on the side. Served it with an Indian Spinach Salad on the side. Lovely dinner and well worth the effort."
163112,512528,2014/2/10,4,"I made a double batch for dinner tonight.  It was good but not WOWEE.  After 45 minutes it was very well done, so I added another 2c water to bring it back to soup consistency.  The yogurt gave it a nice, creamy richness.  Thank you!  Made for A Culinary Tour of Yemen in the NA/ME Forum 2/14."
1803061344,518051,2014/8/22,0,"I fell in love the very first bight, the almond flower gives it an awesome flavor and who does not t like cherry&#039;s what a wonderful mix they have my 5 star rating, a must try &lt;br/&gt;thank you for sharing this delight &lt;br/&gt;Gary"
2000216990,529383,2016/12/16,0,"This is magnificent! In days gone by I used to win awards for my gingerbread creations. There's a much easier way to make the glass windows though. Simply purchase lollipops in the colour/s you are looking for and grind them in a coffee grinder. Then spoon a thin layer onto a lightly greased foil lined baking sheet, slightly overlapping the outlines that you have drawn. Bake in an oven just until they melt. Cool, remove and &quot;glue&quot; to the back of the gingerbread structure with royal icing. Makes fabulous stained glass windows as well if you use multiple colours."
2002318895,529383,2018/11/1,5,You are a recent discovery! Thank you for sharing how you design your wonderful creations. Every detail is inspiring!
482376,505613,2013/8/15,5,My son could not get enough of this chicken stir-fry. I&#039;d rate that a success. It was flavorful and had a really great blend of ingredients. The bonus was that it was easy to prepare! Thank you for posting. Made for the Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9
128473,505613,2014/4/29,5,"Wow, bethie, did we ever enjoy this dish.  It was so tasty.  Best of all it was quick and easy to make, with ingredients I always have in the house...big  bonus for me.  It was so flavorful and had great textures.  I served it over wide noodles for a lovely treat. Made exactly as written but omitted the bean sprouts, (I don&#039;t like them).  The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was lovely.  We enjoyed the way all the flavors blended together to create a unique taste. Thank you for sharing one of our favorite dishes."
852554,503765,2013/7/24,5,"This was delicious - ya Michael Smith!!  Maybe I didn&#039;t brown my roux long enough, but I found my gumbo quite thick!  My package of shrimp was about double and I had about 50% more sausage.  Thanks Boomette - I always wanted to try to make it and I found a winner!  Made for ZWT 9"
2942502,503765,2014/10/5,3,"I&#039;ve been cooking gumbo for about 25 years, being from the deep south and all.  I decided to try a new recipe and this one was different, so I chose it.  I gave this one three stars for several reasons.  First, the roux was way too much and created a think gumbo.  Gumbo was not intended to be thick..that would be creole.  I ended up adding twice as much chicken stock as called for in order to thin it out.  Second, I used twice as much shrimp as called for since I like to have shrimp in my shrimp gumbo...every bite.  Third, although I appreciated the spices, I chose to add in some more.  I used Old Bay since the shrimp were not boiled prior to adding them, and boiling shrimp in some type of seasoning is a necessity!  With this said, the flavor was good and after we drained some of the roux/chicken liquid, we had a good gumbo.  If you like a chicken flavored thick gumbo, this is your dish."

169430,506719,2014/5/31,5,"I made half of the recipe using about 1.5 Tbsp of the vinegar to keep the mix pretty thick. I used it as an open face sandwich sprinkling the cheese, nuts and red onion on top. It was really yummy on lightly toasted rye bread and Recipe #356135 on the side. I might mention too, that I used 95% fat free cream cheese and 0% fat Liberte Greek yogurt and 1 tsp Splenda for the sugar. Thank you Nancy for a great recipe."
461834,506719,2014/7/7,5,"This was great salad/dip!!!  I only made 1/2 of the recipe and it still made a bowl full of dip!!!  I served it with celery, carrots and wafer crackers, as our appetizer before our BBQ lunch.   My son&#039;s girlfriend really enjoyed the dip and thought it was much better then the standard broccoli/bacon salads.  The only changes I made was to sub toasted slivered almonds and a fat-free Greek yogurt.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!"
226863,509959,2014/6/3,5,"Ultra creamy and cheesy!  This is really easy and quick to make, especially if your chicken is already cooked.  I halved the recipe, and I think it could of still filled up a 9 x 13 inch pan!  Makes a lot, but it is delicious, so we were happy to have the leftovers.  I subbed minced garlic for the garlic powder."

204024,501590,2013/7/21,5,Super delicious and melted in our mouths.   These were a wonderful experience.   Made for ZWT9.  These are going in my favorites for 2013.
1590918,501590,2015/7/3,5,"Oh my, these are good!!!  Made these for Father&#039;s Day and served with Cafe Au Lait.  Outstanding!  My husband was thrilled.  I followed the receipt exactly.  Her instructions are simple and great.  Best we&#039;ve had since tasting at Cafe du Monde.  

Be sure that you plan your time and allow for the dough to rise.  You need to start at least 3 hours before you plan to fry and serve.  Initial time for dough to rise is at least two hours.  After you punch it down, roll and cut it you must wait another 20 or 30 minutes for it to rise again.  Your hands on time is minimal but you can&#039;t do it without the wait time."
2000785270,520940,2017/1/6,5,"This is an excellent recipe; flavor is spot on. The rice vinegar, soy sauce, ginger and ground white pepper give this soup an incredible Asian flavor. I sauteed celery, julienned red pepper, sliced mushrooms with white onion instead of leeks. I also used chicken broth and water as I didn't have the veggie broth. Didn't have savoy cabbage either, so I used baby bok choy, baby spinach and baby kale salad mix for the &quot;cabbage&quot;. I also spiralized some thick zucchini noodles and threw those in with the shrimp the last 3-5 minutes. I topped with a handful of fresh bean sprouts. This has amazing fresh flavor. Thanks Jackie!"
2001438552,504720,2017/7/8,5,I made them with tinned mango in syrup (1and a half tins) I didn't have to add any sugar or lemon juice and they are delicious. I blitzed it just enough so no big bits but not completely pureed as like the odd juicy chunks
2324285,493945,2013/2/3,5,"This is a great way to serve cauliflower, which I'm not a huge fan of as it just isn't the most flavorful of vegetables.  Roasting it with the thyme, onions, and vegetables works well, and this recipe has turned me into a cauliflower fan!  Thanks for sharing [made and reviewed for Please Review My Recipe]"
32058,493945,2014/12/30,5,The best way to make cauliflower... Incredible!
1706426,507151,2013/10/13,5,I used unpeeled fingerling potatoes and I did cut the recipe down. This is a great brunch recipe! I think it could easily be be prepared the night before and baked in the morning. Thanks for sharing this gem! Made for PRMR
125356,507151,2013/11/16,5,It was a hit!! Followed the recipe to a T. Wouldn&#039;t change a thing.
103809,516126,2015/3/28,5,"I love this.  It&#039;s easy to assemble the packets, is really delicious, and easy to clean up.  I like to serve it with broccoli and maybe some heated french bread with butter."
2597942,515624,2014/5/14,5,"I&#039;m basing my review solely on the chops and flavor. I had 4 pork chops thawed in my fridge, and was looking for a quick recipe to whip up tonight. I used 2 of the chops to make a citrus marinated chop recipe (for another night), and I used the other 2 chops to make this recipe tonight. I have to say, this was a great way to make chops. They turned out very moist and tender (for being made in a skillet). I browned them for approx 4 mins per side. I tented them on a platter with foil and then sauteed the onion for about 7 mins. I continued the rest of the recipe as directed (heating chops about 5 mins in gravy). I can say that I was not thrilled with the Quick Grits (&quot;Quaker&quot; 5-minute White Hominy Grits), NO fault of the recipe, but I think next time I would make cheesy mashed potatoes or rice. (Just my opinion). Thanks for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
1620171,497512,2014/1/14,5,This was lovely. I used a little too much chicken stock and discovered this would also make a lovely soup with the type of pasta used. I loved the leek and garlic in this too. Thanks for a delicious meal.
284897,503005,2013/7/23,5,"This is a very quick and easy salad, with such great flavours.&lt;br/&gt;I made this for DS knowing he would love it and demolish the whole lot on his own....And he did! I did add just a hint of chili for him as he loves chili. The only comment he made that was negative was the orange was a little too sweet, so next time I will use a less ripe orange, as the one I used was fairly ripe.&lt;br/&gt;A great salad Lavender Lynn, which I will be making again."
527607,503005,2015/3/5,5,Delicious and so easy to make. I normally do my avocados with just lemon juice and salt but this brought them to a gourmet level
2002019587,499436,2018/2/27,5,"This turned out amazing and I will be making it again. I put a organic ketchup, brown rice syrup and coconut palm sugar on top as the glaze. It tastes better than the &quot;meat or turkey&quot; meatloaf I made when I was eating meat. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. LOVE IT!!"
869525,499436,2018/3/28,2,"My loaf didn't hold up at all. It was like a TVP crumble. Flavor was okay, after I added salt. I won't be making this again."
2001536450,499436,2018/10/29,0,It is a fantastic recipe but the flax seed has to be very fine and (i noted) better if one adds an egg. However you could try more flax seed powder
2000876229,493748,2016/12/9,5,This is a wonderful recipe. Would be great with just about any mild fish. So simple and flavorful. I use Swai instead of salmon and it was excellent.
895132,513684,2014/8/10,5,"Yum! Clear five stars, these are soo good! I halved the sugar - personal preference - and the bourbon and mint flavour both come out, neither of them overpowering, very subtle, but oh so good! I used gluten free flour (1/3 brown rice flour, 1/3 millet flour, 1/3 cornstarch) but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Thanks for sharing this winner!"
452355,503009,2013/7/18,4,"I appreciated a posting for vegetarian dirty rice.  The recipe itself was not difficult to make, though it did require a bit of clean up in terms of dirty pans.  DH and I thought it was good, just a little on the bland side for our tastes.  I think this could be remedied by either adding some additional cajun spices or adjusting the proportions of the ones posted to suit your personal preferences.  I actually served this as a side dish to black bean enchiladas, but it could easily be a main dish.  Made for ZWT9."
697161,493822,2013/1/29,5,This recipe was delicious. Don't let the WW name fool you because it is full of flavor. I personally upped the spices because I am used to restaurant style Indian food.Serve it with some white rice or pita bread and you'll love it.
639261,493822,2013/3/18,3,"This is a nice easy recipe with good flavoring.  I too doubled up on the spices as it definitely neede a little more kick for me but overall easy, healthy, and good."
2844455,500329,2013/5/29,5,OMG! what a great burrito or enchilada!!! It didn&#039;t reallly take that long to prepare. I get hme at 5 pm and we were eating by 6:00 after I rested! My husband and daughters loved! This is the 1!!!
452355,504317,2013/8/21,5,"I made this dish for my lunch today.  I used red lentils, as that was what I had on hand.  I found this to be very easy to make with minimal prep.  I did have to adjust the finished dish to include quite a bit more salt and pepper to taste and about 2 more pinches of cumin to get it how I liked it.  I sampled multiple bites of lentils in the pan before serving them over the couscous.  I actually preferred the dish without the couscous.  Thanks for an enjoyable lunch that I will enjoy for leftovers tomorrow.  Made for ZWT9"
133174,504317,2014/4/29,5,Made for dinner using brown lentils.  So easy to make. The lentils were served over saffron rice to make this a gluten free meal along with sliced tomatoes and papadums for a filling meal.  Made for Aussie Swap.
2001310706,504317,2016/12/21,2,"I see the good reviews, but for me, the measurements seem to be really off on the spices because it came out super bland. I needed to add more salt, garlic, cumin, etc. I also added diced tomatoes. The onions were a little weird cut into slices so I ended up chopping them as well,I made some flat bread to go with as I thought it needed some texture. The ratio of lentil mixture to couscous was off. It made very little couscous compared to the lentils so that the serving sizes seemed off. Just my opinion."
2000061592,520520,2015/3/14,1,It was not thick. Too runny. Not like a pudding or mousse at all. Basically just a chocolate soup.
557649,511266,2013/12/25,0,"Yes, Rai.  It IS a Pennsylvania Dutch stuffing.  I was born in Pennsylvania, so had it growing up and still make it every now and then.  Thanks for the recipe and the memories!  Is Good Stuff!"
42299822,511266,2014/4/11,0,I am sorry but this is not Pennsylvania Dutch/Amish potato stuffing.....you take onions  w/ a small amount of oil and saut&eacute; till almost clear  then add the hearts livers and gizzards cook till almost done then take raw cubed potato&#039;s and add them in add the celery when almost done tare up 6 pieces of bread and add them and at the very end take off the heat and add one egg and mix in...add salt pepper and parsley while cooking...my family is from about 20 miles out side of Lancaster PA and that is how we have always done it and how everyone I know does it just wanted to give the accurate recipe
1802770197,516545,2014/6/15,5,Made this today for family. Everyone not only said how great it was but said it was so pretty as well. I was going to take a picture but everyone wanted to eat right away because they said the smell of the cooking made them extra hungry. I will have to post a picture next time I make it because there will definitely be a next time. And Tabasco was correct when she said it was very easy but elegant enough for company.  Way to go Tabasco. This is my second attempt at your recipes and I&#039;ve loved them both. I will be trying more of your recipes in the future
2001740466,533718,2017/10/4,5,"Who the heck knew you could bake donuts?! I LOVE apple cider donuts, but I really hate deep frying things (plus they're not very good the next day). These however, were delicious AND guilt free. Also, I didn't have apple cider so I used apple juice and it was still really good. The only bad thing is that they were so yummy, my husband, my mom and I ate all 12 before I could snap a picture :( Will be making these again for Halloween treats for my fam. Thanks for the easy to follow recipe, Ashley!"
80353,503230,2013/8/2,4,"This would have been 5-star for me, but without the tomato paste, which I thought just tasted &#039;off&#039; combined with the other ingredients.  Loved the cheese/marm combo - but I always do!"
47892,505710,2013/8/25,5,"My last tagged recipe for ZWT 9 and I think my favorite one! I used a bunch of vegetables from our weekly CSA box: lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes as well as fresh cilantro and basil also from the box. The dressing is worth five stars on its own (local honey, too!). The only thing I would do differently next time is to not toss any of the vegetables with the dressing and only add the dressing just before serving. For me, it has a better presentation that way. The salad was our main dish and was accompanied by freshly steamed bi-color corn on the cob and a platter of watermelon. Made for ZWT 9 and enjoyed immensely! Thanks for posting."
2001740552,533718,2017/10/5,5,Very cool! Good time of year for everyone apple picking to make something fun for the family. or for their office.....i hope someone from my office reads this! : ) Ashley is a natural up there and Akilah is hilarious and fun to watch. Can't wait to see the next episode.
498271,502795,2013/7/14,5,"Great way to make your morning coffee special!  I did add a spoonful of sugar to tone down the bitterness of the chicory flavor a bit.  Love coffee this way - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
461834,502795,2013/7/15,5,"Great pick me up mid morning today!!  I made this as written, using &quot;French Market&quot; chicory coffee, 2% milk and the heavy cream, and just like loof, I added 1 packet of &quot;Equal&quot; to the coffee.    It is a very strong coffee, so having the large amount of cream and sweetner really makes for a great coffee!!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
1706426,502795,2013/7/17,5,Very good! Nice and creamy and I just happened to have a can of New Orleans style chicory  coffee! Perfect morning pick me up! Made for ZWT9
895132,502795,2013/7/17,5,"Wonderful caf&eacute; au lait! I don&#039;t get the ready made New Orleans style coffee here, so I mixed regular coffee and chicory in a 50 percent ratio. For the milk I used goat&#039;s milk and for the heavy cream almond cream. This made a wonderful blend, I love the nutty, malty bitterness of the chicory. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Cajun for The Apron String Travelers"
128473,502795,2013/7/17,5,"I love cafe au lait and this charming recipe is no exception.  Wow, was this good; dark, bold,  rich and creamy. I love the nutty slightly bitter flavor of the chicory in the coffee.  I bought a small can of coffee that already had chicory in it, this worked really well. With the cream, milk and sugar this coffee was the bomb. Thanks so much for sharing. Made for ZWT9 - Panthers on the Prowl."
37449,502795,2013/7/18,5,"So nice. I used to drink chicory coffee alot back in the day, so this was brought back memories. Much enjoyed, thanks! Made for ZWT by a Hot Stuff."
47559,502795,2013/7/21,5,Yum!  All I needed was the beignets to transport me back to Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  The Community Coffee brand with chicory is sold here and is nearly as good as the Cafe du Monde blend. I really enjoyed this treat.  Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers for ZWT9.
340141,502795,2013/7/21,3,"I was able to find Cafe du Monde Coffee and Chicory.   However, since I don&#039;t have a coffee brewer or even press, I had to look up how to do this without one.   I poured boiling water over it; steeped three minutes; stirred; steeped another three minutes.   I then poured it through a very fine strainer into a cup that already contained the heated milk and cream.  (Missed the part about pouring together.)   Aak.   BITTER.   I don&#039;t know how much of this is my stupid brewing method or the chicory, as other people have commented that chicory is indeed bitter.  However, it grew on me as I drank the cup.    I do enjoy having a coffee drink with only some caffeine, however, versus a full load of it.   I&#039;m not feeling jittery at all.   It&#039;s about like tea if terms of impact.   ZWT9"
480195,502795,2013/8/29,4,"Yikes! This will certainly get you wide awake in the morning. First time I ever tried coffee with chicory. I love coffee and usually drink about 3 cups of black coffee per day. I couldn&#039;t drink it without adding a package of Splenda, and even then I think this is an acquired taste."
1802570336,513010,2014/3/10,5,Easy to make and very tasty. We have them once a week.

I have to say that I&#039;ve used a splash of vodka in hot cocoa before, but I honestly didn&#039;t think of using &quot;Chocolate&quot; flavored vodka. I used &quot;Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka&quot; brand. Delicious! I toasted the marshmallows on wooden shish-kabob sticks over the gas burner on the stove (and of course I set one on fire)...  And again, I have always used marshmallows, but I never thought to &quot;toast&quot; the marshmallows before. Such a fun and unique cocktail. I think this will make my winter fav&#039;s list, also.

I did cheat and poured a bit of pure maple syrup over the top.  I also sprouted my lentils before I cooked them.  I&#039;ve heard different opinions on whether or not sprouting makes much of a difference.  This is a nice option for gluten free, grain free, and dairy free people."

2776673,502389,2014/4/21,4,"This was an excellent dish!  My first review--it takes a lot to make me move lately ( just retired).  The sauce is to die for ; for that alone the recipe sings. I have made many versions of this sauce, but this was the best. I used the cornstarch to add extra thickness as suggested.  The chicken was also very good.  I think the panko I bought was coarser than other brands and made the coating to like &quot;cereal topping&quot;.  I will use a more refined panko next time.  The sauce was used the nest day over burgers.  Everyone wanted me to &quot;patent&quot; the sauce but I told them I didn&#039;t have &quot;proprietary&quot; rights for the recipe (LoL).  Great recipe.  Thanks for posting mmm1"
2000201276,502389,2015/5/13,5,"I signed up so I can log in and write a review saying that the sauce was the most amazing sauce I have ever made. I finished eating this only 30 minutes ago and was compelled to write this. 

I didn&#039;t have Worcestershire sauce and that was for the best because the sauce turned out absolutely delicious...even my husband said we should keep this recipe and use it for BBQ sauce. One substitute I made in the sauce was using brown sugar instead of white sugar."
340141,505590,2013/8/24,4,"I really enjoyed this.   It was comfort food.  I used boneless, skinless thighs.  They were finished in only 10 minutes compared to 30 for the bone-in ones.   I would have given this five stars, but DH wouldn&#039;t finish it.   He wanted gravy over it.   Uh, no.   I served it over rice because I wanted to round out the meal and soak up every bit of the broth.   This actually seemed pretty close to Iranian cuisine to me compared to North African, but whatever.   It was a very good dinner.  ZWT9"

315565,503812,2013/8/25,4,"This made a nice big cake and you can certainly taste the orange in this cake, but not the almond  essence . I used 2 blood oranges and followed the recipe totally. The cake baked well, rose nicely and cut beautifully with good texture. It does need a little something on the side after day 1 so we had vanilla custard with it. Made for ZWT 9"

I am sitting here eating one and wishing that I  would have made the whole batch, I halved the recipe and got 20 beautiful crisp cookies that are blasting with coconut flavor.  Just perfect for dh and me.  I won&#039;t be sharing any of these tasty little gems.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, which has gone into my keeper box.

It is a great recipe to take to church for a crowd or, what I did yesterday, share it with a neighbor. This recipe makes a lot of pasta salad. I love watching The Pioneer Woman.

DH and I differed over whether the pesto should have been added on the crust first (rather than in dollops once it was out of the oven), but I liked the recipe as written.  The only changes I made was to add some olives and roasted red bell peppers to the sundried tomatoes and artichokes.  Will definitely make this again!  Made for PRMR, June, 2013."
226863,501079,2014/1/17,5,"Yum!  I spread the pesto on the crust, then followed the instructions exactly.  My sun dried tomatoes got a little burnt, but it still tasted great!  Maybe the ones packed in oil would have been a better choice and not gotten to brown.  Very good pizza!  I&#039;ll make it again and probably rub some roasted garlic on the crust as well as add black olives.  Thanks for sharing!! Made for PRMR tag"
2001350460,529216,2017/1/14,4,"It was a good first start, but a bit bland, even with a hearty sauce. For second time, I spiced it up a bit, adding an Italian blend of seasoning to the rice. I also found that I liked it better when I used grated mozzarella and hand pressed a little piece to fold into the center. It broke down, a bit, when baked, and could be better distributed in several bites."

724631,503914,2013/9/1,3,"Proportions off, and did not fit Chef Super Skillet, please see my rating system.  I have a chef&#039;s super pot, which can handle oversized wok dishes.  This recipe was for 6-8 servings, and should have fit the pot. (If only I had used my 6.75-quart Dutch oven!)  4 cups of uncooked rice and 8 cups chicken broth  were too much in proportion to the chicken and sausage, and they raised the ingredients/liquid level to less than 1/4&quot; of the top.  As a result, I had to leave the top cock-eyed so the pot wouldn&#039;t boil over; it took an additional 15 minutes to cook the dish.  In the end, there was a vast amount of rice for the protein.  Unless you have a lot of &quot;starving students&quot;, cut the rice down to 3 cups, and the chicken broth down to 6 cups.  The recipe&#039;s step 1 asked to &quot;heat the oil in a skillet.&quot; No oil was mentioned in the ingredients.  Next measuring quandary: in step 2, the chicken was to be sprinkled with Cajun seasoning, was this the same seasoning listed under the cayenne pepper?  I used the 1/2 Tbsp. Cajun seasoning in a bag to shake the chicken cubes for distribution.  Then as the chicken cooked, I sprinkled more seasoning.  I wish the recipe had given better instruction.  I shook on some gumbo file, which was  a valuable contribution to this dish. Next time I would use a more interesting sausage and reduce the uncooked rice to 3 cups.  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
2734669,503914,2013/11/4,5,"My wife was hounding me to use up the left over chicken and some smoked sausage that we had in the fridge. I typed in those two ingredients and found this recipe. What a great recipe. It tasted great. We only had green bell pepper (not a mixture of colors), but with the onion it worked out well. I did cut the rice to 3c and broth down to 6c to make the dish blend better (meat to rice), but when feeding a crowd I understand the logic behind it. I did take the advice and use a small Dutch oven to prepare this. We will make this again. Thanks, Rosie."
266635,503914,2014/3/13,4,"We enjoyed this jambalaya-style chicken and sausage.  I scaled the recipe back to 2 servings -- as it&#039;s just me and DH.  Even though the recipe was from Justin Wilson, I have to say that I missed having some crushed tomatoes and/or tomato paste which may not be conventional, but none-the-less they are ingredients that we generally add to this type of dish.  I also added less cayenne as I used a spicy sausage.  Made for PRMR, March, 2013."
2000431901,537071,2018/11/6,4,"The flavor of the soup was wonderful, but I found the texture to be rather like glue. I think it's from using Yukon gold potatoes. I would try this again with Russets."
131126,498572,2013/4/21,5,"This is yummy and I appreciated a recipe that made breakfast easy to put together. I toasted the walnuts and made the spread the evening before.   I liked the combination of ingredients and the sweet spread would add a nice flavor with any dry toast.  I used a mandolin to thin slice an apple, but I am looking forward to trying this with peaches or nectarines. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
2002110955,535282,2018/4/14,5,It was the Best Apple dip ever!!!
2002173957,535282,2018/6/3,5,It was the Best Apple dip ever! I ended up making 2 batches because my kids ate all of the first one. I will absolutely make it again!!!!!
383346,500070,2013/5/19,5,So simple but very yummy.  My son liked this tuna sandwich so much.  Thanks kamikazeskunk :)  Made for New Kids on the block tag game
690623,510905,2014/8/13,5,We have a winner!  I am not a &#039;lives for bacon&#039; gal but DH loves it so I gave this recipe a try.  I used bone in chops as a personal preference and because they were about 3/4&quot; thick I jacked the temperature to 425 for 20 minutes.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was just perfect with the bacon nicely done but not at all burned and the pork still moist.  This recipe will  be made frequently.  I also had a slice of onion with it.   Thanks for posting!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
10404,510905,2014/9/24,5,Love this recipe!  I used pork loin chops-after saucing and wrapping my husband grilled them!  Really moist which almost never happens with loin chops!  Fast recipe to put together-bonus!  Made for CQ2014
157425,510905,2015/8/29,5,"BBQ, bacon, and pork chops what more can be said!   :)  My DH  was in heaven! He did grill the chops and I didnt have fresh rosemary so I added a sprinkle or two  of dried to the bbq sauce. Made the six pork chops for two us so we could enjoy leftovers too. Charmie we will be making these again! Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest ."
305531,510905,2015/8/30,5,Very flavorful chops that were simple to prepare. Thanks Charmie for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2.
128473,510905,2015/9/2,5,"|My dh was over the moon.  He absolutely loved this recipe.  I used pork tenderloin, it worked great, and was moist, tender and juicy.  Otherwise made exactly as written.  The pork was so flavorful, I used a homemade BBQ sauce from the Quest, so good. Served with Texas Coleslaw, Fried Green Tomatoes, Sour Cream &amp; Chive Biscuits and Texas Style Garlic Mashed Potatoes for a memorable meal.   Made for CQ2 - Texas"
34122,510905,2017/6/29,5,These were easy and delicious. At first I misunderstood the directions and wrapped the chops with bacon and then slathered with barbecue sauce. When I realized my mistake I removed the bacon and turned it over to put the sauce on the chops. Yes I was a mess. My chops were probably less than an inch and I found two strips of bacon were more than enough. Next time I will use just one. I used Kittencal's recipe for barbecue sauce from this site which is phenomenal. I will definitely make this again.
2002214664,510905,2018/7/11,5,"Well we all know I don't eat meat but I made this for the rest of the family, had mashed potatoes and salad with it... Kid tested, kid approved ?? Super easy, even for me to make ??"
2002183523,510905,2018/7/26,5,"I made this for my husband because I was tired of making the same old pork chop recipe. He was very happy with this despite picking off the bacon and eating it first. &quot;It's bacon wrapped. I have to unwrap it&quot;, he tells me. This was fast and super easy even though it set off my smoke detector while broiling. I used boneless thick-cut chops and I found that two slices of bacon were perfect. I will be adding this to our dinner repertoire rotation. Thank you so very much!"
2002348686,510905,2018/11/25,5,Well it's bacon wrapped pork chops...I mean.. Come on..I tweaked it .I used a brown sugar with Cayenne and chili powder rub.. Will probably serve with Russell's ghost pepper BBQ sauce.. I'm a pepper head lol.. But this BBQ sauce if you can find it is probably about the best on the market really balanced.. Not all heat.. But it's there
58104,501158,2013/6/21,5,I was surprised only one made an ice cream recipe for this contest.  I did myself have an ice cream recipe made the contest. I glad I didn&#039;t post it.  I don`t eat it often and when I do I like to know what goes into it. This ice cream is creamy rich. My DH really liked it. He gives it 4-5 stars. I myself loved that it called for honey!!!!! I give it 5 stars. Thanks. Good luck!
160977,501158,2013/6/22,5,"So creamy, rich and delicious. Used honey from our befriended bee-keeper and strong dark rum. The raisins gives the little twist. Very good indeed. Thanks for creating and posting. Made for Raiders of the Lost Pantry Contest."
592637,520329,2015/1/9,0,Did you forget to add &quot;crabmeat&quot; to the recipe?
169430,501158,2013/6/22,3,"We liked this ice cream but both thought the honey and rum came on a bit too strong. I used the ask for dark rum and a generic honey. Our personal opinion was that the honey could be cut in half and sugar (or splenda) used for the other 1/4 cup of sweetening and possibly using white rum  would be better for us. That said, the ice cream has a smooth creamy, I could even say velvety, texture and the raisins are yummy."
2001601754,516489,2017/6/27,0,"? Something is not right. The recipe lists 20 oz of liquid (16 + 4). The instructions say to add 8 oz of tea and 2 oz of lemonade = 10 oz per serving. The heading says &quot;Servings: 4&quot;, but 20/10 = 2 servings..."
2002235654,516489,2018/7/31,0,Can you use any lemonade or a specific lemonade
2000962575,497959,2016/4/7,4,"This is the fifth time I&#039;m making it. 
I must admit I have made some adjustments, but just to the dumplings (they were a bit too heavy):
- Just 2-4 spoons of the olive oil (or butter if I want it enriched)
- Flat leaf parsley, instead of tarragon / rosemary
- plain unbleached flour and yeast
After the dough doubled, I have worked it out a bit and then, made dumplings and let them sit in cold place ready to be put on the stew when the stew is about to go to the oven. It takes 10 more minutes in the oven (55&#039;).
In this way, I could time the meal for the guests. 
It never fails and this is really very nice meal.
Thank you for the recipe!"
2324285,512016,2014/1/28,4,"A good chutney!  The small amount of spices really go a long way in this recipe- it was just right.  Very nice apple flavors, and it&#039;s not too sweet."
2722551,496087,2013/3/9,0,Amazing recipe! It's like a page out of a paleo diet cookbook that I am currently following. I love it! The healthy great-tasting food without the harmful long term effects and with all the health benefits that you can imagine.<br/><br/>And I am surely adding the cheese in there for good measure.
2067245,492741,2013/5/7,0,&quot;We&#039;ll be doing&quot;
825663,492741,2013/5/21,0,"I made these for my Mother this year but substituted Almond Butter for the Peanut Butter and everyone loved them. If I make them again, I&#039;ll be sure and lightly sprinkle the shavings. I was a little heavy handed and it clumped."
1925885,502888,2017/8/30,4,These were good but the batter to potato proportion was off - as you couldn't really see the potatoes in the finished cakes. Maybe removing moisture from the grated potatoes instead of grating directly into the batter would help? Or maybe my medium potatoes were too small and there wasn't enough potatoes... Served these with a dollop of sour cream and a small bit of tart cherry preserves.
305531,502888,2017/8/30,5,"These were good. I did have to add more flour to thicken the consistency. They were easy to prepare and the lingonberry preserves really went well with them. Thanks for sharing, Lynn. Made for CQ4."
226867,502888,2017/9/5,5,"Based on earlier reviews, I did a couple of things. I weighed my potato (I had one large russet potato). It weighed 12 oz, so 3/4 pound. I grated it and wrapped it in paper towels and squeezed a surprising amount of liquid out of it. I used about 1/4 cup flour, 1 egg (didn't want to have part of an egg to deal with later), and about 1/4 cup milk. The consistency seemed right. They turned out very good although I still miss my gas stove - much easier to control heat on gas! So, my ingredients were the same, but my proportions were a bit off! Served with lingonberry preserves and applesauce. Delish! made for my captain CQ4"
363055,501601,2013/6/17,5,Very tasty shrimp.  I liked this a lot.
96796,493874,2013/3/5,5,"I thought these would be a total flop, considering how difficult it was just to get them off my hands and onto the cookie sheet; but I just ate one fresh from the oven, and it was delicious!  I did add walnuts (equal to the amount of chocolate chips), and I would recommend them if allergies aren't a concern.  Next time I may leave my hands a bit wet or use two spoons to prevent the batter from sticking to my hands.  Thanks for posting!"
2001950784,493874,2018/8/23,5,I&acute;ve made this recipe many many time (I bake them for a coffee shop) and they are great. My recommendations are: 1) Blend bananas (120 gr) + oil + sugar + vainilla + salt. In bowl mix all the other ingredients. Pour the banana mixture into de dry ingredientes and mix well. Proceed with the instructions. Ah! And use a small bowl with water while you wet your hands to flatten the dough balls.
2543186,523538,2015/10/6,5,"Excellent Recipe. Very tasty, tasted it in the office potluck.  Liked  the wrapping  and the layers of potato slices."
2000979404,523538,2016/4/19,2,"Expensive to make and too much bacon grease.   Be prepared with your turkey baster to suction it out or your oven will become a disaster.  The flavor is good, however and my son said it makes a terrific breakfast burrito filling.  If you like bacon grease-laden potatoes, this is a recipe for you.  I won&#039;t make it again."
2001217432,523538,2016/10/23,4,Added some fresh baby spinach between the layers. Leftovers keep well for a day or so and reheat ok in microwave. Great company brunch dish.
2001490383,523538,2017/4/15,5,"I have added love, spinach, onion and jalepeno. The dish is still delicious! Also you may want to consider thinly slicing small white and red potatoes. While it may take a little time with out special tool, at 400-450 it takes an hour!"
2001510031,523538,2017/4/27,0,I found this recipe awhile back on youtube and was looking for a refresher. My skillets are too small or too big so I use a glass pie pan. I won't buy a new pan for something I make once in awhile. It turns out great. My family calls it bacon pie....lol.
2001017106,523538,2017/6/4,0,What size skillet did everyone use? Is a 10&quot; cast iron too big?
2001970000,523538,2018/2/3,0,"I had to try this recipe as soon as I saw it. I just made the basic bacon, cheddar, potato recipe. We loved it. I will make this for special occasions, holidays. Can't get enough of this and I can now add more to this recipe to our liking."
1808020,496251,2014/5/22,1,"I am currently cooking this mixture in my slow cooker.  It has been cooking on High for over 2 hours.  Stirring as per directions did nothing but produce a thin yellow soup.  I have cooked slow cooker polenta before, and used a different recipe which required 6 to 8 hours to cook, on Low, 3-4 Hours on High.  I had my doubts about the &quot;Basic Polenta&quot; recipe when I read that it took only 2 1/2 - 3 hours to cook.  I&#039;m not a happy camper.  It is 8 p.m. No polenta.  P.S. - I found the other recipe.  It calls for BOILING liquid, 6 Cups to 2 Cups of cornmeal, slow cook on Low for 6 -8 Hours, on High for 3-4 Hours.  I added another 1/2 C. of cornmeal to the already cooking, now boiling hot, polenta mixture in my slow cooker and stirred it in well.  The mixture had already been cooking on High for 4 Hours and was still relatively soupy.  Hopefully, adding additional cornmeal will correct the recipe enough to produce a decent polenta in another hour or two.  &quot;Basic Polenta&quot; recipe needs to be corrected."
2000492574,513064,2015/9/23,5,This was the bomb!!!
2001243191,513064,2016/11/12,5,Consistently a family favorite!
1072593,513064,2017/1/2,5,rowr rowr rowr...that would be labeled in many circles as ‘scarfing’
2001438066,513064,2017/3/15,0,It was very good but if your like peppers soft you might want blanc pepper a little. I like them just way they were i dont like to soft peppers.
2001600298,513064,2017/6/26,5,"Made exactly per recipe, except with regular mushrooms and red peppers. Was absolutely delicious! My son informed me that this would definitely be on the &quot;make again&quot; list."
1019994,513064,2017/7/12,4,I was in the mood to try something a little different and gave these a shot. A pretty darn good little recipe and very easy.
2001668957,513064,2017/8/12,3,The peppers are too crunchy. It's yummy but if you don't want crunchy bell peppers you need to cook them before you add the mixture and melt the cheese.
2001717859,513064,2017/9/17,0,when baking put a little water in the bottom of your casserole dish do not put cheese on top yet cover first with aluminum foil and cook for 45 minutes so the green peppers are not crunchy. Then you can uncover for the the last 5 minutes you can put the cheese on until it melts and starts to Brown.
1926335,513064,2018/1/23,4,"This was really good, I did use thin slice provolone which reduced the calories, I also parboiled the peppers for 5 minutes."
2001063067,513064,2018/2/6,5,These were great! I would serve with a side of potato or rice and bread/rolls. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe.
2001990500,513064,2018/2/13,0,"It was good, I toasted buns and we had steak and cheese w/ peppers, I did pre cook peppers, very tasty!"
2002063536,513064,2018/3/28,4,"It was delicious! I followed someone else's suggestion of putting a thin layer of water in the dish and covering/cooking for 45 min. I'm making them tonight but this time I'm just going to sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top instead if another piece of provolone. When that provolone cooled, it got too thick."
2002099690,513064,2018/6/3,0,"Delicious, it keeps getting better. This time I parboiled the peppers instead of putting in oven.Then baked them!"
937635,506950,2013/11/5,1,This recipe needs work. I don&#039;t think it was properly tested. I&#039;ve made these mini chicken pot pies several times in the past but this recipe was off. There is too much filling for the 8 biscuits and the grands are too big to cook properly. I ended up using two cans of 8 biscuits and adjusted the baking time to 26 minutes and some were still doughy in the middle. I looked back into my reviews and found that the regular 7.5 ounce cans of biscuits (12 in a pack) work much better.
1800298041,506950,2013/11/23,5,I just finished my mini chicken pot pies they came out beautifull  pop out of the muffin pan like muffins . Thanks they&#039;re delisious.
1800558865,506950,2013/12/8,4,"I just finished my mini chicken potpies following this recipe. This recipe was very helpful, it does take a little common sense to tweak it when necessary. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it if you&#039;re not somewhat of a seasoned cook, with the ability to make adjustments when you see fit. Overall, I am pleased with the outcome and I will make them again in the future. Thanks for sharing!"
1800564384,506950,2013/12/9,0,Awesome recipe! My family loved it! I used fresh veggies and the bigger muffin pan. (6)   I also used the two extra biscuits to make an X across the top of each pot pie. Enjoy!
1800199313,506950,2014/1/30,4,"This turned out good, everyone in the family liked the recipe. I precooked the dough for 10 minutes then flattened the dough in the muffin tins with a spoon before filling with the chicken filling. I recommend using canned mixed vegetables versus frozen, the frozen vegetables were too hard not soft."
1803648429,506950,2015/1/11,5,"Fast, easy and yummy! If they are not cooking correctly lower your rack, mine came out perfect."
1745502,519394,2015/1/27,5,"I have tried several versions of Peanut Soup and this one is my favorite. I used a mix of spinach and baby spring greens instead of collards, as that is what I had on hand, but it would have been even tastier with the collards or kale. I used salted natural peanut butter and the salt in the recipe and the amount of salt seemed just right. The peanuts as garnish are optional if you use chunky peanut butter. Maybe garnish with some cilantro. Anyway, easy and a great change, with lots of flavors in it."
2000097842,506950,2015/3/29,3,"I like this recipes The change that I have made is that use a larger muffin pan which cooks 6 larger size pies. I add a tablespoon of mrs. Dash seasoning they definitely need seasoning and I do not like salt.  You could also use Lawry seasoning salt I use the lower sodium version. I think mrs. Dash tastes great though.  You could use whatever seasonings you like I have also saut&eacute;ed some onion and garlic at the beginning and then added the meat and veggies before baking. I have made it using cream of chicken, celery and mushroom it all works. They take about 20-25 minutes in the larger pan I like using this size because they are not dough like and you can fit more filling so no leftovers I cook the extra 2 biscuits in the oven along side the pan hubby likes bread!!"
2000564664,506950,2016/11/23,5,"this is a delicious, easy and most importantly fast recipe!"
2000347717,506950,2017/2/27,5,"Love this recipe, it's easy and a comforting dinner. The leftovers can be easily re-heated and taste just as good."
2001362355,506950,2018/1/1,3,I didn't have the oversized muffin container so I used a metal pan. I couldn't close the jumbo biscuits so had to do a biscuit like a cup with the ingredients added to the cupped biscuit. I had to cook about 10 minutes longer than called for to get the biscuits to get cooked all the way through. I used a can of mixed vegetables instead of thawed out frozen. Good flavor.
2001894759,506950,2018/2/19,5,"I used terra cotta muffin cups, two regular muffins smooshed together, and baked them on the bottom rack as suggested. They really came out great! A little more salt, a bit more herbs and they would have been perfect. I will make them again!"
2000836495,513924,2016/1/24,5,Love this!
1004540,502609,2013/7/30,5,"Really good! Nice light salad for summer. I usually don&#039;t like kalamata olives, but chopped up really fine, you don&#039;t know they are there and gives a nice layer of flavor"
2785640,498583,2013/4/15,5,Your guacamole recipe looks wonderful. We will give it a try. My wife and I eat according to the Eat To Live plan and we have learned to make salad the main dish.
2000733931,524934,2015/12/13,5,"This was amazing, my husband and kids gobbled it up.  I loved the cheesy topping, and even added a little more since my family loves cheese."
2199258,495062,2013/2/10,5,"A tasty meal or snack, easy to prepare...Great for snacking while  watching football or other sports too!  I doubled the recipe to serve hungry buddies!"
50509,497364,2013/10/18,4,"What a wonderful twist on chicken and dumplings - not the creamy dish you are accustomed to, but one that will make your tastebuds jump! Note to myself - use a bit less salsa. I used a salsa verde that is made in the deli of my local Mexican market, and it&#039;s quite hot - we ate slowly. The dumplings are really good, and if you are making enough for two days, the masa will stay nice in the fridge for fresh dumplings the next day. One quibble - amount and type of cheese not noted in the recipe. I&#039;ve made this twice, used white cheddar once, queso fresco last night, about 1/4 cup I think. I myself would not bother with the bacon next time, it did not do much for me. I&#039;ve made this with fresh chicken thighs and also with leftover turkey, which shortened the prep time somewhat."
37449,499427,2013/5/20,5,Very nice with all the fresh herbs and citrus. I used in a sandwich and as part of a dip. Thanks!
226863,499427,2013/10/19,5,"This is a perfect match for fish!!  I enjoyed it on a grilled fish sandwich, but I imagine this would also be wonderful with chicken.  I think this would also work with grilled veggies tucked into a pita.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game."
1058097,499427,2013/12/31,5,"This is very tasty and tangy.  The tarragon gives it a lovely taste, very different.  Don&#039;t forget to add a little salt; I forgot, and my husband really noticed.  This is good on sandwiches, and I think it would also make a delicious tuna or chicken salad.  Thanks for posting!"
2002059355,536476,2018/9/28,5,"THAT was delicious, thank you! Normally I follow a recipe the first time, then write all over it to remind myself what I'd do differently next time - and I don't think I'd change a thing :-). I did cut the salt in half (blood pressure). Bonus for this recipe - I'm in the process of becoming an empty nester, and it's pretty difficult to learn to cook for two when you're used to cooking for 6. This was SO simple to reduce - I just cut up a chicken breast instead of tenders, and filled an ice cube tray with the extra coconut milk to freeze for another day. Well done!"
1803461275,536476,2018/10/30,5,"First time in my life where I purchased &quot;chicken tenders&quot;. Normally I will always sub with thigh meat. This dish was perfect as written, and the 20 minutes yielded breast meat that was moist, tender and delicious. The picture shows though, my only tweak. I had halved the recipe, but felt that I still needed the approximate 9 x 13 inch pan. Turns out I was correct. LOVED this dish."
2002248640,536476,2018/11/8,4,"This was fantastic even though I didn't have time to get to the Asian market for fish sauce. However, it definitely WILL NOT fit on a 9&times;13 pan. You'll need two half sheet size pans to make the full recipe."
128473,495723,2014/5/8,3,"This was a nice comforting meal on a cold wet rainy night.  The house smelled wonderful all day.  The meat and vegetables were nice and tender, a very subtle flavored dish. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Made for Spring Pack 2014."
2002362042,536973,2018/12/10,5,"Delicious. Thank you Jonathan. Husband and son loved the meatballs. They are not adventurous eaters so this is a good recipe to sneak in. After all, who doesn't love meatballs?"
137477,505339,2016/10/6,5,"These taste just like the way Texas Roadhouse makes them....very fluffy, tender, and slightly sweet. Perfect alone, or slathered with cinnamon-butter."
695933,500492,2013/10/7,5,A easy recipe to do ! I do have One of my tip&#039;s I do is to use a spoon or your finger and push in the middle of the ball to make an indention to place the icing in. Truely melt in your mouth. I iced with a simple powdered sugar icing flavored with vanilla and almond. I love these cookies and your icing is good too. they seem so light.

296809,504486,2013/11/7,5,"Made for your Football Pool win &amp; this is w/o doubt 1 of the best pound cakes I have ever made or tasted, so I hope you will forgive the non-recipe pers pref chgs I made on the way to my rating. What I wanted was a pound cake smaller in stature, but rich &amp; moist enough that a glaze (or frosting) would be overkill. All that said, I made 60% of the recipe based entirely on the fact that required 3 eggs &amp; I left the amts of baking powder, baking soda &amp; salt the same. To allow for the coconut flavor (which was in the glaze only), I added it to the cake batter. I set my timer for 70 min &amp; toothpick tested it until done, but forgot to note the time. I lightly dusted the surface w/powd sugar &amp; served it w/grapes &amp; fresh mint from our balcony garden. This was a HUGE hit w/us NWG! Congrats on your FP win &amp; thx for sharing this great recipe w/us. :-)"
400708,505339,2014/9/6,5,"Thrilled that I have the honor of being the first to review this awesome recipe.  I followed as directed except for one small change.  Once the rolls were shaped, took most of them and froze and then placed in sealed bag to have available.  Made enough for me and DH to have at dinner and could have had more.  They are so light and fluffy with just a slightly sweet taste and the dough is so easy and fun to work with.  Served with Honey Cinnamon Butter and are wonderful."
2000134070,520033,2015/4/13,4,"I&#039;m vegetarian and my boyfriend is a meat eater. I made this for dinner tonight and served it with peas, brown rice and garlic naan. Both me and my boyfriend thought it was really good. It is spicy though so watch the sambal or cayenne if you want to tone it down. The yogurt does help cool it off a bit though. Only complaint is that the recipie doesn&#039;t explain when to add the tomatoes. It also doesn&#039;t specify if you should drain the tomatoes either. I ended up draining them a bit and added them when I added the whole mixture together with the water before it simmered for about 45 minutes. We couldn&#039;t wait an hour the house smelled too good."
169430,503815,2013/8/17,4,"This was enjoyed a lot for this mornings breakfast. Personally, I didn&#039;t think that any sweetening was needed which is to the good for me. I&#039;m going to freeze some orange sections when I finish writing this to help make the next one a little thicker without losing flavor with more ice. Going to try putting this in my travel mug to take to work this afternoon! :D"

219942,503815,2013/8/21,4,"Very tasty and refreshing! I used vanilla yogurt, and it needed no extra sweeter. I have a smoothie nearly every morning all summer, and I&#039;ll add this one to my repertoire!  I prefer a thicker consistency, but I also like fresh squeezed juice, which is a little more watery than concentrate mixed, and to add enough ice to get the thicker smoothie would not let enough flavor shine through, so I&#039;m going to work on that. Probably add some unmixed concentrate, or orange extract. Anyway, even thin, this was a treat!  ZWT9"
67728,503815,2013/8/26,5,"This made a lovely filling breakfast smoothie! I used fresh-squeezed OJ, and one packet of Truvia (my yogurt was really tart). Delicious, easy to make, and uses things that I typically have on hand. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9"
2324285,499489,2013/6/10,4,"We enjoyed this healthy way of making tilapia.  The sauce is almost identical to the one I make for my naked chicken schnitzels, so I knew I&#039;d like it.  I quadrupled the recipe with no problems.  The only change I made was serving the tilapia over uncooked, halved grape tomatoes that were just tossed with some salt, pepper, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, as I really don&#039;t like boiled tomatoes at all. [Made &amp; Reviewed for PRMR]"
2000376685,522816,2015/8/1,5,Simple and tasty!
1086570,494336,2013/2/4,0,For Super Bowl  2013. This was the favorite wings. It left a light burn in your mouth and fantastic overall tast. This recipe was a real find. Thank you chef.
895132,506847,2014/4/29,5,"Great! I used almond milk, and it worked really well and was delicious with chicken and broccoli. I also used sweet rice flour, and dairy free, non-hydrogenated organic margarine. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
128473,492809,2013/5/21,5,"Delicious, simply Delicious Kiwi Kathy.  My dh &amp; I both enjoyed this very much.  The flavors are outstanding.  Not your standard fried rice, so yummy.  It was very very satisfying.  Bold flavors with soft tender eggs and shrimp.  We really enjoyed the Asian flavorings in the rice. The lime just puts it over the top.  Made exactly as written but used a red sweet pepper instead of yellow.  Thank you for sharing another recipe that I will make again often."

1582583,506977,2013/11/15,5,"This was great and tastes even better when you think about how healthy it is!  My kids loved the fish, just wouldn&#039;t eat the kale with it..."
482933,510204,2014/1/1,5,"What a fun recipe! Love the presentation and can see this done with other sweets--fruit, molten lava cake, brownies with pink peppermint, etc.  Easy to do, can make ahead. Can see involving kids in painting aspect. Huge recipe-yield looks right to me- I made a half batch and am going to see if I can freeze rest- realize it might separate but maybe not. Thank you Kate for posting."
352538,504146,2014/7/8,4,"This was a very good Tollhouse cookie. Tasted just like the one on the chocolate chip package with the addition of the hits of salt. A big improvement therefore on Tollhouse which I find boring. But I was disappointed the cookie wasn&#039;t better, so I will keep looking. This would be an amazing cookie for Tollhouse lovers.  Just not my cup of tea."

305531,517413,2014/9/11,5,"Great chowder. I used Dungeness crab, and re-hydrated some chanterelles and shiitakes and used part of the soaking liquid for part of the broth which added lots of flavor. This was a simple and tasty chowder. Thanks Linky for a nice winner. Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
1678694,495472,2018/7/2,5,love it! needed to replicate the McCormick's but without black pepper. yay!
2001297534,511498,2017/3/29,4,"I made this recipe as written. The 2 apples I used were Granny Smith. Instead of chopping them I peeled, cored, and then cut each apple lengthwise into 8 pieces. The recipe was easy to put together and had a lot of flavor. Leftovers freeze well. Thanks for sharing."
296809,517413,2014/11/5,5,"Made for your Football Pool win &amp; I admit I made some changes due to ingredient issues. For the seafood - I used crab meat that was mixed w/small mussels, shrimp &amp; scallops. That is strangely the only way to find crab meat here in Iceland. For the mushrooms - Every year in Aug, DH goes to the Icelandic countryside several times to pick wild mushrooms that we saut&eacute; w/chopped onion &amp; then freeze for non-seasonal use. That said, this chowder was an easy-fix &amp; made a tasty meal when served w/a green salad &amp; garlic butter baguette rolls. Thx for posting this recipe &amp; Congrats on your Football Pool win."
1269180,499016,2013/11/7,5,"Really quick and easy, and delicious - even loved by the veggie-hating men of the house! Pleasant to see a Sweet and Sour without pineapple, which I hate to eat cooked. Thanks!"
844554,494592,2013/4/10,5,Great salad! I used seasoned rice vinegar instead of white vinegar and used a whole onion. We both loved it. Made for PAC Spring 2013.

2056895,502876,2014/1/21,5,"I planted a Persian lime tree in the spring, and was delighted to get so many. I was looking for a way to use them up, I&#039;d already made two Key Lime Pies, and given a lot of limes away. I&#039;ve been living in Florida for several years now, I was happy to come across this recipe, I used to buy Rose&#039;s Lime Juice in the UK, now I&#039;m wondering if this is a UK or US website. I just picked the last 23 limes off the tree, and managed to squeeze out 3 1/2 cups of juice and ammended the ingredients accordingly, for the extra juice. I followed the recipe exactly, and used food colouring from my &#039;Williams Sonoma&#039;  &#039;Food Paste Set&#039; Vivid Color. I bought it recently for decorating cakes.  I&#039;m used to the liquid food colouring, a drop goes a long way. Because this was a paste, I used a tooth pick to take a little out and stuck it into the cordial. Even though it was such a small amount, several globs appeared, which were difficult to mix in. It helped when I strained it. I&#039;m happy with the  green colour, even though it&#039;s a bit darker than Roses. It tastes really delicious. Tomorrow I&#039;m going to make this recipe, using grapefruits from my tree, can&#039;t wait. Thank you very much for the recipe."
2000297892,502876,2015/6/27,5,I have a Tahitian lime in fruit at present and we&#039;ve been overwhelmed by the sheer volume this year. Finding this recipe was a real win! I made some this morning and it tastes great. Thanks very much for sharing the info.
2000415211,502876,2015/8/19,5,I really enjoy the occasional vodka gimlet but don&#039;t like that Roses Lime Juice contains High fructose corn syrup.  This recipe is awesome. It takes exactly like Rose&#039;s. Thank you.
2001689451,502876,2017/8/27,0,"Roses is now owned by Coca Cola, who I suspect are trying to get rid of it entirely. For several years it was off the market completely here (Ireland) and when it returned, it is only available from (of all people) Marks &amp; Spencer. Ours contains no high-fructose corn syrup (I think that's a US-specific ingredient). The label says Water, Lime Juice from concentrate (5%), Sugar, Citric Acid, Flavourings, Preservative (Sodium Metabisulphite), Colours (Carotenes, Green S). I shall make some of your recipe as soon as I get near some limes...thank you!"

169430,506632,2013/9/27,5,"Oh my goodness, Autumn perfection in a cup. The cinnamon and pumpkin spice are a wonderful match and put you into a mind to start carving a jack o&#039;lantern. I made a single cup (hot) this morning and after the simmer ran the mix through a coffee filter to strain out the loose spice which didn&#039;t look so pretty and had already given up it&#039;s best flavor. The cinnamon stick continued on into my cup of tea that I lightly sweetened with Splenda. A small amount of fat free coffee creamer, 1/2 a teaspoonish, was added. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable cuppa. :D"
804550,506632,2013/10/1,5,"Wonderful beverage. I made this both ways, cold and hot. Depending on the temperature of the day reflected on whether I enjoyed hot or cold. I think I prefer the hot version more. I used milk as I was out of almond. Made for veg &#039;n Swap tag #62."

461834,502947,2014/2/5,5,"Loved the method for poaching the eggs.  By swirling the water, when the egg enters, it keeps it moving, and not letting it sit on the bottom of the pan.  My only problem was that at 3 minutes, my whites were not firm (still watery) so I cooked another egg for a longer period of time with great results!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for the &quot;Best of 2013 Tag Game.&quot;"
542159,502947,2014/2/8,5,"Have been using vinegar for years but this is the first time I recall spinning the water before adding the egg and it worked out perfectly. The yoke was nice and run, just the way we like it. Thanks for the post."
498271,502947,2014/3/7,5,"This is the way to make a perfect poached egg!  I scaled this back for 1 egg; I don&#039;t like the white to be runny so cooked about 3 1/2 minutes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for the Best of 2013 event, recommended by I&#039;mPat"
2000498330,500942,2016/10/23,4,"The filling is a good base recipe. Needed additional spices for my taste--chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper. Good filling lunch on the fly."
2000451677,514226,2015/9/3,5,Made this today and it tastes amazing. Will definitely make it again. Tempted to try it with chorizo instead of bacon.
2000478993,514226,2015/9/16,5,Tasty and healthy side! Made it with turkey rashers and olive oil instead of butter and its a winner. Thanks x

2002168357,535723,2018/5/30,5,This was beyond amazing!!
228458,503160,2013/8/23,4,"Let me start by saying that my kids absolutely loved these! Except for the almond, but I was more than happy to eat those LOL. I used white wheat flour here with no problems. I loved how the cardamom adds that little extra &quot;something&quot;. Thanks so much for posting! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
1745502,503160,2013/8/23,4,"Rich cute cookies. I could have used a bit more help in deciding how big a &quot;bit&quot; of dough was and how thin the thin ropes should be. The white color is kind of nice actually. I liked the almond. If you like shortbread, this recipe will make a nice variation for you."
80353,503833,2013/7/16,4,"These little balls of cheesy goodness were delicious spread on pita crisps.  I&#039;d hesitate to serve them with fresh fruit, though, because of the garlic add-in, but that may just be personal preference."

219942,505595,2013/8/12,5,"While I was waiting for these to bake I was thinking about what to frost them with, but there is no need! Wow, these little cupcakes have a LOT of flavor and such a wonderful texture. Just delicious. I think I&#039;ll make some mini loaves/bundts to put in my holiday baskets this year. Great recipe!

169430,505595,2013/8/13,5,"Mmmmmmm, chocolate muffins. As I found myself awake late night and not likely to go back to sleep anytime real soon I baked. This recipe makes beautiful rich chocolate muffins that could easily double as cupcakes. I subbed Splenda for the sugar but aside from that I made as directed. They have a great texture and if you have one still warm the melty chocolate is just plain heaven. Thanks momaphet for a keeper recipe."
126440,505595,2013/8/16,5,Loved the flavor and texture.  Will make these all the time.  Used almonds for the nuts and got 16 wonderful muffins.
1334806,505595,2013/9/4,5,"Wow - so chocolatey and delicious!  I used Valhrona dark chocolate and semisweet chips, plus instant espresso and dry roasted almond slivers.  Perfect muffins - a keeper!  made for ZWT9."

2002199434,530879,2018/6/26,0,Love this cocktail. It is the forerunner of the Cosmo
2002169234,530879,2018/8/19,5,"Actually, not to be a nitpicker, but I think the character's name was Roman Castevet; I remember because Rosemary had to make an anagram of the name Stephen Marcado and that's what she came up with. But it's easy to get confused, because the movie also starred John Casavettes, and that surname is pretty similar. These vodka blush's are delicious by the way, but since they're pretty much straight booze, consider their high octane aspect and serve with appetizers."
537937,505595,2014/1/12,5,"Moist and delcious chocolately goodness.  Note to future bakers.  It&#039;ll look like you have too much batter for 12 muffin cups, but fill cups completely full.  These muffins do not raise much.  &lt;br/&gt;Love the addition of chocolate chips to the batter.  Yum, Yum!!!"
461834,505595,2014/8/21,5,"OMG!!  Just loved these muffins!!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe, but didn&#039;t have the amount listed for the toasted almonds, but used what I had on hand and definitely toasted them.  I used 1/2 of the vanilla and 1/2 of the Kahlua amounts in the recipe.  I took them out and let them cool for a bit while taking photos, then added a smear of butter and these were just so wonderful, beyond what I expected.  The almonds were a huge factor in how much I enjoyed these muffins.  I made 1/2 of the recipe, which resulted in 7 muffins and I froze five of them and still have one for tomorrow morning, so good!!  I know I will be making these for guests or special occasions in the future, but, making sure I have plenty of slivered almonds.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, made for CQ 2014."
157425,505595,2014/8/29,5,"These muffins are amazing! Anyone who enjoys chocolate needs to make these muffins. I used unsalted butter, vanilla extract and the toasted almonds.

323186,514210,2014/10/27,5,"Made as per recipe and thoroughly enjoyed : I love everything in the recipe so really couldnt go wrong!!!    Blue cheese, bacon and pinenuts - YUM!   I did like the concept of baking it, gave all the flavours time to mingle, and I was also glad there were no mushrooms, since there often are in this kind of dish and I dont really like them.  In short, very good, thank you breezermom, made for Consideration Tag game, FFF (I had forgotten to add the pinenuts when I took my photo, but I assure you I used them and they work very well in this recipe!!!)"
107135,503553,2013/8/25,5,"this has alot of flavors  ,i love how well it goes with catfish , i kinda eyeballed the ginger so i didnt get overwhelmed .try this if you like catfish zwt9"
2001581497,503553,2017/6/12,5,"Wow! This is really good and flavorful. I was a bit worried about the salt, but my husband loved it. The fish, stand alone, was wonderful. For future meals, I will look for low sodium sauces. But all the ginger was GREAT!. Quite a nice kick to it. Thanks!"
266635,507297,2013/11/5,5,"I&#039;m a big fan of Caesar dressing and this creamy version was really great.  The ingredients were really flavorful - didn&#039;t change anything except that used my favorite garlic croutons.  I used anchovy paste vs. anchovies which is absolutely necessary in a good Caesar dressing.  Will definitely make this again! Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
171084,499604,2013/5/8,5,I too saw this floating about on FaceBook &amp; Pinterest and could not wait to try.  This is easy to prepare and so very good.  I have now made this a couple of times and have to say TRY THIS!!  I doubled the cheese filling and used it to make Jalapeno Poppers both on the grill and in the oven.  This is on a regular rotation in our house now.  Thanks for posting on this site!
2897778,499604,2013/7/11,5,Awesome recipe! Had it on family vacation and the chicken was gone in no time...
2936000,499604,2013/8/8,5,"Great recipie.  Used thin cut bacon and smoked the chicken bombs using apple wood at around 300 degrees.  Brushed it with a spicy peach BBQ sauce.  Next time I run this, I&#039;m going to fire-roast the jalapenos first and season the cream cheese mixture."
46082756,499604,2014/1/22,4,"Great flavors all around, I would recommend roasting the jalape"
1369395,499604,2014/1/24,5,"Delicious!!!! Everyone loved it!!! Very similar to the one I saw on Facbook, but I used 3 chicken breasts (which made 6 after cutting in half and pounding thin)  6 oz. cream cheese, 1 Cup shredded colby jack cheese, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp Tony&#039;s creole seasoning, mild jalapeno slices from a jar and 1 slice of bacon per piece of chicken. Some of the cheese oozed out but was soooo yummy!! My food snob fiance, woke up the next morning and said, &quot;That chicken last night was awesome&quot;!!"
1802849525,499604,2014/6/23,0,"i just figured out what step 2 is telling me to do. i didn&#039;t read the ingredient list properly, so i didn&#039;t know that you had to cut the jalapeno&#039;s in half&#039;s before reading the method."
1803633563,499604,2015/1/8,3,"Definitely has potential. Sadly, this recipe was a bit bland for me. The BBQ sauce was the only real flavor that stood out...everything else just blended together. Next time, I would definitely roast the jalape"
2000069312,499604,2015/6/17,0,I just made this awesome kick butt chicken! And I paired it with a southwestern salad and a ice cold corona yum
636915,502215,2013/7/13,5,I have made this a few times before and it always gets rave reviews! It is amazing that something so easy to put together tastes that good!
174096,492965,2013/11/17,5,Very nice - so simple and easy.  I used pepperjack cheese and both tomatoes and kiwi.  This came together quickly.  Made in honor of pammyowl.
296809,504603,2013/9/14,4,"Made for your Wk 1 Football Pool win &amp; I made an error w/your recipe. Made &amp; tasted late yesterday, I decided a pic could wait til today. When DH&#039;s brother joined us for brunch late this morning &amp; we devoured the remains, it was too late for a pic. So I will comment B4 I make it again for us to enjoy &amp; for your pic. The prep was a rocky road. Made as written using my homemade jam, the dough was too moist to crumble over the surface &amp; had to be spread there. It was baked in a 9-in pie plate, but overflowed the pie plate &amp; had to be cooked an extra 10 min B4 removal from the oven. It was jiggling at that point, but brown &amp; crusty on the surface. That said, this is very sweet &amp; these are chgs I will make for its encore: 1) Use a larger baking dish, 2) Reduce the butter to &frac34; cup, 3) Reduce both sugars to 1/3 cup ea, 4) Reduce the rhubarb jam to &frac12; cup &amp; 5) Use half the dough on the bottom &amp; half on the surface. That is a lot of chg, I know, but this recipe is a very worthy keeper w/these chgs IMHO. Thx for sharing this taste sensation &amp; IOU a pic for your recipe. :-)"
350921,496088,2013/7/25,5,Very good even without the olives.  Will definitely make again.
1951388,496088,2013/9/18,0,My husband has been on the Paleo diet for about 3 weeks and he really misses his Mexican food.  These were perfect.  They had all of the right Mexican favors and they make great leftovers.  Yum!
2698444,496088,2014/4/29,4,"My younger son hates everything, but he ate two of these!  I put cheddar on the kids&#039; peppers and avocado on the adults&#039;.  Great recipe!"
1802849713,496088,2014/8/4,5,Always looking for paleo recipes that actually taste good! These were excellent! I used &quot;no salt added&quot; tomatoes and olives and plain avocado and it was still delicious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will be making this regularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks so much for sharing!
285039,496088,2015/1/14,5,"Fantastic recipe!  I used ground beef and a small amount of chorizo, rotel tomatoes, and eliminated the olives.  I also topped this with my standard guacamole recipe instead of the mixture in the recipe.  I will definitely make this again!"
42214306,496088,2018/8/13,4,"I made this last night. It was good, but not great. I just think it needs to be tweaked with the seasoning a little bit. I may just try a spicier taco seasoning or a homemade one. Straightforward to put together and adding guacamole on top is a nice finish. Just needs a little bit more bite. The family liked it and I will definitely make again."
695933,508927,2013/11/13,5,"I keep the dressing outside the turkey, and so compensate with extra broth. Make sure to spray your pan and keep it covered with foil! I?ve found that stirring it after it?s baked for 30 minutes or so, helps it bake more evenly. The only other changes I make are to throw in a little chardonnay for flavor and to add an egg for a little extra hold. I&#039;ve also found that sage pork sausage is much more flavorful (make sure to drain it after cooking however). I have a habit of not measuring, so more cranberries and herbs always find their way in. And I cannot emphasize the difference FRESH herbs make. Experiment with different kinds of bread as well! Sourdough and potato bread have yielded delicious results. I&#039;ve had a few flavor variations, but every result was just as tasty as the last. This is one of my favorite recipe from this site at this time.....Thank you Rosie!!! For getting me  Inspired to play with my food !!  Happy Cooking to y&#039;all!......PRMR 2013....Grpa  I can do the happy food dance Now!"
266635,508927,2013/11/28,5,"This dressing was a very nice change of pace for us.  Forgive me though because I Texanized it a bit.  I used both cornbread and herb stuffing mix (no cubes for us as I think of that as stuffing not dressing), I increased the chicken stock and added an additional egg.  I also used green onions vs. regular and regular sausage vs. sage.  DH enjoyed it and so did I -- it went great with our other veggies that utilized dried cranberries as well.  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
163112,508927,2014/9/8,5,"Noticing this in the list of approved recipes in Culinary Quest 2014 started a mad craving!  I use bulk Italian sweet sausage instead of Jimmy Dean so I added a fistful of fresh sage leaves (minced) from the garden.  I wish I had added more but I kept hearing my mom saying, &quot;be careful with sage, it can get overpowering fast.&quot;  I could have used more. ;)  I baked this in a 9x13 pan, uncovered, for more surface area/crust.  YUM!  Turns out 1dd doesn&#039;t like stuffing/dressing but the other dd &amp; I ate HALF of it for dinner.  It *is* a complete meal!  Made for CQ2014/CCQ."

447487,505751,2013/8/27,4,"Definitely an interesting change to everyday hummus. Dh wasn&#039;t as sure about it as myself but I think that was partially my fault as I used a cheap food processor so the texture was rather grainy. I really enjoyed the combination of spices though I may try with raw onion and no yoghurt next time to give it a bit more zing. Thanks for posting another great recipe, Nif! &lt;br/&gt;Made for Team Tasty Tester&#039;s during ZWT #9 :)"
386585,504683,2013/10/21,4,"I grew up eating escarole and beans, so I was pleased to find this recipe when I was looking for a different way to prepare some curly kale I got from the farm.  The leeks were a nice change of pace and added a lot of flavor.  However, I was not planning on serving this over pasta, but eating  it on its own, and did not have any pasta water to add.  Instead, I added a little bit of warm chicken broth, which worked out well.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for My 3 Chefs - October 2013."
2001917895,513476,2018/1/7,5,Excellent recipe. loaded all the ingredients from the bottom of the list and moved upwards - great first time.
41591562,518247,2015/8/18,5,Very delicious! I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it!
2000666962,520030,2015/11/11,5,I remember my mother making and telling me about her mother making salmon patties with white sauce. So l was excited to see this recipe and had to try it. I also made cream of mushroom soup too. Wow this was on the money. Off the charts. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you so much for the recipe. Absolutely delishes!
1415433,516662,2015/11/17,5,"I made one almost the same today and was great, instead of posting going to review what I did. Baked at 350, used a 14 oz can of beans as couldn&#039;t find 15 oz. (for the 3 eggs i mixed them separately and poured out a little) used 6tbs of butter and a little less than 3/4 cup of sugar. steps, mix cocoa, baking p and soda in small bowl. In larger bowl, beat the butter or coconut oil until light and fluffy, add 2 eggs one at a time. (beat well after each egg). in a blender add the beans, 3 pre mixed eggs (a little poured out as less beans), vanilla, sugar and salt. mix until smooth. Add to butter mix to combine. Stir in the remaining dry ingredients and 1tbs h20 and beat on high for 1 minute. bake for 30-35 mins (might need longer) made with kittencals chocolate frosting (89207)and decorated with raspberries"
2001602188,516662,2017/6/27,5,"I was having awful chocolate cravings that I needed to satisfy but wanted to stay relatively healthy while doing so. This is my favorite black bean chocolate cake recipe I've found on the internet so far. The only thing I did differently was add 2 Stevia packets. So delicious! You would be amazed that this is not actually your typical chocolate cake. I had some friends over shortly after I made it and didn't tell them after that it was made from black beans, until after they told me the cake was really good! Now just on the search for a healthy/low calorie frosting to go along with it."
2001650558,516662,2017/7/30,0,"Before using this recipe I had actually decided that I'd follow another recipe found online. Somehow I mixed up the two recipes &amp; in error baked this gluten free chocolate cake for my sons birthday. I am so grateful that I made this mistake. The recipe is awesome, simple and more importantly my son &amp; family LOVED it. The cake is moist, has a wonderful texture &amp; tastes rich without being overly sweet. Next time I'll play with the eggs a bit, perhaps use a flax egg to replace a couple of the eggs but this cake is wonderful just the way it it (I like to play with recipes so will try variations out of curiousity). Bottom line - this will be my go to chocolate cake from now on. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Best mistake I ever made. :) 5 stars"
2001709297,516662,2017/9/10,0,why do u have to wait 8 hrs?
37449,501368,2014/4/30,4,"I like the topping for the eggplant! I had to roast a little longer but it turned out nice. Thanks! Made for Pick a Chef event, spring 2014."
2000524526,516662,2018/2/24,5,"I've made this recipe twice now. What a hit!! I have a co-worker that is gluten intolerant and this was a dream for her :-) The photos I added was my second time around. Pillsbury makes a gluten free frosting, Wal-Mart carries it, but you must order it. Due to the size of the cake I had to use 3 canisters, LOL! My teenage sons did not mind! Thank yhou for sharing! PS: The waiting is because of the beans, though you cannot taste them a day afterward, you can kind of taste them within a few hours of baking."
2000381308,516662,2018/3/22,5,"I have made this a few times and always turns out terrific. The last time I added the zest of two oranges and wow, it really made it pop. Has become a big favourite. Thanks for the recipe."
2002371843,516662,2018/12/19,5,This cake is incredible tasting and easy to make. Frosted with 7 minute icing. Perfect for those who are gluten intolerant. Will definitely make again.

2597942,495364,2013/4/4,5,"This recipe is a great way to use up your holiday ham! I used all the same ingredients listed, I guessed at the amounts, also and I diced the ham strips. But I kind of made little potato panckes (about 3&quot; diameter) with the mixture, frying 3 at a time, and keeping a platter in the oven (on warm) for the cooked ones, while frying the rest. I served these with only applesauce as a side dish to them... and it was fantastic!. Family LOVED them. I still have some ham left that I froze, and I will definately be making these again! Thank you for coming up with a fabulous recipe. We truly enjoyed it. (Made for PRMR - Spring 2013)"
1269180,495364,2014/2/11,3,"Frustrating recipe - the Rosti kept falling apart in the pan, needed something to &quot;bind&quot; them more I think. Flavours great, but this was more hash than Rosti!"
2000177785,504628,2015/7/19,5,"This recipe was easy to follow and made an excellent cake. I have a soft spot for apple crumble and was looking around for something different to do with my sourdough (discard) starter. I am so glad I found this recipe. At first I thought it used a lot of honey, but it turned out to not be too sweet at all (at least for me). I used chopped almonds and walnuts instead of pecan nuts and substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil. Really tasty dessert and one I will be making more often. Thank you!"
2001308022,504628,2016/12/20,5,"Yummy! I substituted for the 2/3 cup honey, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup maple syrup. You do not need to peel the apples. Added 1tsp vanilla to wet ingredients. My spice mix was 1 tsp cinnamon and pinch each of ground cloves, allspice and nutmeg. Did not put nuts in topping, and still delicious!"
227978,503443,2013/8/17,5,"What a great recipe, lazyme.  The lemon adds a zesty touch to the rice without being overwhelming.  I really like Jasmine rice, and this is a great way of preparing it.  Made for ZWT #9 (SE Asia-Thailand)."
542159,503443,2013/8/24,5,Great technique for making rice and the lemon just pushes it right over the top. I served with chicken but agree with you it would be a fantastic side for salmon or shrimp. Thanks for the post.
329769,503443,2013/8/24,5,Reviewed for ZWT9- a truly delicious and simple way to prepare rice. Lovely delicate lemon flavour that makes a lovely side to almost any Vietnamese dish.
2608692,498225,2013/6/30,5,"I hate macaroni salad.  The only kind I will ever eat and enjoy, is at L &amp; L.  I searched for this recipe for a Luau I have coming up, and to me it&#039;s spot on with L &amp; L.  It&#039;s really simple, and hard to stop eating.  Love it, and so did all of my test tasters.  I will try it with the tuna though, just to compare."
1800055520,498225,2013/9/11,5,This is it! This tastes exactly like L
2001897486,531254,2018/4/25,0,How much of each ingredient do you use?
2002100961,531254,2018/4/25,0,Well if I will read the entire recipe I can answer my own question!
2002267681,531254,2018/9/6,0,What can you use besides bananas?
1800226942,498225,2013/11/10,4,"This is very close to the L&amp;L salad. I&#039;d recommend cutting it in half unless you&#039;re making this for a party. Even starting with 1/2 lb of dry macaroni, there&#039;s enough for 6-8 servings. (Remember, the traditional Hawaiian plate lunch calls for 1 scoop of macaroni and 2 scoops of rice!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want a medium shred on the carrot. Too fine and it gets wet and turns everything orange. Too course and it&#039;s overly crunchy and distracting.  Also, it&#039;s closer to the restaurant version with about half the amount of carrot than the recipe indicates, about 1/4 cup per 1 cup of dry macaroni. The amount of onion is also too much and cutting it in half is better. Sweet onion is best if you can get it, otherwise yellow will do.  Shredding the onion isn&#039;t necessary, but it needs to be prepared even finer than minced so that it&#039;s almost a paste.  It doesn&#039;t need to be rinsed or dried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I STRONGLY disagree with the comment that says tuna is in the restaurant salad. Maybe the original recipe published by Eddie Flores, Jr. had it, but I&#039;ve also never seen it in the salad from any L&amp;L.  Even if I&#039;m wrong and the restaurant version still has tuna, it&#039;s undetectable and certainly not 1 small can per 1 lb of dry macaroni, which means it can be left out entirely.  Prepare it both ways and you&#039;ll see the version without tuna is more like the restaurant than the one with tuna."
1802906890,498225,2014/7/8,0,Yummy! I made this for friends from Hawaii and they loved it! Thanks for sharing this authentic recipe!
1486329,498225,2014/7/27,4,I reduced the salt to half. I grated the white onion and rinsed it in a mesh sieve. I then pressed out the water. No crunchy over powering onion taste. Perfect!
1803021553,498225,2014/8/11,4,Should have read the review before cooking.&lt;br/&gt;Please reduce the salt to 1/2.&lt;br/&gt;It was too salty.
2000342059,498225,2015/7/16,5,This recipe is AWESOME!! My husband is Tongan and I have been looking for a good Mac Salad recipe to satisfy the family. This one does the trick! My one year old is teething and this is the only thing he wants to eat. I used a veggie peeler for the onion and carrot then chopped them both up with my chefs knife. The amount of mayo this recipe calls for is kind of a lot so I ended up making more pasta but other than that it&#039;s amazing. Thank you!
2000377605,498225,2015/8/1,5,"I am making this today. Just called my L&amp;L on Willow in Long Beach, CA and they confirmed that they in fact DO put tuna in their salad. They said that not all of the L&amp;L&#039;s do and they only put a little in so I am adding 1/4 can to a half a recipe as I think it&#039;s the best. I have already made the Kalua pork. Dinner isgonna be good tonight"
2001046333,498225,2016/6/11,5,"According to the instructions on the macaroni I used, I had to salt the water with about a 1/4 cup of salt (for 1lb). Because of this, I decided not to use any salt at all, and it tastes just fine. I agree with others that if you half the amount of carrots (my small grater size on my Ikea box grater seemed to make the right size shreds of carrot) and sweet onion, it seems perfect. I also used slightly less white pepper (3/4 tsp). I don't know if it's just the L&amp;L's in LA, but the ones I go to also put a tiny bit of tuna in their mac salad too. It's delicious without the tuna, but hubby thinks the texture might be better and more like the Mac salad from the Torrance L&amp;L if we add a bit of tuna. We're going to try it on half the salad and will report back."
2001047963,498225,2016/7/4,5,It's great as the recipe states. There is a lot of mayo but it dries up a bit in the fridge if you are chilling it before you serve it. I do add some milk right before serving. I also do rinse the onions. It helps.
2001107767,498225,2016/7/30,3,Recipe calls for way to much salt. Was extremely salty!!
2001266703,498225,2016/11/24,3,"I worked at an L&amp;L back in 2004-05. I am sure things have changed since then. The onion is minced in a food processor. It is then placed in a cloth, and twisted to remove any juice. There is garlic powder in it as well. I add it to taste. But for 1lb of macaroni uncooked, I would say to add about 1 1/2 tsp. The carrot is not shredded. It was through a food processor also. There was also MSG in it. I only add a pinch. Chilling overnight always makes it taste better!"
2001525928,498225,2017/5/7,4,"Real recipe at Hawaiian drive ins, boil mac in hot water with chicken bouillon; when cooked well done drain and don't rinse; let cool to room temperature, add mayo, blanched fine shredded carrots, onion powder, salt and pepper to taste. That's all it is. Just go easy on da onion powder and salt."
2001644215,498225,2017/7/26,0,"I go to the L &amp; L on Imperial at LAX.. I also, love the macaroni salad. I was told by the cashier that they do add tuna. Not sure how the tuna can be so pink like shrimp though. Could it actually be diced up shrimp?"
386585,507205,2013/10/21,4,"This was an interesting way to prepare eggs Benedict, that got varied reviews from my guests, but averaged out to 4 stars.  The sauce is very rich and quite different from the typical hollandaise sauce usually used.  While it tasted good, I did not care for the color, which was a tan shade.  Regarding the poaching of the eggs, I suggest that you undercook them, since they are later baked and could end up overcooked.  I made them in varying degrees of doneness  to accommodate the different tastes of my guests.  I&#039;m not sure why this has to sit overnight, though.  The muffins ended up a little soggy on the bottom, probably from sitting in the sauce overnight.  I think next time, I would forgo the corn flake topping.  The texture was not really popular with anyone.   However, I like the idea of the recipe, and will tweak it to my tastes next time.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."

I did use Recipe #512333 for the black beans, however I added all of the ingredients listed under the Add When Reheating heading (except subbing red wine vinegar for balsamic vinegar). So when I made the soup I did not add additional sherry which I think was a good decision. I used dry sherry as that was what I had on hand. Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014."

I don't like a communal bowl &amp; couldn't imagine having it as a soup, so I served on jacket potatoes with salad (&amp; soft tortilla pieces).

226867,503984,2018/8/24,5,I used a not quite day old baguette and followed the doctor's orders and voila! Croutons! Wow - couldn't be easier! Made for SWT2018
1256549,494430,2013/2/4,5,"Great!  I must admit this was a last minute decision so I had to use what I had on hand.  I didn't have leeks, so I increased the amount of chopped onion to 1-1/2.  I also didn't have a fresh head of cabbage, so I used a half bag of cole slaw I had left over in the fridge. (The shredded carrots added a nice bit of color to the soup!)  At the end I used a hand-held stick blender to smooth up about half of it.  The flavor was very nice.  Not bland or overpowering: just right!  An easy, and delicious recipe."
1490742,494430,2014/3/6,3,"This was an ok soup.  I added some artisan sausage to kick it up a bit.  For anyone making this,  just as a note as the recipe doesn&#039;t say it, you should be stripping the thyme leaves (probably obvious to some, not to rookies) and add the parsley at the same time (no mention of when to add that on the recipe).  I added extra garlic and potatoes.  The directions call for 4 cups of broth, but I found that to be too little.  I had 3 average size leeks, and maybe the cabbage heads are bigger here in Arkansas :)   Just add enough to make it a soup and not a sludge.  Not a bad choice for a cold winter night."
1802849661,494430,2015/2/13,4,"My leeks were HUGE, so I only used two, but this worked out fine with the rest of the ingredients. I adore potato and leek soup and the addition of cabbage made a nice change. This was hearty and comforting."
2001827705,494430,2017/11/27,5,Can out very good. I had to add more broth to make it more like soup. I added a carrot as well to add some colour
2002096678,494430,2018/4/5,5,"Delicious soup. I added rosemary because I didn't have thyme, a little cumin and cayenne pepper to knock off the cold I'm trying to kill! I also added extra garlic and white beans, spinach and parmesan at the end for added texture, colour and flavour. SO GOOD!"
1745502,505385,2014/8/14,5,"Well yum. The fritters are great, but the sauce is killer delicious. The combo is just right.  I am thinking up great ways to use the leftover sauce. (If I only wanted enough sauce for this recipe, I would half it.) I like keeping it warm in the oven for 10 minutes. That makes sure there are no uncooked spots.I was afraid it would be too eggy for DH, but it wasn&#039;t."
314579,505385,2014/9/23,5,This was yummy!!  The sauce and the egg made these even better!  Thanks Sofie!!  Made for Culinary Quest FP 2014!
128473,505385,2015/8/18,5,"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe Sofie.  I really enjoyed these delicious zucchini fritters.  I love zucchini fritters and this recipe does not disappoint.  It was quick and easy to make with great results.  The fritters were perfect, moist, tender and delicious.  I&#039;ll be enjoying these again.  The sauce was the bomb.  So good, it made the delicious fritters even better.  Made for Culinary Quest - Quebec - 2015."
131126,505385,2016/8/23,5,I liked the flavor added by the fresh ginger and the sauce was terrific. I did have problems with consistency of the zucchini mixture. It was extremely sticky and hard to flatten into patties without falling apart. After the first two I added a tad more flour and that seemed to help. (I had sweated and squeezed the zucchini dry.) i found the detailed instructions helpful as well. I will definitely use the seasonings from this recipe again and make the sauce. Thank you for sharing your recipe! Made for Culinary Quest 2016.
39835,493179,2013/1/20,4,Easy and good! Thanks for sharing!
2002001857,534877,2018/2/20,0,"Amazing!!! Delicious said hubby. I did however do a little tweaking. Instead of salt and pepper I used Montreal chicken seasoning for chops, didn't have grapeseed oil so cut up 3pieces of bacon while waiting for saute reach hot. Otherwise followed recipe,best and easiest recipe so far in my minipot I got for Christmas."
798292,534877,2018/10/29,5,"This was great, I peeled my potatoes, cut them a bit smaller before placing them in the steamer basket, and mashed them at the end, the gravy was great on them too!"
37449,502613,2013/8/1,5,"I loved the sweet and the tart mix of flavors! I used a medium cheddara cheese, but the sharp would have been even better. Thanks! Made for Please Review My Recipe(PRMR) game."
542159,502613,2014/4/13,5,"Adored the savory twist on the tasty apple salad, I did make two very minor changes the first was to use Colby cheese instead of Cheddar as that is what I had on hand and the other was to cut the mayo in half (trying to cut the fat just a little). We both thought we would like to try this with lime juice in place of the rice vinegar. Thanks for the post."
593927,509287,2013/12/31,4,"Pretty good but quite minty! My kids drank it up! I had raw cocao nibs I wanted to try in something so I found this. I didn&#039;t have nut milk which wouldn&#039;t be raw I doubt if store bought. I used water and the last of a good organic tahini in its place, an organic fair trade banana not Dole, my extracts are alcohol free but not raw. I may make this again for my kids because it&#039;s pretty healthy."
128473,500523,2013/6/4,5,"Thank you for sharing your lovely recipe.  I enjoyed these waffles very much.  I garnished them with icing sugar, butter and a little heated maple syrup. They were big, fluffy and tender. Quick and easy to make.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Made for New Kids on the Block."
1620171,499504,2013/6/1,4,"We&#039;re a bit mixed in our review for this one. The end result was quite dense (but tasty). We weren&#039;t sure if it was correct for it to be so thick, if this was a result of our dough not rising properly or what the recipe was meant to look like. We ended up making a thin one and 3 thick ones, after halving the recipe (half recipe made 4 breads, serving sizes). I topped with all three seeds as I had them on hand and those flavours were lovely. Made for My Food Odyssey, Afghanistan."
2045931,519068,2017/8/2,5,"It really does make popcorn taste like Doritos! Since my daughter and I both have corn chip allergies and are not able to eat Doritos anymore, we can now get a similar taste with this recipe. Very easy to mix up - I just stirred together all of the ingredients and then ground them a bit finer with my mortar and pestle. I sprinkled a light coating over hot buttered popcorn - delicious! The only thing I did differently was to leave out the cayenne pepper - the chili powder made it spicy enough for my daughter. This recipe is a keeper."
1072593,519068,2017/8/9,5,Lured me into eating too much popcorn. Snake charming to a new level.
2001923768,519068,2018/1/18,0,how do u make this
2549237,493252,2013/5/6,5,"This gets a 5 star rating because all 3 of my kids asked when I was making it again and if I could make it for lunch tomorrow.  The apples and beans were really good, even my husband who doesn&#039;t like baked beans/pork &#039;n beans liked them.  The meat was a little dry and bland. I would really spice them up next time.  Thank you Nancy!  Made for Please Review My Recipe Spring 2013."
2067838,493252,2013/7/3,3,"I really liked it, However Next time I would heat up the baked beans first &amp; drain the liquid.&lt;br/&gt;It was very soupy.&lt;br/&gt;I added a bit a nutmeg &amp; omitted the sugar."
2001346663,493252,2017/1/11,5,Made as a last minute throw together. Had my two teens help make it and everyone loves it. Made changes: Did two cans of Pork &amp; Beans ; 3 Apples ; Didn't cover it at all ; Season Salt on the chops as we browned them ; Turned out great!!!
679953,497628,2013/9/29,4,"These were good, small calories, and flavorful.  I did use canned corn, and left out the salt.  The black beans were just okay, to us, but still had .  I would probably use them again, but use about third of the black beans."
2000718562,529739,2017/1/19,4,"I couldn't get the sauce to thicken up, using half and half. Used shredded Parmesan cheese. It was very thin and watery. But that won't keep me from trying this again. We liked it overall."
2000944409,536475,2018/10/28,0,"Being on Atkins, I would use diced cauliflower instead of potatoes. Sounds delish and will make tomorrow. Or maybe tonight for dinner."
2701757,495700,2013/2/21,5,These were easy to make and tasted great. A great idea for using leftover mashed potatoes. Next time I'm going to use pepper bacon to add a little spice.
1052873,498777,2013/10/15,4,"This was pretty good, but I would use brown sugar instead of molasses. Also walnuts would probably be better than the almonds I used. Made for My 3 Chefs 2013."
227978,498777,2014/5/2,5,"I really loved this, Pandayku.  I&#039;ll make it often.  The molasses adds a wonderful boost of flavor and sweetness.  I actually made it twice now.  The first time I made it just as written, and I had no left-overs (and didn&#039;t get a chance to snap a photo).  I really craved it for breakfast again this morning,  but I had no apples on hand.   But I did manage to get a photo (which the photo I posted shows it without apples), and it was just as good as when I included everything in the ingredient list.  Made for the Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef event."
482376,505747,2013/8/24,5,"First of all, this rice is gorgeous. It is also jam packed with flavor and textures. It does take a while to do all of the steps. I toasted the pistachios and almonds in the morning to get a little head start for dinner. I halved the recipe and it was just enough for four people. Great flavor and worth the effort. Made for the Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9"
560491,492789,2013/1/9,5,"Made this with dill because I didn't have taggagon.  I also doubled the amount of broth to make a little more sauce; iti didn't make a sauce, but it made it a little more coated.  I boiled the broccoli in a separate pot since I am the only one who eats it.  Topped with sliced green onions and it was a light and healthy meal.  Made for Football Pool 2012-13 Win."
724631,492789,2013/5/15,5,"This goes into my A1 Rotation cookbook: it was tasty and easy, different from my usual choices.  Thanks for revising the recipe to call for 1&quot; chunks of chicken (my photo shows 2&quot; cubes). My local store did not have fresh tarragon or dill, so I used 1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon, and the dish was delicious. For us, I doubled the amount of broccoli, and the 2 of us devoured the rest of the ingredients with no difficulty, and had dessert.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
323186,492789,2013/11/13,5,"Can&#039;t go wrong with this, simple and delicious!  I used dried dill very successfully, and I used penne, mostly becuase I like it :)  and thought it would go well with this dish, which it did.   Lovely recipe, very much enjoyed, made in loving memory of our dear Pammyowl, never forgotten."
895132,492789,2013/11/13,5,"Lovely weeknight dinner! I used gluten free penne because thats what I had gluten free, but otherwise made as written. Like Karen Elizabeth said, can&#039;t go wrong with this. Thanks for another yummy recipe, dear Pam!&lt;br/&gt;Made for the Cookathon in memory of pammyowl, November 2013"
1745502,503551,2013/8/23,4,"This was pretty. The tomatoes made the taste a little different. I think that I would use unfried tofu next time, as the effort to fry it (I&#039;m not so good at deep-fat-frying) is not worth the taste change. Well I guess I like unfried tofu better."
169430,507256,2013/9/30,4,"This looks incredible and it made a hearty soup dinner. It&#039;s thick, tasty and quite filling. Great with hot biscuits on the side."
1706426,507256,2013/10/5,5,"So quick and simple, a perfect cold weather meal! Thanks for sharing, made for my three chefs, 2013"
165623,507256,2013/12/30,4,"I think this is a good base for any creamy soup. I made as is and it was just ok. I added seasoning salt and white pepper. When I was slicing the sheepherder bread to serve with dinner,  I thought oh what about the garlic dip. I added a dollop of that and magically it became just enough flavor. It is a very filling and easy soup - I will however try it with hot sausage next time or add some Cajun seasoning."
128473,496534,2014/5/2,5,"Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.  I really enjoyed it.  The french toast puffed up beautifully, but fell when I took out of pan.  I used frozen organic blueberries in this... so good.  The french toast was so quick and easy to make and had a really lovely flavor.  I really enjoyed the addition of the brown sugar topping. Didn&#039;t miss maple syrup at all.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
487098,496534,2015/4/7,5,"Was a huge hit at our Easter Sunday brunch!  So easy and a great combination of flavors.  Fruit, vanilla, and cinnamon...  How can you go wrong?"
2001098178,496534,2016/7/22,4,"I love this recipe. Very delicious, if made right. I have made this recipe before and had great success, but this time it came out very soggy and not cooked through. I put way too little bread for way too much ingredients. Here is the caution: make sure the next day that all or most all of the liquid soaks into the bread and frozen fruit works great but if you defrost it first you might add more liquid to the mix so it can also contribute to the liquid disaster. That is what I did. I would say to make sure it's mostly obsorbed into the bread before sticking it in the over or it might come out like mine did. I was so disappointed when I pulled it out of the oven and attempted to eat it. This recipe, I think should warn about that happening at least. Anyhow, I hope this held others to not make the same mistake.... Happy baking!"
1444263,507256,2016/7/7,5,"Well THAT was delicious! I made some edits to suit my pantry; celery seed not celery, minced onion, whole wheat flour, 12 oz evaporated milk plus 4 oz water not milk, 1 tsp garlic bread seasoning, 2 bouillon cubes, and a sprinkle of shredded cheese to serve. It was thick and rich and wonderful. Thanks for sharing and suggesting options."
2001837020,509130,2017/12/3,0,"Do not bake in a 9 x 13 pan any longer than 35 minutes, it was totally browned on top and done to perfection at this time!!!"
2141616,497059,2015/7/27,5,"I&#039;m so glad you created this recipe, it&#039;s great I love it."
2001553219,497059,2017/11/20,0,Why go to all this when a can of Progesso is no more than $1.99/can. Not worth the ingredients' cost or time.
2000623044,512306,2015/10/30,5,It&#039;s amazing! I had this dish at a pei wei last week...I really wanted to make it. This recipe is so close and even better.  I had a hard time caramelizing the sugar but it atleast was thick and melted. I served it over lomein noodles. Delicious!
2894594,501186,2013/7/8,0,Just signed into this page all in an effort to warn people that this recipe is horrible..ive had delicious coconut bacon many times..i tried this recipe and almost couldn&#039;t even swallow it..it is way to soy saucy and not sweet enough its like putting a tsp of raw soy sauce in your mouth..i recommend diluting this in half if anything and adding more maple syrup..also don&#039;t cook for 30-40 mins I would do twenty tops..

2244945,530478,2017/10/6,4,I will leave the last joint of the tail on next time and I hate cilantro!
2001606947,530478,2017/10/24,5,We loved this. Easy and delicious item for a group appetizer or light evening meal. It's a great new way to eat those shrimp.
2001821397,530478,2017/11/23,0,Think that you can make them ahead and put in the fridge for a couple of hours?
2002124892,530478,2018/5/5,5,Amazing dish! Had it ready when my wife walked in the door and she loved it.
2002168508,530478,2018/5/29,5,Ive renamed this recipe as shri-gua-ton aka shrimp guacamole wanton and convinced my parents im the genius behind this kitchen. They liked shriguanton so much they pretended to agree with my lies.
453440,530478,2018/6/16,5,"I have this recipe a number of times and it's time for a review. They make great apps or a great lunch or simple supper. I pre-fixed the shrimp for the oven per the recipe the first time and I discovered that my homemade Cajun Seasoning provided shrimp that were too hot for for us. (1/2 Tabl. works better for us.) If I don't have wonton wrapers, I have used phylo cups or taco chips. These are &quot;Delish&quot; and a favorite. Thank you."
2002093000,530478,2018/7/27,5,"Have been making almost the same thing for years! I use crescent roll dough rolled out thin., pressd into muffin baking tray. Am definitely going to try the wonton wrappers next time! Thanks!"
2001635836,530478,2018/9/4,5,Made these for a dinner party. Everyone loved them and easy to make.
169430,513171,2014/11/20,5,I used 1/2 the sugar cranberries in this and we enjoyed this lovely side with ham steaks and biscuits this evening. Simple to put together and very tasty. Made for For Your Consideration game.
1287956,515137,2014/4/6,4,"First off, to keep the recipe to five ingredients as per the contest, I deleted the ham (the eggs weren&#039;t listed on the ingredients list).  I also couldn&#039;t find my muffin pan, so I just made cups with some aluminum foil that I had used an old jelly jar as the mold.  However, this was really delicious!  It&#039;s a bit more work than I would like for a breakfast, but one of my daughters didn&#039;t get to try it because she had gotten home from a date too late and slept in, so her twin ate her &quot;basket&quot;.  If I make this again, I&#039;ll probably add some chopped onions to the hashbrowns just to give it a bit more flavor."
2002198350,523023,2018/6/26,5,"Love this one too!! I make and sell burgers, too many unknown ingredients in shop bought, so decided it was time to make my own buns. So glad I found this recipe. Being vegan, I subbed flaxegg instead of chicken egg. Worked great. Forgot to add it a couple of weeks ago and it still turned out perfect, so I just omit the egg completely now. Recipe makes an amazing loaf of bread too. Doesn't last even half a day in our house as everyone guzzles it down. Thank you."
636915,513069,2014/3/4,5,"These are fantastic!!! When I make them, my husband won&#039;t even stay out of the crock pot until they are done! My eight-year-old actually requests that I make them too!"
22015,513069,2017/10/29,5,"I've made these twice within the last couple of days. I don't use my slow cooker though, I bake them uncovered at 350 for about 30 minutes. So good that I have been using this as a side dish. I will be making this a lot and will think of Sharon when I do."
804550,513069,2017/10/30,5,"Such a clever and easy recipe! I used crimini mushrooms as suggested. The mushrooms taste delicious and they are good both hot or cold. I sliced them and used them as a side to lamb chops. I will be making these again and again. Made in memory of Sharon123, an amazing Chef and friend."
502302,499288,2013/4/24,0,"Thanks for posting this. I&#039;m not faithful about saving all veggies but do save onion and celery and use them when I make chicken stock. You have inspired me to broaden my horizons a bit. I don&#039;t agree that this can be water-bath canned though. Vegetables are low-acid and need to be pressure canned. It would be best to just refrigerate or freeze the stock.If one really wants to can it, here is a step-by-step instructions. http://www.culinate.com/mix/dinner_guest/how_to_pressure_can_stock"
803584,499288,2014/10/29,0,"I have done something similar to this for a few years, but I do not &quot;can&quot;.  I put all my vegetable scraps in a freezer bag and when I have a couple of them, I put them in a  crock pot with water, seasonings, etc, on low for as long as I can, strain it and put it in a freezer bag and freeze it.  Then I use it when needed."
1086570,493075,2013/1/11,5,What a tasty recipe. The inclusion of the veggies especially the chick peas was wonderfu. I did 6 hours and te chicken was so tender and moist. The recipe was a little confusing to me. Questions like how do you slice the carrot . Do you slice them. I suggest a baseline of how much oregano to use..same with salt and pepper..Thanks so much for a great recipe.Jan 2013
2597942,497962,2013/6/15,5,"Just to say ahead, this rating and review is strickly based on hubby&#039;s approval (I do not eat beans). That said, he loved them! I did cut the batch in half since he was the only one eating them. I served this along with Recipe #439463, and he decided to spoon some over his hotdog. This was super simple and inexpensive to make. I plan to make a full batch next time to take up to our cabin when we go with the kids and grandkids (per hubby&#039;s request). Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR) I forgot to mention, I didn&#039;t bother with the crock pot. I simply made it all in a Dutch oven and lightly simmered on a stove top burner (stirring often). Thanks again."
679953,518096,2014/9/3,5,"Made this as written, though I only used the peanuts as topping.  Very easy quick recipe.  The coconut/lime made for a great flavor for this too.  Know that it was a hit, when it is real quiet for dinner, and all the plates are clean."
1706426,495348,2013/3/1,4,"We really liked this, but I thought it was too sweet. I'd cut down on the brown sugar by half then you'd have a real winner! Thanks for posting, made for Dining on a Dollar,2013"
340141,503505,2013/9/2,4,"My picture doesn&#039;t do this soup justice.   The chicken broth reduced down nicely, and the combo of mushrooms and shrimp--in terms of both taste and texture--was very good.   The fresh lime juice is what moves this from &quot;okay&quot; to &quot;very good&quot;, so be sure not to skip it.   Very easy to make.   This could serve 8 people only as an appetizer.   It could serve 4 adults only if you also provide bread, salad and dessert.   ZWT9"
80353,502699,2013/8/21,5,"These were so pretty and delicious.  We make a very similar recipe in Greece.  No problem eating these - with a family of 5, they were gone in minutes!"
1802713408,505164,2015/3/31,5,Delicious! This recipe is one of my favorites. Make it about once or twice a month. I serve it with rice and a vegetable. We never have leftovers on this!
2684129,493963,2013/2/8,5,Looks luscious and I can't wait to make it this weekend!  bpoulin
2001553195,523492,2017/5/25,3,"Really liked the crusts consistency, I should have spiced it up more, it was a little bland. I would suggest adding red peppers and a generous pinch of salt and for my toppings maybe add garlic and vegan Italian sausage."
2001974823,523492,2018/2/4,5,It turned out delicous!!
1072593,529095,2017/7/11,5,"Telephone in the food.com mail account supreme court office ringing...ring, ring, ring... Hello...hello!!! Oh there you are... Delish and made for a beautiful presentation. p.s. Toast the pecans for a real treat."
1678694,529095,2017/7/18,4,"Easy, and delicious flavor.. not sure I'm on board with the texture of the pureed pumpkin itself.. but the texture of the oatmeal is great. Probably would taste wonderful with cubes of baked fresh pumpkin or squash."
375073,499075,2013/9/23,4,"I made this and it is delicious. I added diced onion and peppers too for a little more flavor. However, I would probably add either another roll of sausage or some bacon next time for just a little more meat. Makes a good filling for breakfast burritos!"
1236480,499075,2013/10/8,5,"Made this today for lunch, so good. When I make again I will add some bacon"
9137122,499075,2013/10/20,5,Very good recipe! Next time I will add lots of green chiles and mix it with pepper jack cheese! Add some bacon too-just because!!! Serve it with tortilla&#039;s and fresh grapes( in season right now)!!! Perfect! Stress free breakfast. If you use a small crock pot plan 8 hours and for a larger crock pot 6 hours is perfect!
1800198867,499075,2013/11/6,4,"DE-LIC-IOUS!!! I enjoyed how easy this was to make. I was very surpeised when I read the nutritional information, so I think i&#039;m going to find some healthier ingredients for it. Other than that, it was a hit with my family."
2594341,499075,2013/11/12,5,Super easy to make!! For our homeschool cooking class my kids did everything except cook the sausage onions and bacon.. We added a pack of Kirkland bacon and I caramelized a large onion and added those along with a small palm full of herbs de provance it tasted yummy except I think the cooking time was a bit much I noticed after about 41/2 hrs mine was done looking but I let it cook the minimum time stated and the bottom was very burned but we just scraped it off and my kids LOVED it so we will be making this again!!!
43209863,499075,2013/11/28,5,"Simply WOW.  I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast. The incredible aroma of this casserole woke me up and I could not wait for the family to wake up so I dug into it and I was not disappointed.  Will definitely add some spices/chilis to it next time, but it is so yummy the way it is. I did cook mine a little over 8 hours on low and was still nice and moist....the edges got a bit brown, but I like that.  This will be a recipe that will be used quite often.  Who would have thought a crock pot would make such an awesome casserole."
1800362300,499075,2013/11/30,3,Made this last night. Tastes yummy except the hash browns were too mushy. Any ideas on what I could do differently so they won&#039;t turn out like that next time?
1800054678,499075,2013/12/4,4,This is an interesting recipe which turned out surprisingly good! I used Italian spicy sausage to heat up the casserole. The taste was excellent! Will try with bacon like other reviewers suggested next time.
1801516946,499075,2013/12/29,0,Worst tasting thing I&#039;ve ever made.  It was just awful.  Complete waste of about $15!
1801573005,499075,2013/12/30,0,"This is very bland when made as directed.  I would decrease the dried mustard and amp up the flavor with sauteed vegetables - peppers, onions, spinach with liquid squeezed out, and add a tsp or 2 of dried basil.  Also agree that this was done much sooner than indicated - overnight is too long for this to cook."
1802390882,499075,2014/1/21,5,I made this for my extended family on a ski trip and it was a HUGE hit.  Everyone was going back for seconds and thirds.  Plus it filled the house with yummy sausage-y smells while we were sleeping so everyone was up bright and early.  I accidentally dumped the egg right over the hash browns when I was assembling it so I ended up tossing everything in randomly and mixing it up.  I skipped the mustard powder and garlic and doubled the onion.  Delicious!  We&#039;ll be making this one again.
149395,499075,2014/10/12,1,"I was not impressed. The result was significantly overcooked. I used a 7.5 qt. Crock Pot brand slow cooker and cooked for 7 hours. With less time or a smaller appliance, it might have been better. Also, the directins were unclear and there were ingredients listed that were not even mentioned in the directions. I have since located the original version of this recipe at All Kinds of Yumm blog with pictures for each step, which clarifies the process a bit. Will not make again."
10886410,499075,2014/11/18,5,"This is my breakfast brunch go to.. easy, cooks overnight, feeds a big group... life is good!"
1803519500,499075,2014/12/18,4,"Great foundation recipe ... I added pepperjack along with a mexican blend cheese, green chilis and chorizo = EXCELLENT!  No leftovers.  I used a 4 qt crockpot and cooked overnight.  With the changes we made it will remain a Christmas morning favorite!  The best recipes happen when you think outside the box!  Love it!"
9583442,499075,2014/12/25,1,"Great recipe if you want a plate full of raw, soggy hash browns! Not impressed at all, will not make this again."
1803563815,499075,2014/12/26,5,"I made this for Christmas Day brunch and my family woke up the next morning hungry for leftovers! It finished in approx 6.5 hours. I augmented the recipe by: adding cayenne and cooked bacon to the egg mixture, using hot Italian sausage, and excluding the mustard."
2000504731,499075,2016/1/2,1,No wher in the recipe does it tell you when to add the onions or the nutmeg.  I&#039;m confused.
2001042745,499075,2016/6/8,5,"Easy to throw together the night before for a large crowd in the early morning. I used 1/2 the hashbrowns, used mexican/taco shredded cheese and substituted the 1 onion with frozen onions and peppers. That added needed color and added to the taste. Adding diced chilies would be tasty as well. The casserole was done cooking in 5 hours on low in a 6 qt cooker."
2000773921,499075,2016/12/26,1,Recipie calls for too much hash browns. Needed a lot more salt and pepper. Mustard was a nice touch. Flavorless mushy waste of a dozen eggs.
2216338,515036,2014/3/30,5,I love Bruschetta!  Your recipe is so so good.  sw?.
1592049,515036,2014/3/30,5,So Delicious !! Love the Flavors!! 5-Star Recipe :-)
305531,517580,2014/8/8,5,"This was a nice and simple side dish to some Russian Bitky. I left the chopped green onions on the counter, but did add them after the photo. lol. Thanks  Lynn for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
174096,517580,2014/9/23,5,"Easy and delicious! Very flavorful, and fast and simple with only a handful of ingredients needed. Thanks for sharing! Culinary Quest &#039;14"
526411,507546,2013/10/23,3,"This was really easy to do.  I boiled the peppers to soften them a little, and I also browned the meat a little.  My  husband and I both think it needed something else to jazz it up.  I screwed up and put all the mazzarella in all at once.  It might have been good with some taco seasoning or something (I know- that&#039;s not Italian.).  I made this for New Kids on the Block Recipe Tag. Thanks for posting, Patty9901."
2689184,496520,2013/3/7,5,I love this recipe!  I made it for a quick weeknight dinner and it was really tasty.  Can't wait to make it again!
2235640,497417,2013/4/23,3,"We enjoyed this dish. Very creative use of ingredients! The patties were a bit difficult to hold together, I think a binder of some sort would help with that. Overall, a nice dish."
498271,504622,2013/8/7,5,"Boy we loved this coleslaw!  I used jalapeno pepper instead of scotch bonnet and left out the onions.  We really loved the spicy pepper with the sweetness of the other ingredients.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
131126,504622,2013/8/7,5,This was a nice spin on slaw!  I used green onions and a seeded jalapeno. The combination of sweet and spicy were a hit. Thank you for sharing the recipe!
107135,504622,2013/8/10,5,"wow oh wow this salad is good, i was a little  concerned  about  the combination ,don  be,it rock.i add bell pepper and t whole grain mustard ,thats about all the heat mr picky can take,make this one.zwt9"
169430,504622,2013/9/3,5,"I needed dinner last night and it had to be something cool. This was great. Loved the flavors, crunch and freshness."
895132,504622,2013/9/6,5,"Excellent coleslaw! The shredded coconut was wonderful in this along with the pineapple. I don&#039;t get fresh coconut here often, so I&#039;ll make this again as soon as I can get some again :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 Family Picks for The Apron String Travelers"
46167780,505484,2013/9/3,2,I liked it but no one else in my family did. And 4 hours is too long on high.  The chicken was over cooked maybe it should be 4 hours on low.
1800047148,505484,2013/9/5,5,"Husband, kids &amp; I all liked this recipe very much.   The only things that I did differently from the directions was I used 5 frozen boneless chicken breasts and put them in the crockpot frozen (not thawed at all) on the LOW setting for 8 hours.   They practically fell apart getting them out of the crockpot."
1800095278,505484,2013/10/2,4,"Recommend using frozen chicken and slow cooking it for 8 hours on low.  I altered this recipe to include 1/2 bag of frozen chopped kale and 1 bag of frozen cubed butternut squash (or you could use sweet potatoes).  Also used 3x as much minced garlic, and maple flavored balsamic vinegar to give it some sweetness, but I&#039;d recommend playing around with different BV flavors to find the one you like best.  All together this made for a very healthy, low calorie recipe that everyone enjoyed."
1800149706,505484,2013/10/24,0,"I cooked 3 large bone in breast 8 hrs on low.  I did use fresh onion as well as dried but the end result was lacking in flavor. I de-boned and broke up the chicken,returning it to the pot, then added one container of Cambells Slow kettle style &quot;Portobello Mushroom and Madeira Bisque&quot;, cooked on high for a few minutes .  It was wonderful over mashed potatoes and rice.  This would easily feed 6.  I would do boneless breast next time and save thee de-boning process."
1800243580,505484,2013/11/13,0,"Oh my goodness!  This has to be the most tasty way to cook chicken thighs, and they just fall off the bone.  My 4 teens and their respective others loved this.  We rate new recipes by &quot;YES cook this again&quot; and &quot;No go ahead and pass&quot;.  This was &quot;YES&quot; in all caps!  Thank you so much.  I will look for more of yours."
1800294716,505484,2013/11/22,5,I made this the other night and WOW it was a hit!!!  It is so easy and tasty....everyone loved it and could not get enough.
1800457084,505484,2013/12/6,5,&quot; This is definitely  one to cook again.  Everyone in my family liked it including  my picky kids. I do how ever suggest cooking it on low instead of high&quot;
1801723605,505484,2014/1/2,0,"Y&#039;all. My husband won&#039;t eat anything and he loved it! (I didn&#039;t tell him the chicken was thighs, and he normally doesn&#039;t even like dark meat!) My one year-old also enjoyed it! The chicken was so tender it basically melted in my mouth. However, as other reviewers have noted, 4 hours on high is probably way too long, depending on your crock pot. My crock pot was definitely done at three hours, although I left it on low for the last hour before it occurred to me that I could just check the temperature (duh). I am guessing one hour on high and three on low would probably be the best practice for food safety and taste, at least for my crock pot. I will definitely make this again!"
673444,505484,2014/3/21,3,Attempted frozen breasts on low for 8 hours and they were terribly dried out. Would definitely recommend thighs over breasts. It was nice and easy to throw together before work though.
1802661130,505484,2014/4/11,5,"OMG,,, I sort of added double on the garlic powder,, and used oregano instead of basil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wanted to climb into the crockpot and lick it out, lol!"
1689980,505484,2014/5/19,4,I was impressed by the ease of this recipe. I&#039;m more of a multi step cook and am just warming up to the slow cooker. This recipe made me a believer. No leftovers and cheap to make. Surprisingly good! I served with green beans and baked potato.
229476,505484,2017/10/14,5,"I first saw this on FB; tried it, liked it, everyone else liked it, and I've handed out the recipe frequently. I was going to enter it here if it wasn't already posted. That's how much I enjoy it. Simple preparation and great results."
1179225,528546,2018/10/23,5,"Great recipe! What a delicious and healthy way to start the day. I lightly toasted the quinoa before cooking just to take that green taste off, a personal preference. Thanks for sharing this keeper recipe."
1803317133,506549,2014/11/8,2,The nutritional facts leave out the French-fried onions. The carbs listed by French&#039;s are 3g per 2 table spoons. There are 16 tablespoons in a cup so two cups of French-fried onions would be 48g of carbs. if you divide this by 3 services you get 16g of carbs per serving just from this item. even if some of the mix falls off or is not use this is way more carbs per serving the most low carb diets allow for one meal.
323186,502689,2013/8/15,5,"Just fabulous, what can I say!    I had to use diced chicken breasts as I didn&#039;t have thighs, but it didn&#039;t make much difference,  we really liked that this delicious dish didn&#039;t contain cream (I&#039;m a horror at throwing cream in everything), I loved the lemon slices and DH loved the olives!   very easily prepared, redolent with flavour, a new favourite!   I might just add that I added the coriander with the lemon slices and olives, hope that was right, and used a little for garnish.   Great recipe, thanks Lynn, made for ZWT Pink Panthers On The Prowl"
599450,503484,2013/7/15,5,"This is so fast, fresh, and delicious. Best of all, I always have these ingredients on hand and can just whip this right up! Served on steamed broccoli, although I cannot wait to try with steamed green beans and cauliflower. Thanks, Jostlori! Made for ZWT9 for my fellow Gourmet Goddesses teammate."
480195,503484,2013/9/4,5,"I used this on steamed green beans, and it was very, very good. I love recipes that are simple and delicious. This made a bowl of steamed green beans special! Thanks for sharing the recipe."
2847680,500923,2013/6/1,0,I haven&#039;t actually tried this yet but it sounds SO YUMMY!!!  :)
1832331,525649,2016/12/30,0,Que pasa? The recipe directions do not mention whether/when to add the beans? I bet the soup would be better with some of those 15 beans!
2001996022,536747,2018/9/6,0,THANK YOUUUU!!! I'm dying waiting for this tutorial!!! I've been always wondered how you made those fluffy pom-poms!!!
2001285346,536747,2018/9/6,0,Such an art Beautiful

1460111,536747,2018/9/26,0,"Very cute cake! Love the marshmallow pom poms. However, you'll never get 30 servings from a cake with less than 3 cups of flour! Maybe 10-12 servings."
2708004,514519,2014/3/21,5,Jambalaya Macaroni &amp; Cheese. . .genius!  All the flavors worked great together.  We have a new family favorite!
126440,516908,2014/6/27,5,Great salad for a warm day.  I loved how the flavors meld together.
2002204947,516908,2018/7/2,5,I've made this same recipe b4. It's amazing. Didn't even want to share. Lol. Costs a few bucks but so worth it. Thank u ????
2002289421,516908,2018/10/1,5,I've made it too..been buying it for years sometimes they forget the gorgonzola too lol..however at 8.99 a pound ..id rather make it myself
266635,498666,2013/7/5,5,"Delectably delicious!  These cupcakes are well worth the effort and sooo good!  The cherries just ooze out of the cream cheese filling and then you have the scrumptious cupcake itself surrounding it. I ate mine with a fork because I didn&#039;t want to miss out on any of it.  I didn&#039;t add any icing -- they were great just as is. Will definitely make these cupcakes again.  Made for PRMR, July, 2013."
2001767296,516718,2017/12/21,0,"FYI, milk is not listed on the ingredients, but is part of the instructions. ??"
2001553308,516718,2017/12/22,0,You need 1/3 cup plus 1 Tablespoon of milk if you read through the recipe you will find this info. Marcy B
226863,510615,2014/5/15,5,"I loved this!  I have found I really love cooked radishes, and this was no exception.  The sauce hid a bit of the flavor which would be good for those who are scared of cooked radishes.  Really enjoyed the cashews.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game."
169430,502941,2014/10/7,5,I already had harissa made so this was super quick and easy. For the rub&#039;s first outing I simply added some to ground beef and enjoyed a very tasty patty with some leftover bulger salad after a busy day in the city. The patty was delicious. I have some New York Strip&#039;s in the freezer and am looking forward to using it on those. Thanks for another winner BK. :D
145352,499622,2013/7/28,5,"I&#039;ve been seeing this all over Pinterest for months and found it here. Glad it was posted!! This took a little over an hour to make, but it was good!! The fresh basil on top when served was key, as was some Parmesan."
1619087,499622,2014/7/9,0,This dish is SO GOOD ! The sauce has depth and the flavors linger on your palate.&lt;br/&gt;I especially liked that the pasta/sausage ratio was far less than the veggies. Loads of color on the plate. Will definitely make again and again.&lt;br/&gt;Makes sure to top with additional fresh basil and shaved Parmesan !
1803654931,499622,2015/1/13,5,"We LOVED this!  I&#039;d actually found this exact recipe on two sites, and slight variations on two others.  Next time I&#039;ll take a picture and post - with all the peppers, basil, parsley and Parmesan garnish - it&#039;s a beautiful and colorful dish.&lt;br/&gt;--On the other site, it mentioned you could substitute egg noodles since Pappardelle noodles are hard to find.  Instead of 8 oz, I used a 12 oz package.  &lt;br/&gt;--Also, I was afraid I and my youngest child wouldn&#039;t like the spicy sausage, so I used regular sausage (not &quot;sweet&quot;, not ?breakfast?).  &lt;br/&gt;--I didn&#039;t measure a 1/4 cup of of Basil; I used an entire 2 oz package, which looked about the same.  &lt;br/&gt;--Other than those adjustments, I followed the recipe exactly.  &lt;br/&gt;--I live at a high altitude, so cooking pasta always takes me longer than the package says.  I don&#039;t know why, but this dish took me about 55 minutes from start to finish.  I&#039;ll start the noodles sooner next time; I think I can get it down to 45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;--We eat large portion sizes (3 of us had seconds!), so for us, it served 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My youngest likes sausage, but didn&#039;t like this sausage, nor does she like peppers.  So she basically ate the tomato sauce with the noodles.  But my spouse, oldest and I all LOVED this.  We?ll be adding this to my menu rotation!"
8630713,499622,2015/1/19,0,"My husband and I loved this recipe.  We used fettuccini instead of the Pappardelli, which was really good.  Have been passing this recipe along."
2909864,499622,2016/5/31,5,AMAZING! This recipe is so so good. At first I was worried by the list of ingredients and instructions but I had everything in the pantry and it was really easy to make. The best part my hard to impress Chef husband loved it. Raved about it. This is going in the rotation and it looks so pretty I'm also gonna use it to impress guests. You've gotta give this recipe a try.
632585,499622,2017/2/6,5,I make this recipe once a month. (My preferences are Jimmy Dean's Sage Sausage and Stewed Tomatoes).
1803092493,516628,2014/9/1,4,The is a wonderful hot afternoon drink to cool you off. I would have given it 5 stars but i would have added 1 to 2 oz of simple syrup to taste
226863,512173,2014/4/1,5,"These were really good.  I would have preferred to heat them up before covering with the sauce, because I wanted a hot side.  But I followed the directions, and enjoyed them with the warm sauce and and the cold beans.  Think next time I&#039;ll time the sauce and the beans to come off at the same time so I&#039;ll have a hot side dish.  Loved the toasted nuts!  Made for Photo Tag game."
865936,527485,2016/7/25,4,"I liked this sandwich a lot, I did fry the bananas first and used my own Halayang Ube. I also used a small Portuguese roll instead of sliced bread."
2423055,497145,2013/3/11,5,We love gnocchi and this sounds so quick and easy! Looking forward to trying it! nj
2201427,497145,2013/3/22,5,What a wonderful recipe!!  Italian comfort food ..... at it&#039;s best!!  Thanks for sharing!
1802386274,509506,2014/1/20,0,"Wonderful flavor and the meat was so tender.  I didn&#039;t have any cabbage so I used brussel sprouts instead, and it was delicious. I also served it over rice and the juices made the rice even better as well!  LD"
2001287195,526984,2016/12/10,5,"It tasted delicious, and It was healthy! Yo could NOT taste the almond milk. It tastes just like regual pancakes with regular milk."
2001322861,526984,2016/12/26,4,"A little bland..I like buttermilk pancakes better. My family liked them, though. I used 1 cup whole-wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour. You could use coconut flour for a portion of the total flour, also, to add protein and fiber. Makes them heavier, though. Thank you for sharing!"
2001378096,526984,2017/2/4,5,This was great! My daughter &amp; I cooked this and she loved it.. Shes only 8 ??
2001429082,526984,2017/3/11,5,"love these! i added nuts, 1 banana, nutmeg and cinnamon"
2001538664,526984,2017/5/15,5,"I halved the recipe, omitted the vanilla, eyeball a teensie bit more sugar, and used stoneground whole wheat flour. PERFECT PANCAKES."
12264795,526984,2017/7/8,5,Probably the tastiest almond milk pancakes I've tried. I used melted coconut oil instead of canola oil and sugar instead of splenda.
2001620174,526984,2017/7/9,5,"This was actually a great recipe! I needed one that specifically used almond milk because that's all we had in the house, and chose this recipe over the one featured on the feedfeed, which oddly had a high rating but major problems with the baking powder proportion. I used real sugar and upped the vanilla by about .5 tsp, and they turned out pretty delicious."
2001658032,526984,2017/8/5,1,"Disgusting. Batter was thin and runny, don't cook up and stuck to both pan and griddle (used ghee) and lacked any and all flavor. Water my ingredients. Could have made a Dutch baby with a lot less effort and more result"
2001956498,526984,2018/1/27,0,"These came out great! Loved the taste and the consistency was the same as any pancake. Although I would note that you MUST use a granulated sugar or substitute, if you don't, they will be runny!"
2001956680,526984,2018/1/27,0,"I had already started mixing my dry ingredients, when I discovered that I was out of almond milk, so I substitued coconut milk. OMG these were the best pancakes ever!!!"
2001974089,526984,2018/2/4,4,"I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk on top of the vanilla in the recipe. Perfect aroma! I also whipped the egg whites with the sugar and folded it in carefully before cooking so the pancakes would be super light and fluffy. The only thing I'd change is adding an extra tablespoon of sugar, and maybe some cinnamon and ground ginger for some extra flavor!"
2002166178,526984,2018/5/27,5,"Wow. These worked out great. Cosistancy was just right, proportions we're good. If these weren't good for you, then you didn't follow the directions."
2002232434,526984,2018/7/28,5,This recipe hits it out of the park! I didn't have canola oil so used coconut oil which added a layer of deliciousness. Also added fresh organic blueberries. This is now our go-to pancake recipe. Thank you!
2001929880,534868,2018/1/13,4,"This soup was really tasty. It had a nice lemon flavor. The orzo came out a bit too soft. I followed the recipe exactly, excep I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen. I will definitely make it again."
2002234756,534868,2018/7/30,5,"This is my go-to recipe for this soul-soothing soup. Simple and delicious, the bright lemony flavor is a hit with anyone who tries it."
1803629773,504231,2015/1/8,5,Just made this for Dinner. My wife loved it.Not very healthy but your making a tater tot meal so sure you are not looking for healthy. One of the best I have had.
450980,506459,2017/11/29,5,"Perfect Batter! I sprinkled a small amount of pepper &amp; salt on afterwards as they cooled on paper towel. Flavor was amazing as well, so simple but so tasty!"
2002265055,526984,2018/9/3,5,"I never keep real milk in the house, and so I always sub almond or cashew milk in my pancake recipes and they’re always a little “off”. This recipe was great and the pancakes were very fluffy."
2002287306,526984,2018/9/29,5,These pancakes are amazing. My daughter and I made them today and wow! Fluffy and flavorful. We used unsweetened almond milk/vanilla flavor and 1 cup organic flour with one cup whole wheat flour. She wanted chocolate chips so mixed in and she loved them.
2002311650,530500,2018/10/25,5,"Sounds delicious! Please Pete be so kind as to tell us, if this oil is made in advance can it be used for a week or two weeks without losing too much of its potential? Should it be refrigerated? Or should only the freshly prepared one be used? Thank you!"
286566,502140,2013/10/24,5,"I made the one omelette but it was so filling that I ended up sharing with the DM, with toast I could only get through half but thoroughly enjoyed what I had, thank you ElizabethKnicely made for Photo Tag tag game."
220348,503967,2013/7/22,5,"This was made during a bbq and I have to say it was really nice. I enjyed it very much and it can easily be doubled. It&#039;s also best to drink it right away, too."
226863,505293,2013/8/20,5,"Because the title of this recipe is &quot;Grilled&quot; Chick N Wrappers, and the intro says it is made with grilled chicken, I decided to do just that and grill my chicken instead of cooking it in the skillet per the directions.  I used one boneless, skinless thigh per wrap.  This was a delicious little wrap, and I look forward to having the one leftover for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PRMR tag game."
128541,505293,2013/9/20,5,"I wish I&#039;d have done like Breezermom and actually grilled these, but I was short on time, so in the skillet they went.  No matter, they were delicious, and even the kids loved them.  The crunch from the veggies was delicious.  Thank you for sharing!"
2000100100,500101,2015/3/30,5,"Oh. My. Goodness.  These cupcakes were spectacular.   I omitted nutmeg for health reasons, but just one bite made it feel like Halloween in my house.  And the icing- well, my picky eater children completely flipped for it, it is amazing.  Wish I could give more than 5 stars,  lol."
323186,498066,2013/4/29,5,"Very nice, Miss Fannie!!!    Easily prepared, I was generous with all ingredients although I kept the cheese mix according to recipe,  you dont want to overdo the mayo, I think.  I also held back on extra seasoning.    I made my own shortcrust pastry, used muffin tins, and got an even dozen tartlets.  They look good, they smell good, and by golly, do they taste good :)  I sprinkled the thyme onto the tomatoes, hope that was right.  These delicious tartlets were made for PRMR tag game.  Thank you Miss Fannie!!"
128473,498066,2013/5/8,5,"Wish I could give you 10 stars for this recipe, it is that good. Quick, super easy to make, with results that will blow you over.  The flavor of these tarts is amazing, sweet, savory,with bacon and cheese, what more can I say...So, so tasty, my dh &amp; I both didn&#039;t talk much while enjoying this treat...all that could be heard was mmmmmm. I got 10 tarts out of the recipe, used 1 tomato and 5 pieces of bacon, everything else was as listed.  There are no directions for where to add the thyme, so I left it out and honestly didn&#039;t miss it. I just wanted to add that I only cooked the  tarts for 28 minutes, my convection oven runs hot.  We will definitely be enjoying these little babies again soon.  I have placed your recipe in my Favorites Cookbook for 2013. Kudos to you."
266635,498066,2013/6/3,5,"These tarts are really delicious!  They are almost too cute to eat, but we managed somehow.  I went light on the onions and did not use any salt because of the bacon and cheese.  I made half the recipe -- they are really easy to make and have a great presentation. Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag, June, 2013."
695933,508968,2013/11/6,5,"I did two potpie One the way Annacia did it and one to play with, I did your way by the &lt;br/&gt;recipe. Yes I did made a few alterations to my way, I can&#039;t leave anything alone! I have to play with my food. I did adjusted to my personal taste. Your way is Simply one of the best chicken potpie I have tasted and my family loves it. This is my first time making this one, this my way and decided to use Sherry Cooking Wine in my way, definitely tasted a lot better than White Wine I think. I would recommend a bottom and a top crust, but cook the bottom crust for about 5 minutes that way your bottom crust will be more crispy. Also, add a 15 oz can of diced potatoes and cut the frozen vegetables to 1 cup of carrots or corn and 1 cup of peas (if you like them) and I mixed everything in one pot this time and still turned out GREAT!!! Too many dishes for this old man to do, like last time I did one. It turned out beautiful and brown. I let is rest for almost an hour. It was perfect to cut into, maintained its shape. What awesome comfort food! This is excellent only if you cut the poultry seasoning to 1/4 or 1/2 tsp. 1 tsp is way to much and overwhelms everything else! The second one we made, we cut the poultry seasoning to 1/2 and it was great! I now have two ways to do this. We think you get 5 Stars and for me 4 Stars. Cant wait to make your way for a Pot luck! I will definitely make this again, again. A lot !! I am jealous because I lack some of your skills !! Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to y&#039;all!....PRMR 2013.....Grpa"
2597942,508968,2013/11/8,5,"This is a very good recipe. It by far beats my MIL&#039;s recipe, which used canned mixed veggies. I did the onion option, just because I didn&#039;t want to run to the store for leeks. The only 2 changes I made were to cut the celery down to a 1/4 cup (because I don&#039;t care for it that much) and I replaced the 1 cup of mushrooms with 1 cup of thawed, diced Potatoes O&#039;Brien. I had to cheat and use a store bought pastry in the tube, but it worked out fine. I will try the homemade pastry topping another time (and there will be another time). Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
266635,508968,2013/11/17,5,"Talk about comfort food at it&#039;s best -- this dish really delivers all the wonderful goodness that you expect from a chicken pot pie!.  I made just a few changes (only because of preference) and left out the celery and pepper -- I added extra mushrooms and carrots. I reduced the chicken broth and added additional half &amp; half - why not?  Served with a salad for today&#039;s lunch -- it was really delicious.  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
128473,508968,2014/4/14,5,"Wow, wow, wow, the ultimate comfort food.  Needless to say, picky dh was in heaven....he loved it Annacia.  What&#039;s not to love, flaky homemade crust, tender chicken and vegetables all engulfed in a smooth, velvety cream sauce.  Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe.  Made for my pac baby....Spring 2014."
2002332060,508968,2018/11/14,0,"There is ABSOLUTELY nothing to change on this recipe! It is WOW WOW WOW. I will say, however I did not have the cream on the second cooking so I used cream of mushroom soup. It was still delicious but not quite as tasty My husband did not notice the difference. Thank you so much for this recipe. I am adding it to Grandmas collection for my Grandchildren. Thanks again! Jonnie Burton Carolina Shores NC"
482933,516191,2014/7/9,5,Excellent! Love versatile recipes like this. Sauce is perfect. Did add cilantro with basil and would do again. I altered recipe and won&#039;t do again and noting here as my notes are so difficult to get to since recipe box fiasco--I made slurry of corn starch and water and it clumped recipe says to add to wok and will follow directions next time and there will be a next time. :)
486725,493077,2014/12/23,4,This looked too good and interesting not to try. And it was definitely good in a weird kind of way. I did halve the tartar sauce and cheese (and both were more than enough for our tastes). All the flavors were good together and this was well enjoyed.
482376,493747,2013/3/20,5,"Great General Tso&#039;s flavor without the fat. I love that this recipe is healthier but doesn&#039;t skimp on flavor. It is a very easy and quick recipe to throw together, too! The sauce is wonderful over rice. This is great for a weeknight meal. Thanks for posting! Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef."
2001111716,493747,2017/8/22,0,Have made this dinner 3 times now. It is fantastic. Although I have made some changes to it (Just to suite my taste) This meal is quick and fun to make. Try it. You will not be disappointed .
482376,516296,2015/8/30,4,"Wow this is one spicy drink! I do like spicy, but this was even a little too much for me. I ended up adding more gingerale and wine to even it out a bit. I did enjoy the watermelon puree. Made for CQ 2 - Texas."
128473,494415,2013/2/17,5,"What a winner of a recipe. Made exactly as written, wouldn't change a thing.  It has everything you could possibly want taste wise in it.  So much flavor; sweet, tart, tangy, hot and lingering. The pork was wonderful, tender, moist, perfectly cooked with a nice sweet and hot topping.  The salsa takes it over the edge with its bright, bold raw flavors.  Even my picky dh loved this recipe, Kudos to you CaliforniaJan for this recipe, which I will be making again."
2722645,497026,2013/3/12,5,"Our new favorite pasta dish~! Great for a night when you forgot to take something out of the freezer. Quick,easy and everyone loved it~!"
254614,494117,2013/2/4,4,"The broth taste was very good. You can definitely taste the peppercorns and bay leaf.<br/>By squeezing the tomato the broth was not clear. I cooked the vegetables ala dente,<br/>everyone enjoyed the hamburger rice and vegies after I cooked the vegies until soft, not<br/>slightly hard. I also turned the cabbage wedges over so they would cook all the way through.<br/>The taste was delicious after cooking more and adding the Ranch Seasoning."
865936,500689,2013/10/25,4,You just cannot go wrong with bulgur!  I served this as my entire lunch by itself.  I will be making this often.  I like to use bulgur in place of rice and it is much quicker and easier to cook as well as having protein in it as well.
2000498330,493015,2015/12/1,4,Very different (from any stew I have had). Pleasant orange flavor that blended well with the other ingredients. Something I would make when I want out-of-the ordinary.
1588111,498263,2013/3/30,5,We had this for a family brunch. Really tasty!!
2414156,494631,2013/2/23,5,This sounds amazing! I am making this on Sat.! Wonderful!
2190033,494631,2013/2/23,5,"Another great looking dish, Nancy!!"
2324285,511701,2014/5/7,4,"I&#039;ve actually never had collard greens before, but I cook often with the other ingredients in this recipe so I was curious to try it.  The greens came out pretty good and the seasoning was spot-on, but the dish does taste pretty heavy.  Next time I&#039;d probably use light coconut milk."
125923,498263,2013/12/25,5,"Absolutely delicious!  I made it for Christmas morning and it was a HUGE hit with everyone.  Very easy to make the night before.  I did not add the pecans because nobody in the family likes pecans, but I did everything else as instructed.  Still delicious.  I didn&#039;t eat my serving with syrup and it was great.  Other people did and said I should try it, but by that time, I was full."
198971,509519,2015/1/9,5,"This method works extremely well, and since I started using it I haven&#039;t made hummus with canned chickpeas. The extra effort is absolutely worth it! I add a teaspoon of salt to the overnight soaking water - a Cook&#039;s Illustrated tip for brining dried beans."
1072593,509519,2015/1/20,5,"Surely as green apples in July and ripe blueberries in June, I&#039;m gonna make hummus.  So much better than using the canned stuff."
1962164,509519,2017/2/9,0,"I used 1 tsp baking soda in 1/2 lb. soaked chickpeas. They turned brown and very mushy. I found, on my next trial, that the baking soda was totally unnecessary."
2001801544,509519,2017/11/17,5,"I came upon the best trick making this today! I found a way to filter out all the skins without having to peel/pick off even one! it's so laborious to do, and I just never would and then would be stuck with a disturbing amount of skins.... after i cooked them enough (it only took 10 mins), i drained them and then put them back in the pot and filled it with cold water; 1. to stop the cooking 2. to expedite the process of getting them in the freezer. when i started swishing the cold water around, i noticed that the skins started floating to the top! before letting them settle, i carefully drained just the water and yes! just the skins got filtered out! I did this several times until there was NO skins left!! This is very exciting for me :) look at all the skins that came off, none of which i had to do by hand!!"
2324285,512056,2014/1/28,4,"This is definitely a unique chili.  It&#039;s not really spicy at all, but that&#039;s ok.  The bacon was a good addition, and the cream cheese adds a nice subtle creaminess.  Ultimately, I thought it was a bit bland, so I used plenty of adobo seasoning to perk up the flavor.  I would love to try making this with cooked chorizo instead of chicken one day, as that would really end up being flavorful.  Served with tortilla chips and topped with plenty of pickled jalapeno slices."
2420655,494631,2013/2/24,5,We tried this and loved it!  Thank you for such an easy and delicious recipe!
2001079926,529730,2017/6/19,0,So the veggies are not steamed or stir fried beforehand?
1800048734,495292,2013/9/6,5,Love Love Love this recipe!
1800142510,495292,2013/10/21,5,So good! So easy! &lt;br/&gt;Chicken and Noodles doesn&#039;t get any better than this.&lt;br/&gt;Grandma would be jealous!
1800170025,495292,2013/10/30,5,"This recipe had the BEST taste. I would recommend 3 cans of broth though and the noodles I used (frozen Reames noodles) only took 30-45 minutes to cook, so for my first time the recipe ended up a little thick. But I will adjust those 2 things next time I cook them."
2948599,495292,2013/12/13,0,"Honestly, I did not have high expectations for a such a simple recipe, but it was yummy, warm, and comforting. My hubby and I both enjoyed it, and I&#039;ve made this several times already. I used boneless- skinless thighs just as a personal preference because I feel the flavor is more"
2914638,495292,2014/1/19,0,I added chopped carrots and celery....pretty darn close to my Grandma&#039;s! Yum! Serve over mashed potatoes and you are in comfort food carb heaven!
1800326497,495292,2014/2/12,5,I make this all the time for my daughter and she loves it!!  I use the cream of chicken with herbs.  Gives it just a bit more flavor.  Super easy and great for those winter nights.
2000462564,495292,2015/9/8,0,Made this today for dinner simply delish!!! I added some garlic powder to it so tasty!! Will definitely be making again
1307852,529381,2017/9/21,0,"I haven't tried this, I was looking for some other reviews how other people like this recipe......"
2001649551,504126,2017/7/30,5,Awesome!
1802502595,495292,2014/2/17,5,I have been looking for a good chicken and noodles recipe for my crockpot. I found it with this one! It was amazing. I did add carrots and celery as well as one extra can of chicken broth. Plenty of pepper too. The frozen noodles (which I never used before and couldn&#039;t even find at the grocery) really made the recipe. I only had the noodles in for about 45 minutes. Served over mashed potatoes. Easy to make and so delicious. Plenty of leftovers for dinner tomorrow. Wow!
1802620779,495292,2014/3/26,0,This is delicious!  Tastes just like my what my grandma used to make. All 5 of my kids and my hubby love it.  Tonight I am making a quadruple batch of it for our youth group.
1801494644,495292,2014/8/10,1,"I don&#039;t know why this has such high reviews. It was absolutely awful! Salty, mushy, no complexity. We couldn&#039;t even force it down. I threw it out and ordered a pizza. Such a waste."
1803036053,495292,2014/8/16,5,"I love this simple recipe, especially in the winter. I always add peas and carrots and it reminds me of my mothers chicken and noodles"
2749148,495292,2014/9/3,5,"This is the BEST chicken and noodles recipe! I made it last night and we loved it! After reading the reviews first, I added 3 cans of chicken broth instead of two and it was PERFECT. Couldn&#039;t have been easier or tastier. You just put the chicken breasts, broth, cream of chicken and a stick of butter in the crock pot and cook on low for 6 hours, then shred the chicken, add the frozen noodles (I use Reames frozen egg noodles, they&#039;re seriously the best and closest to homemade.) It all cooks 2 hours longer, the noodles plump up and cook to perfection. &lt;br/&gt;This recipe would be perfect for potlucks, football games, a good hearty meal after a day of Christmas shopping, for anytime really!! It wasn&#039;t too salty (I used broth with less sodium) and it definitely wasn&#039;t mushy, like another review said. It came out perfect. Thanks, Barbacious, for a keeper in the recipe file!"
2057047,495292,2014/9/9,4,"Comfort food!  I made this for the first time yesterday.  My husband and ten-year-old really loved it!  I thought it was too salty.  (My husband usually salts everything but didn&#039;t put any extra salt on this.). Next time I will use a couple cans of reduced sodium cream of chicken soup.  I added some pepper and plan to add a little bit of carrots and celery next time.  Will definitely be making this often, especially during the cool fall and winter months."
1671995,495292,2014/10/3,4,"I love this recipe, &amp; have made it several times, but with modifications. First, I use a 22 oz. bag of diced chicken, &amp; throw it in frozen. Second, I use the family sized (26 oz.) can of cream of chicken soup. Third, I use only a 12 oz. bag of dry medium egg noodles, &amp; that is plenty! The first time I made this I saw that 24 oz. of noodles wouldn&#039;t fit in my 6 qt. slow cooker. And there was no excess liquid by cutting the noodles in half either. I also put the noodles in for the last 30 minutes only, &amp; that was long enough, &amp; they didn&#039;t break down."
488244,495292,2014/11/13,4,"Very good and it couldn&#039;t be easier to make.  Added an extra can of broth and some onions, carrots and celery.  And probably a little more noodles than it called for, but I was trying to stretch it into a enough for two meals.  I&#039;ll definitely be using this recipe when I make chicken and noodles from now on."
1803357919,495292,2014/11/17,3,Easy to make but a large meal for just two people so I have a lot leftover. Might try less noodles next time.
1026614,495292,2014/11/19,4,Super easy and tasty!  I added a little Rosemary.  Served with crusty french rolls for dipping in the sauce!
1803455287,495292,2014/12/4,5,"Serious comfort food! I got a late start, so I cooked the chicken on high for 4 hours along with the butter, broth, and cream of chicken. I also added carrots and celery, after reading the other reviews. After shredding the chicken and adding the noodles, I turned the pot back down to low for the last two hours. I then added some frozen green peas and black pepper. It was great! My pickiest eater went back for seconds."
1800054678,495292,2015/1/2,5,Extremely easy to make and yummy. I served this chicken noodle with fresh parsley and fresh ground pepper. Great comfort food!
2000390617,495292,2015/8/9,5,"That looks so delicious ! Chicken and noodles always goes well together :)
That could be good for summer :) But you know whats good for summer ? Spicy food as well :)
I found a recipe for spicy fried squid with vegetables. U should all give it a try :) U can get recipe here : http://affimity.com/#/sharedPost/1/12139"
56251,495292,2015/8/25,5,"This has to be the best comfort food ever!   It is always wonderful when you have a recipe that the whole family loves, and this is one of those!  Easy to do in the crock pot,  I made just has stated, came out perfect!  Delicious!"
2000887056,495292,2016/2/22,5,"I made this and added 3 1/2 tablespoons of Fresh Thyme and Fresh Rosemary, about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt,  one large whole choice of garlic peeled, and Fresh ground black pepper. I also added one extra chicken breast, and I use about 42 - 48 ounces of chicken broth. I also take out the process chicken in the cream of chicken soup ( I don&#039;t like the process chicken) :) WOW, this is So Delicious!!! I&#039;ve made it several more times. I&#039;ve shared it with my parents, neighbors, and my husband&#039;s business partner. Everyone loves it!!! I have passed on the recipe giving everyone the extra things I&#039;ve added:) Peace and Blessings"
2000943999,495292,2016/6/8,5,"Delicious! I'm so happy to see recipes using real noodles, not the fake ramon chemicals. Thank you so much!"
1118761,495292,2016/9/21,1,"This recipe looked like it would be absolutely delicious! Well I did not enjoy it at all. We cannot get frozen noodles here so I used packaged ones. Not sure if the frozen ones are better or not but will never know. It was super tasteless. I even add onion to it. It made a ton so I froze the leftovers but now not so sure it will ever get eaten. Sorry, I tried. :("
2001328492,495292,2016/12/30,0,"I followed the directions and it tasted great, but was pretty dry. Everyone ate it up and I will definitely make it again, but I think it needed just a little more chicken broth or soup, and/or maybe a little less noodles."
2001347654,495292,2017/1/11,0,Tried this recipe for the first time tonight and it was awesome!! My husband loved it!! I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup with herbs and 3 cans of chicken broth as suggested by others and the flavor was amazing!! My crock pot is very hot on low so I did not have to cook as long as the recipe said. My chicken took about 4 hours on low and after adding the noodles took just as hour longer!! This one is definitely one that I will make again and again and pass along to family and friends!! Thank you!!!
2001344006,495292,2017/3/5,4,"Made this tonight, with a few adjustments. Like other reviews, I added carrots, celery, and onions. I used a whole chicken, and deboned it after 5 hours of cooking time. Left the liquid amounts the same but cut the butter to 1/4 cup and added about an hour before it was ready. 30 minutes before we served it, I added a cup of frozen peas. We used the No Yolks noodles instead of frozen. My husband had his doubts and is generally not a fan of chicken in the slow cooker. He loved it and went back for seconds!"
2001646637,495292,2017/7/28,0,Why did my noodles come ouy mushi. I followed directions couldn't even eat it. Terrible
2001680577,495292,2017/8/20,0,"I will do this with the organic egg noodles. They are much thicker and very good. Made with wheat flour, eggs and water. I will also 1 can of cream of celery soup as a sub and also add poultry seasoning and sage. I will let you know ;)"
1800340569,495292,2017/9/14,4,I made this for a party of 15. It increases nicely.
2001768251,495292,2017/11/7,5,"Talk about an easy and delicious recipe!! I made this twice in one week. I did use the 32oz size of chicken broth, I also put the chicken breasts in the crockpot frozen. I added extra pepper, but that's because I love it."
2001913366,495292,2018/1/5,5,"Love this recipe, it's quick and easy to prepare, and on a cold wintery night dinner is almost done when we get home! Add noodles, have some family time, and then eat a comfy cozy dinner!"
1499237,495292,2018/2/28,5,"This was good! Halfed everything, used frozen chicken breasts and whole wheat egg noodles. Will use this recipe again!"
2002210912,495292,2018/7/28,4,"I followed the recipe exactly and the taste was very good, just needed some cracked pepper at the table. However, the consistency was a bit gummy. I will try thick dry egg noodles added closer to the end of the cooking time. I will also try boneless thighs instead of breasts as they tend to be more juicy."
765933,495292,2018/8/15,5,"This is just like my church serves for their fund raiser, only better! People complain it is too thick; it is not soup! If it is too thick for you simply add more stock. Not rocket science!"
2002038893,495292,2018/10/25,3,"I cut the recipe in half since there are only 2 of us. It turned out more like a soup. I added cut up carrots for some veggies, used previously cooked cut up chicken breast. I would delete the butter. Just added fat and calories not needed."
2324285,496065,2013/2/26,5,"A healthy, flavorful stuffed potato... what more can you ask for from a side dish?  I enjoyed this a lot for it's simplicity and tastiness.  I mixed in some grated Parmesan into the stuffing mixture, and also topped it with shredded Parmesan.  Thanks for sharing."
2001731539,522575,2017/9/27,5,"I don't know how this recipe doesn't have any reviews. It's magic! Tastes just like full fat dressing. I've been using it as a sauce on tons of things....veggies, sandwiches, in recipes, on salads (mixed 50/50 with my usual dressings to cut cals)... I joined this site just to give this recipe some love!"
482933,496207,2013/10/8,4,"Versatile and great use of leftovers! Am glad I studied recipe because gravy is not in ingredient list but is in directions. I used 2 cups. Paula&#039;s original recipe does not list it either. And you do need it. Also, think the biscuit mixture is too thin and would reduce milk the next time. I used a casserole dish with deep sides. Thank you Elizabeth for posting."
39835,513187,2014/2/28,4,Very good bread. I made 1 regular size loaf and 2 mini loaves with this recipe. I did use the brown sugar option but otherwise made as directed. Thanks for sharing!
2399085,507397,2013/11/11,5,Made for PRMR! This is a very good crouton! We enjoyed them in our chopped salad tonight. I will make more and save until needed! Thanks
67728,504218,2014/5/10,5,"These may not be an exact replica for Cinnabon rolls, but they are equally decadent! My kitchen was pretty warm today, so I put the frozen rolls and sauce in the pan this morning, thinking they wouldn&#039;t be ready to bake for close to 8 hours, but they rose fully in about 4 hours. Super-gooey and rich, especially if your ice cream is Ben and Jerry&#039;s,  so make sure you have people to share these with. Thanks for posting!  Made for PAC Spring 2014"
844587,499472,2014/5/5,5,Super yummy and requested by all! We call this jalapeno popper dip in our house. It is well liked by all. I prefer it served warm with Juanitas corn chips myself :) (I also omit the jalapenos and just use the juice from the can of them if I am serving to the family/kids)
1803145693,499472,2014/9/17,0,this tastes like hot poppers without the mess! yummy
126440,499472,2014/9/20,5,Took this to Bunco last night and everyone loved it.  Served with Fritos.
1800061829,499472,2014/11/6,5,"We make this all the time, everyone loves it, even those that don&#039;t usually like HOT stuff.  Tastes exactly like the &quot;Jalapeno Poppers&quot; you get for Appy in bars or restaurants!"
2921828,499472,2015/1/12,5,Made this for the football game this past weekend and it was a huge hit! The pan was licked clean. I made the dip two days before hand then added the topping and bake when i needed it. I think this helped mold the flavors together. Perfect dip if you love Jalapeno poppers.
2000655639,499472,2015/11/8,5,Love this dip with Townhouse Flips! I have made it in microwave and it turns out just as yummy n bubbly. I have to give out recipe everytime I take it somewhere.
2000082992,499472,2017/4/9,0,"Not sure I will make it, the fat content and not mention the cholesterol is so high, but sounds wonderful."
323186,505152,2013/10/17,5,"I made this exactly as is,  other than, lacking fennel,  I used celery.    I wasn&#039;t sure when to add the green onions,  in the end I added them with the shrimp.  What an attractive and delicious dish, we felt that this was luxurious comfort food and I&#039;m thrilled to say that I have the leftovers for lunch!   I used local shrimp,   delicious .....   Thank you, Douglas, this dish was made and enjoyed for Think Pink, 2013"
2000332621,498090,2015/7/12,0,"I followed this recipe exactly, and this is the very best oatmeal raisin walnut cookie bar I have ever made! So moist and so yummy! So incredibly good and simple! BRAVO! I&#039;ve been baking for 40 years and never had my bars turn out this amazing! Thank you for this awesome recipe! Most Sincerely: DeRhonda Neff from Michigan"
2000382408,498090,2015/8/20,5,"Awesome, chewy and delicious cookies, I just made a second batch because my family couldn&#039;t stop eating them! Super easy recipe."
2000816861,498090,2016/9/7,5,"This has got to be THE best oatmeal cookie recipe I've made, and I'm a baker. My usual &quot;go to&quot; oatmeal cookie recipe is the Grandma's oatmeal cookie recipe on the top of an old-fashioned Quaker oats carton, but it's made using shortening. I like the way butter tastes better (and believe it or not it's healthier than shortening) and this is the second time I've made oatmeal cookies with butter. The texture and consistency was perfect and it wasn't too sweet or cinnamony. I followed the recipe exactly the way it said, except I pre-soaked the raisins in warm water for an hour before adding to the batter so it wouldn't be too dry. The walnuts were super delicious!"
2001356603,498090,2017/1/18,5,Made these tonight! Added half raisins and half cranberries &amp; walnuts. Deeeeelicious recipe!!!! And fairly healthy!? They're great!
2000698768,498090,2017/3/6,5,Perfect. I added chocolate chips for even more yummy flavor.
2001503727,498090,2017/4/24,5,I made the cookies and they were delicious! Will make them again
2001977971,498090,2018/2/7,5,Exactly like the picture. Recipe is a keeper!
45608710,513516,2014/11/17,0,These are great cookies.  We have also been making them since the late 60&#039;s early 70&#039;s.  Recipe came from a family friend who made my mother promise not to give it out.  All of my kids loved them and are still a favorite of our family.  Very festive at Christmas.  I use a leaf tip to make the leaves.
2000763285,513516,2015/12/22,5,I make these every Christmas.  They are delicious as well as festive and colorful.  My children and guests love them!
267579,513516,2016/12/23,5,My mom used to make these when I was a kid. I didn't think I'd ever find the recipe. Thanks!!!
37449,511709,2014/1/20,4,Lots of good stuff in here to start the day!  I used cherries  and flax seed. A great breakfast. Thanks!
1802770623,511709,2015/8/1,5,"My favorite recipe for overnight oatmeal. This is a great starting point, I&#039;ve kept the oatmeal, milk and chia seeds the same but I switch the fruit up for whatever I have on hand."
169430,514044,2014/8/20,5,I made this as tonight&#039;s dinner served with just a mixed green salad. It was excellent on a sweltering Aug evening. It&#039;s very simple to make as well as to enjoy.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014. Yummy
1072593,493868,2013/4/5,5,"You  know what I love?  A great recipe, having all the ingredients handy and a friend with a good attitude who drops by just as I&#039;ve made lunch.  I&#039;m so sappy. *PAC Spring 2013*"
266635,493868,2014/5/2,5,"Made your delicious Reuben sandwiches for lunch today.  Used your Louie dressing and made them in my panini maker.  Will definitely makes these sandwiches again.  Made for Spring PAC, May, 2014."
2324285,496883,2013/3/24,5,"These are truly delicious and just overflowing with flavor.  I liked the avocado cream, although next time I&#039;ll use about half the amount of lime juice as it was a bit overpowering (or maybe I just had a really juicy lime).  Great recipe- thanks for sharing!"
2736381,497447,2013/3/14,5,"I tried it - Fantastic.  Very simple to prepare.  Easy directions to follow.  Tasted Great.  Light Fluffy, healthy.  Add just a touch of salt and Lemon and it is a perfect main course.  I highly recommend it!"
2765447,497447,2013/4/1,0,"Yummy, and surprisingly easy to prepare. Can&#039;t wait to make this again!"
204024,498664,2013/4/11,5,"Rich flavor of ingredients, easy to make.  The thickness is just right.  I used this on chicken thighs. Made for PAC Spring 2013."
1873232,518460,2015/9/9,2,"This dish was nothing at all like the dish it is trying to copy, and it was pretty bland, too. I had to add a lot more teriyaki and seasoning to make it palatable. I may try it again sometime, but with revisions. Frying the noodles in some sauce + brown sugar might actually make them caramelize."
169430,504850,2013/8/2,5,"Just what I needed to complete tonight&#039;s dinner. This is a lovely and flavorful salad that would be so easy to enjoy on it&#039;s own as a lunch. The dressing is a treat and I think I&#039;ll be making this again soon, it&#039;s a winner. Made for ZWT 9."
47892,504850,2013/8/8,5,"All I wanted was a simple salad to go with our main dish and this delivered. I used fresh toms, lettuce and onions from our CSA box, too. Lime zest was added for garnish. Made for ZWT 9."
37449,504850,2013/8/11,4,I enjoyed this easy to make and easy to eat salad. I didn&#039;t have radishes so used some jicama which worked nicely. Thanks Bethie! Made for ZWT#9 2013 by one of the Hot Stuff.
199848,504850,2013/10/13,5,"Simple and good.  I used halved grape tomatoes in place of roma tomatoes, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  The radishes and tomatoes add nice color to the dark leafy greens.  It would be a nice first course salad.  Thanx for posting!"
135470,508332,2014/4/29,5,"This is a delicious treat, the Kahlua and brandy are very complimentary to the vanilla. I will enjoy this just as much on the 4th of July as Christmas! Made for Spring photo tag."
679953,508332,2014/12/1,5,"Great stuff.. I did scale this down dramatically, by making a 1/2 a quart.. by using 1/8 bottle of brandy, and an 1/8 bottle of Kahula.. that was donated by one of my neighbors, in exchange for a couple of drinks.  I also used  a 1/3 gallon of vanilla ice cream.   The nutmeg, I gradually pinched in to the desired taste, but did use very little,"
865936,517529,2014/8/21,5,This salsa is very easy to make and quite tasty.  I did not use the optional ingredients.
226863,517529,2014/8/22,5,"Very easy to make and delicious!  Love avocados, and knew I would love this.  I did use the optional ingredients and loved the chiles and tomatoes!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Culinary Quest Summer 2014."
174096,517529,2014/8/25,5,Excellent! This was so flavorful and delicious... loved the added crunch of the various veggies. I included the optional ingredients. Thanks for sharing! Culinary Quest &#039;14
527607,517529,2014/8/26,5,Since I am the only one who loves avocado i cut this down to one portion and had with tortilla chips as part of my lunch.   Loved it.
80353,517529,2014/9/14,5,"Excellent flavour combination that made a lovely, meatless sandwich.  I stuffed my veggie mixture into a lightly-toasted pita pocket.  No mess with stuff oozing out.  Loved every bite!"
1925885,517529,2014/9/19,5,"Delicious, Jackie!  I loved the change-up from the usual lime juice. And, the addition of the bell pepper. Instead of a chopped chile, I added a few flakes of crushed red pepper. I kept mine chunky and served it up with some substantial chips. Wonderful!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
1179225,517529,2015/1/10,5,"Nice find! I mashed the avocado instead of leaving it in chunks, used parsley and left out the optional chili and tomatoes. I thought I might miss the flavor of lime that I&#039;m used to, but the vinegar was wonderful in this as well as the bell pepper and just the right amount of onion. Oh...and I didn&#039;t add the oil, it didn&#039;t seem to need it, maybe I would use it if the avocado was left chunky.Thanks for sharing this keeper."
865936,517847,2014/8/28,5,Very good sauce.  I found it very similar to a chimichurri because of the oil.
2001563320,531334,2017/5/31,4,The amount of almond flour is incorrect. What would be the correct amount for 6 donuts?
440735,503698,2013/8/29,4,Good Chowder!  It took me longer than 20 minutes to prep and 30 minutes to cook.  I used 1 teaspoon of Recipe #14190.  I also used Old Bay for the seasoning for the crab boil seasoning.  I love crab but I felt it overpowered the rest of the chowder. Next time I will increase the corn to 1 3/4 cups or 2 cups and increase the cajun seasoning 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 teaspoons.  Made for ZWT9 for the Gourment Goddesses July 2013.
2002105643,536223,2018/8/8,0,Chocolate chips??
2180168,511445,2014/1/2,5,Love love love!!!!
168771,511445,2015/5/19,5,Excellent dish and easy to make.
659599,493684,2013/2/2,3,"I made this using half Fuji and half green apples.  The oatmeal crisped up nice and crunchy, but next time I would reduce the sugar some."
2001739925,528086,2017/11/7,5,"I made this recipe twice in the past week (I had a lot of zucchini). The first time the only change I made was to use a combination of ground pretzels and saltines since I didn't have any panko on hand. The tots had a slightly bitter taste. I was thinking the Italian seasoning had something in it that gave the tots the off taste. The second time I made the recipe I left out the Italian seasoning altogether. I didn't have quite enough of the ground pretzels and saltines left (I was using a 1/3 cup measure this time), so I filled out the measuring cup with seasoned bread crumbs (probably only a tablespoon or two. The tots were outstanding! Apparently whatever seasoning that was in the seasoned bread crumbs was much better than the dry Italian seasoning. This is a simple and uncomplicated recipe for an excellent side dish. I did use a 1/3 cup measure for everything that called for a 1/4 cup measure."
1800292505,509363,2018/12/18,5,I made this for a crockpot social at my work. This is an inexpensive recipe. I made a quadruple order. Growing up with this dish and making it in the recent years it was always good but too salty for me. This recipe by BrairCraft was very good and I did not feel salt logged after eating a couple of servings over toast. It will be going in my recipe box. Thank you
2000292208,535518,2018/4/13,5,"Sounded &quot;kinda&quot; nasty to me, but I tried it. Turkish eggs is a big surprise and tasted great. You have to taste it to understand it."
2001960791,503112,2018/1/29,1,Way to much flour and not enough liquid! You only need about a cup a flour.
2735897,496824,2013/3/13,5,This was just DELICIOUS!  :-D
2286251,527442,2016/11/1,0,"Since I don't have a donut pan, can I make these into muffins or brownies instead?"

2428011,493958,2013/2/11,5,great recipe
30534,493958,2013/2/14,5,Delicious ! I made the soup as directed using 3 chicken breasts and 48 oz of chicken broth. The p-armesan cheese rind gave the soup a wonderful flavor.
2692330,493958,2013/2/14,5,Made this recipe and it is delicious! Very easy.
2684101,493958,2013/2/17,5,"I've got everything in my cabinet except the shallots.  Going to make this next week, it's time for soup! Here is the update. Very good soup and love the fresh ingredients. My family really enjoyed it and I will be making it again."
2685532,493958,2013/2/19,5,Finally got to give this one a try. It fits in well with me trying to improve my diet to include lots of colorful vegetables plus a nice dose of healthy protein with the chicken and beans. I used regular carrots cut into bite-size chunks instead of baby carrots.
832476,493958,2014/6/3,5,"A hearty, filling and delicious soup.... I had no Hidden Valley ranch mix so made my own.  Also added a couple bay leaves, a couple dashes of hot sauce.  Simmered for about 1 hour to marry the flavours. At the very end I added about 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro/parsley combo. Try to use fresh tomatoes as the recipe states rather than canned, it really makes it!"
2674422,493959,2013/2/3,5,I could not stop eating this amazing dish! The burst of flavor mixed with the chicken was spot on! Another great recipe by Miss. Fannie!
865936,493963,2013/1/23,5,"This is a nice creamy noodle soup, seasoned just right.  The curry lends just enough heat to tickle the back of my throat the way I like.  The contest ingredients worked very nice here.  I would certainly make this again.  Very satisfying.  The only slight change was I had jumbo shrimp, which I chopped."
2677925,493963,2013/2/5,5,Looks so tasty!!
306726,493963,2013/2/5,5,Just like coconut shrimp in a bowl! Very tasty and creative!!!!

254614,493975,2013/1/22,5,Great taste! Nice. I would spray or rub grease on the baking pan. Use a bamboo small stick to hold the plantain piece to get the entire surface covered with the milk liquid. I also use some cinnamon with the cocoa and sometimes a dash of cayenne. Thank you for posting.
128473,500249,2013/5/27,5,"I love garlic mashed potatoes and these did not disappoint.  So yummy, great garlic flavor, soft tender potatoes, just the way I love them.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will make again and again.  It was quick and easy to make with great results.  Just perfect served with spareribs and green beans.  Made for New Kids on the Block Tag Game."
169430,501429,2014/12/19,5,Really scrumptious. This was a day when I was up at 5 a.m. and decided to make these lovely scones. I used the dried lavender and Splenda in the scones with a light sprinkle of the raw sugar on the top. Decided to the cut out method this time and they came out light and yummy for breakfast along side cardamom tea. Made for Sweet December Event
1762637,506917,2013/9/24,4,This was very good.  I used pork sausage instead of kielbasa.
1802360353,506917,2014/1/15,5,"I made this recipe last night. It was delicious. I used link pork sausage due to not having kielbasa on hand. Turned out really well. My hubby doesn&#039;t much like Navy Beans, he said...but ate 2 large bowls of this soup and said that he would like to see me make it again. It is now in my recipe binder for future meals. Thanks so much for posting this recipe."
227978,504735,2014/7/14,5,"This was such a tasty salad.  And after the scorching hot day we had today, I didn&#039;t feel like heating the house further by heating up something in the oven.  So I made this salad in the afternoon and kept it in the fridge to chill.  The dressing was simply wonderful with a light peanutty taste that went quite well with all the salad ingredients. I know I&#039;ll make this often, especially during the hotter summer months when slaving over a hot stove is just not in the cards.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Susie D.  We loved it!"

2684378,495967,2013/3/17,5,"Having these again for a quick side dish for St. Paddy&#039;s Day to go with our cornbeef entree. So easy to make that I am cooking these for the meal! Simply Delicious Potatoes, cheese and Brussels, three favorites all together"
2739289,495967,2013/3/17,5,"Great, comforting, and lots of veggies. Love it :)"

914360,495967,2013/3/24,5,Fontina is a favorite of mine...and brussels sprouts....this is a unique and delicious side dish !
2211242,495967,2013/3/24,5,reminds me of the St. Patrick&#039;s dish colcannon--perfect with corned beef
1592049,495967,2013/3/24,5,So Delicious!! Love All The Creamy AWESOME Flavors :-)
1196075,495967,2013/3/25,5,This recipe sounds very interesting!!!
2252910,493297,2013/1/18,5,"I may be the first to try this recipe,well, i tried it today and it was amazing,but as it was mentioned in the recipe notes I substituted buttermilk powder with liquid,and egg powder with flour,and everyone in my family loved it."
1742738,493297,2018/3/29,5,"Thanks TSG. Dixie Fry has been our family choice and we have missed it. I finally got our local Supermarket to carry it but after about 8 mons they pulled it from the shelves. Before Dixie Fry was bought out, it was not available East of the Mississippi. That may take a while to sink in since it was made in Birmingham, Al. The new owners now sell it in the South but I can't find it anywhere. I had to have a buddy from Phoenix ship it to me. Soon as I receive all the ingredients I'm mixing up a batch. Tallahassee, Fl"
136997,509423,2013/12/15,5,Very nice dish. I will cut back on the salt next time though. :)
200171,509423,2014/12/25,5,"I added lemon pepper, turmeric and madras curry powder AFTER roasting my cauliflower (I didn&#039;t look for recipes until late in the game...) it still came out AWESOME!  I had roasted the florets in olive oil and added some butter so that it would carmelize &amp; brown. I didn&#039;t add any salt because my lemon pepper already had salt included as first ingredient.&lt;br/&gt;So flavorful!  Thank you for this simple recipe!"
266635,504697,2013/8/7,4,"This pork roast and sweet potatoes make a nice meal.  I made the recipe as directed and marinated the pork roast for 8 hours.  The pork was nice and tender as were the sweet potatoes.  The marinade did not seem to penetrate the meat though as we really could not taste the seasonings once it was cooked.  I think this pork roast would benefit from a sauce to serve on the side or over the cooked pork.  Made for ZWT9 - Caribbean, August, 2013."
1072593,494182,2013/3/22,5,Hot! I heard you can hear my screams from Texas! *PAC Spring 2013*
902569,494182,2013/5/9,5,YES! Just what I was looking for and far superior.
13111443,494182,2014/8/3,5,Outstanding stuff! You can use about half a pound of habeneros and some shredded carrots for color instead of the cayenne if you want more heat.
56002,494182,2014/9/23,5,This was fun to make. I grew cayennes by mistake as the pots were labelled jalapeno :/. Tastes similar to Franks. Perhaps some aging time will make it taste closer to the real thing. Nice reddish orange colour.
2001144343,494182,2016/9/3,4,"Tastes similar,EASY to make,gave some to brother in law,2 days later he asked for more. Hubby says he isn't sharing. ��"
2001311111,494182,2017/3/17,0,"If you are using vinegar and salt, why do you need to refrigerate?"
185781,494182,2017/4/24,5,"Beautiful beautiful stuff! I don't have access to cayenne peppers, so I used what was available locally, which are smaller and much hotter than cayennes. I used a similar weight in chillies. I skipped the last step of simmering the sauce after blending it - the sauce was plenty thick already. We LOVED it."
2001507622,494182,2017/4/26,0,Where can I find canned cayennes?
2001655287,494182,2017/8/3,4,Great flavor but it's way too thick. I wish I could get the same flavor but have it thinner to come out of my hot sauce bottles more easily. I end up watering it down which kinda stinks
2001702923,494182,2017/9/6,5,Good flavor....decent heat! Made a double batch...filled 3 jelly jars.
131126,497119,2014/4/29,5,I made this in a bundt pan &amp; overall was happy with the result.  The cake is very moist and not as dense as expected. I was anticipating more of a cinnamon flavor and would increase the amount next time so it stands out.  I would also take better care in swirling the cinnamon/ sugar mixture.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  Made for Spring 2014 Pick A chef.
280271,512434,2014/5/4,4,These were yummy...I couldn&#039;t locate the dressing in the store so I made recipe #36477 but with cilantro and not the full amount...I cut the recipe in half...and thought I had legs...but instead they were thighs...so that&#039;s what I used...I also cooked these in the oven due to the weather and threw some fries to cook along side...for the last step I darkened them under the broiler...the skin was crispy but the dressing wasn&#039;t noticed...you can taste a slight bit of the paprika...this was a nice recipe to try...Made for Spring 2014 PAC...=)
2002115255,494182,2018/4/15,2,NO WAY! The key difference is Frank's hot sauce uses butter which coats your tongue and interacts with the capsaicin. BUTTER is missing in this recipe. ADD BUTTER
2002144249,494182,2018/7/13,5,Thanks for the recipe!
2002281524,494182,2018/9/22,5,This is our new favorite sauce! We are a low sodium family and don't add the salt. And it is still delicious!
2002282854,494182,2018/9/23,0,"Looks like Franks and has the consistency of Franks but, using dragon cayenne peppers, it’s much hotter than Franks. I’ll probably cut my next batch with more vinegar."
2002226089,494182,2018/11/20,3,"I just made exact copy. However, It has heavy vinegar smell. I used white vinegar. What is wrong? Does it have to wait lid open for awhile get that smell out?"
2001727299,535021,2018/2/4,5,All my favorite ingredients in one pretty package
2001146905,505675,2016/8/29,5,"Excellent recipe, one of the best I have found"
447383,505675,2018/8/11,5,I am making this recipe again. Everywhere I take this I get rave reviews. I also make fresh whipped topping. Great version.
126440,509643,2013/11/28,5,Great buns and rolls.  Made some for hamburgers and the some for Thanksgiving.  Very easy and great flavor.  Used potato flakes for the starch.
1802388769,509643,2014/1/21,5,"This roll recipe is awesome.  The texture was super fluffy, yet not full of air.  I have never made bread like this!  Definitely keeping for future use and to spoil the bf :).  For the butter use room temperature!  Thank you!"
1802514308,512670,2014/2/21,4,"I just made these and like them a lot. I baked them at a lower temperature, 300 degrees F, in a convection oven, and for a shorter time, 15 minutes, and the crust was a bit darker than I&#039;d like, next time I&#039;ll do 10 minutes. The topping is great, not too sweet, and moist and chewy- I also baked that for a lot less time, only 15 minutes at 300, and it is perfect. I have a serious sweet tooth but these are satisfying!"
370332,512670,2016/6/16,5,"Delicious! I made a double recipe in a 9X13 pan. I added 1/4 coconut sugar to the crust,since the poster said it wasn't so great. My boyfriend loved them (and ate 1/2 a batch) until I told him the filling was dates. Haha! I will absolutely be making these again! Thank you for sharing!"
2549237,507109,2014/5/5,4,"This was a pretty good tasting and fairly easy sauce to make.  It doesn&#039;t have the traditional taste that I am used to in a pasta sauce, but my family really did enjoy this in the lasagna I used it in.  I used this recipe with Baking*Belle&#039;s recipe for Recipe #143219 which I just added the vegetables in that recipe to at the end.  I followed the ingredient list precisely and then started to cook this on the stove-top as indicated and switched it to a crock pot for the 6 hour simmer time.  I had enough sauce for two meals, so the second half of the batch is waiting in the freezer for a hectic night.  Thank you for a great sauce Baking Barb!  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
2201427,515036,2014/3/30,5,Awesome recipe!!!!  This will be one that I make more than once!!!!  5 stars for sure!!
1458727,515036,2014/3/31,5,"I haven&#039;t tried this recipe, but how could you go wrong?  I saved it in three of my cookbooks, appetizer, veggies and breakfast."
2201870,515036,2014/4/4,5,Love this idea!
2667767,515036,2014/4/7,5,really great idea Ronna
1802651220,515036,2014/4/7,5,I like this one alot!
2200921,515036,2014/4/7,0,Yummmmmmmm
2192609,515036,2014/4/7,0,I love this recipe!
226867,511116,2014/12/18,5,"I must admit, I made some changes. I had cubed pork and misread the recipe, so I used it anyway. Also added some sliced onions. Both DH and I loved it even with the wrong cut of pork!&lt;br/&gt;Made for Nancy&#039;s football win 2014."
2002095181,531446,2018/4/4,5,"This is delicious, I used 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar instead of red wine, perfect recipe will definitely be cooking this again soon"
107135,513280,2014/3/10,5,this is so easy and tastes great
628076,513280,2014/3/20,5,We really liked this. I have one of those coffee machines that makes the coffee while it froths the milk below. I used some wonderful caramel sauce we got at costco. My kids wanted extra caramel sauce on theirs. We also used decaf. Thanks
267527,515601,2014/5/11,5,"Easy and very delicious. I had already made some lime-cilantro rice so used that, but did everything else. The warm, spiced lentils and rice are wonderful with the fresh cold carrot mixture on top. I&#039;ll use this again and again.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks,&lt;br/&gt;Jan"
679953,510961,2014/1/1,5,"One of the most best inexpensive recipes I have tried in a while.  Easy to make, and great also because the ingredients are fairly common, and I usually have on hand.  Cooking time was right on the money, and made for a great dinner.  BTW: family loved the recipe name too.  Made for PRMR&gt;"
1783373,510961,2014/3/4,5,"We enjoyed this recipe rosie316 especially in the season of winter because it&#039;s the epitome of comfort food.  So easy to assemble, I put it together in no time at all.  I followed the recipe to a T, except I added some onion powder and I didn&#039;t have Kitchen Bouquet so I used Gravy Master.  I also double the recipe because I was afraid that it may not have been enough for us.  Rosie, I didn&#039;t think that it was soggy at all.  We all enjoyed it very much.  Thank you rosie316 for posting.  Tagged it for PRMR."
2324285,510961,2014/3/12,4,"The best thing about this recipe is how easy it is to make, which was a boon because I was sick and just didn&#039;t have it in me for any big-time cooking.  I did not find the doodles soggy at all- they were like big dumplings in gravy.  The sauce was great, but I did not care for the chicken filling.  This was my first time using canned chicken, and I will probably never use it again.  I think this recipe would be even better with uncanned cooked chicken or even pepperoni or sausage."
204024,512979,2014/5/5,5,Fresh and delicious flavor.  Loved this.   Made for PAC Spring 2014.
2000004615,494943,2015/2/18,5,"Although these are not the same as the original, as a staunch Michigander paczki enthusiast, I thought that they were fantastic. I am living in Iowa right now, a land where not a packzi can be found. I made them today in order to explain why I was so lamentful about the lack of a food that most Americans cannot pronounce to my friends living here, and now they understand. Five stars for the persuasive and lovely recipe.

I used about half as much yeast as asked for, and the paczkis turned out fabulously. In addition, you can substitute the dark rum for pineapple juice with a dash of almond extract in a pinch. (College cooking gets creative.)

I will make these again. I&#039;m so happy."
2000669433,524488,2015/11/24,5,Absolutely Fabulous!!
1072593,494322,2013/8/7,5,"Sister#2 went on and on about these, but then, who am I to judge epiphanies."
679953,508577,2013/11/5,5,"Loved these, and a great way to do hamburgers on a bad weather day.  I had no problem removing these from the pan, and put a thin layer of Open Pit mild BBq sauce on this.  I think onion rings on these would work out too, but enjoyed these as is.  Made for PRMR."
212609,508577,2013/11/11,5,These were great tasting burgers...so easy to make that 6 year old DD gave me a hand ( which she loved !!!).&lt;br/&gt;Simple and effective burger recipe that we all enjoyed and will definitely use again.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR.
1783373,508577,2014/2/16,5,"My family really enjoyed these burgers.  I first had my doubts on how 1 1/2 lb.&#039;s of ground beef would cover the bottom of such a large pan...but it did.  I can see how this recipe is economical, especially for a large family.  If preferred, the ground beef can be spread in a smaller pan for thicker burgers.  I didn&#039;t have Hawaiian rolls (hard to find in my area), so I used regular burger buns, therefore it made 10 burgers, total.  We sprinkled a bit of McCormick Montreal seasoning over the top and next time we&#039;ll also use some barbecue sauce over the top and maybe some crispy bacon too.  Made it for Everyday is a Holiday tag game.  Thank you nochlo for an enjoyable meal."
227978,508577,2014/2/18,5,"So easy, fun to make, and quite tasty.  I left off the pickles (since I don&#039;t care for them), and I served these with some chips and a fresh cantaloupe.  It was enjoyable especially since we had such a busy night but this went together so quickly..  Thanks for sharing your recipe, nochlo."
1436160,508577,2014/3/4,5,These little buggers are delicious! The only issue I had was that the burgers didn&#039;t stay together very well.  I wonder if a slightly smaller pan would improve that.  I think I&#039;ll just have to try that. I used deli swiss and deli cheddar cheeses. I layed the slices on top of the burgers and put the pan back in the oven to melt. I served two burgers on each Hawaiian roll and I think it&#039;s still about 12 servings. These would be great for appetizers as well. Thanks for sharing! Made for Best of 2013 tag.
169430,508577,2014/3/25,5,Made these as directed except that I made them double sized for 6 burgers on standard buns. Straight forward burgers with a very good flavor. I&#039;ve never baked burgers before but it worked great (perfect for winter when you can&#039;t use the outdoor grill).
171790,495993,2013/4/27,5,This is a very nice mixture. So far I&#039;ve used to to season some mixed veggies. It&#039;s a lot more flavorful than plain salt.
107583,495993,2013/6/2,4,"Basically a nice mix, but we thought it had too much cayenne.  Will leave it out next time.  I &quot;pulverized&quot; my mix in a mini-processor so it would be easier to use in a shaker bottle.  Will use it on chicken and fish mostly, since we don&#039;t usually salt vegies anyway."
169430,514093,2014/7/10,5,Dee-Licious. I didn&#039;t have any feta so used some shredded Parm and that worked pretty well. This was chilled for about 3 hrs before eating and it was very nice. I&#039;m looking forward to having some tomorrow for lunch as it&#039;s the sort of thing that gets better with a little age. Must say that I loved the pine nut addition a lot.
560491,507358,2014/4/13,5,"This is a great egg casserole for being healthy!  I eat a lot for scrambled eggs with these save veggies mixed it, but this is so much easier to make and portion it out for several days.  I used Mrs. Dash garlic and onion seasoning and liked the little touch of heat from the jalapenos.  I sprinkled a little shredded cheddar on top when it was done cooking.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
131126,504937,2013/8/7,0,I am not leaving stars due to user adjustments.  I made this with (drained) canned beets and elected to skip the scotch bonnet peppers.  I think the heat would have offset the strong ginger flavor.  Thank you for posting the recipe!
2704971,495956,2013/2/21,5,Yum!  So awesome to have something this good when you're following a diet.  Thanks!
2705183,495956,2013/2/21,5,Great use of cottage cheese for someone who doesn't like cottage cheese!
1802385233,495956,2014/1/20,5,"This was so good it was hard not to eat the whole thing at a sitting.  I actually diivided it into 2 so I wouldn&#039;t be a little piglet.  I used raspberry sf jello &amp; made according to the package instructions w/ ice &amp; when partially thickened, I stirred in the cottage cheese and coolwhip.  I used sliced almonds as the nuts but when I make it again, I am going to just sprinkle some in.  Initially I liked the crunch they added but later wished they were not there.  Definitely a keeper!"
260673,495956,2016/5/9,5,"Great taste! I happen to love cottage cheese but I blended this in my Nutribulletbefore eating any, because the texture of cottage cheese in anything otter than plain by itself is gag inducing..."
494867,502985,2013/7/13,5,Super good!  This was so easy to make and was a delicious treat!  It tasted great as a slushie too.... In other words not all of it made it into the freezer... :-)
47559,502985,2013/8/11,5,This was so refreshing!  Great pineapple flavor with tiny bits of it in the sorbet.  The ginger flavor was subtle but delicious.  I had to have multiple taste tests as it was freezing in the ice cream machine.  :-)
1803072765,518190,2014/8/26,5,This sauce really livened up my typical turkey burger!
1803097783,518190,2014/9/2,5,Made this last weekend--it was so good!
1803097960,518190,2014/9/2,5,I&#039;ve been on the hunt for healthy meals that are easy to make and still have lots of flavor. This one hit the spot!
1803097935,518190,2014/9/2,5,Made these this weekend-Had the perfect amount of spice. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch today!
1803098080,518190,2014/9/2,5,Love the addition of the chipotle mayo combined with the avocado! Now THIS is a burger!
1803098205,518190,2014/9/2,5,This is so good!  Made it for dinner last night and gladly eating the leftovers today.  The A-1 adds a nice spice that isn&#039;t overwhelming.  Definitely will be going into my regular dinner rotation.
1803098446,518190,2014/9/2,5,Hands down the best turkey burger I have ever had!
1803099575,518190,2014/9/3,5,Made this over the weekend---a great twist with the A1! Definitely will make this again!
1803107237,518190,2014/9/5,5,I love turkey burgers to have some variety from hamburgers and this is an A+ recipe all the way!
1803107250,518190,2014/9/5,5,This was awesome!  My daughter who is very picky for a nine year old really loved it!  Move over plain hamburger - Turkey Burgers rock !
1803121573,518190,2014/9/10,0,"I am a huge football fan.  At half time, it has to be pizza or burgers.  My daughter had  me over to watch a game and she served these turkey burgers instead of the &quot;traditionals&quot;.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have to say, they were awesome.  I had two of them.  The chipotle mayonnaise was great.  Turkey burgers will also likely make my doctor happier than the red meat variety as well! &lt;br/&gt;Great half time repast!"
305531,502737,2013/8/3,5,"Yummy. I sure need lessons on how to cut a corn cob into pieces. I ended up getting my knife part way thru the corn and then just pounded it on the cutting board to finish the job. I had corn kernels and &#039;milk&#039; all over my kitchen. lol.  I used a lemon and really enjoyed this corn. It was also messy to eat, so make sure you have lots of napkins handy for this one. Thanks Sharon for sharing. Made for ZWT9."
135470,502737,2013/8/5,5,"We really enjoyed the corn this way, the spices with the olive oil and orange were just yummy!  I used a pinch of cayenne and some chili powder so not to be too hot. I misread the recipe and mixed the spices into the oil which worked out fine. I liked that I didn&#039;t miss butter at all! The only down side for us was the mint sauce, we both felt like it didn&#039;t go at all flavor wise , so skipped it after the first bite. Thanks for a great recipe Sharon! made for ZWT 9 Caribbean by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers"
1925885,502737,2013/8/5,5,"Very good!  I grew up eating it in a very similar way.  We grilled the corn and then used a slice of lime to spread a spicy chili blend on the corn, then salt.  I really liked the orange and the use of the olive oil.  The spice mix was just the right &quot;temp&quot;, but we didn&#039;t like it with the yogurt sauce as it didn&#039;t really seem to go with the spices and wasn&#039;t necessary on the &quot;delicious&quot; scale!  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT9 Team Gourmet Goddesses."
526666,502737,2013/8/11,5,"We enjoyed the spiciness of this corn - I found the dipping sauce to be a little weird, but that&#039;s just me, and my tastebuds yearning for butter on my corn on the cob. ;-) Trying to stretch my &#039;wings&#039; a little, so I did eat it as directed, but may skip the yogurt sauce next time, personal preference only. Thanks for sharing, Sharon123."
286566,514750,2014/8/10,5,"I scaled back for 1 serve and what delicious tasty and filling serve it was.  I couldn&#039;t get snow peas so used sugar snaps and omitted the spinach as I didn&#039;t realize I was out of it and I julienned the ginger and left in as I love a bite of it as I am eating the soup.  Thank you TeresaS for a great lunch, made for Food Friends and Fun and For Your Consideration tag game."
65502,502956,2013/7/17,5,"Another fantastic recipe from Dee! I made 1/3 of this recipe and my son and I split it for dinner tonight. The crunch of the celery, the bright yellow from the organic eggs, the mixture of the tuna and the large shrimp - all of these things came together wonderfully. Made for my fellow Tasty Tester for ZWT9. Thanks Dee! :)"
386585,502956,2013/7/22,5,"What a delightful salad that is chock-full of flavor!  I made this exactly as posted, using small pasta shells.  I mixed the mayonnaise with the seasonings before adding all the other ingredients, and it tasted delicious!  The star of the show here, believe it or not, is the white pepper, which really brought the dressing up a notch!  I did use grape tomatoes instead of chopped tomato, which worked out perfectly.  Will definitely make this again!  Made by a fellow Tasty Tester for ZWT 9."
169430,502956,2013/9/5,5,"This made a perfect chilled dinner last evening. I made it up in the early morning and just placed it on a crisp leaf of green leaf lettuce. Dee, you&#039;ve done it again. This is delicious and satisfying and simply ideal for the summer heat. Made as written and wouldn&#039;t change anything."
212609,502534,2013/7/11,4,"A different way of making meatloaf for me....but good nonetheless!!&lt;br/&gt;This method makes for a truly moist and tender meatloaf, yet it still holds together beautifully when sliced.&lt;br/&gt;I covered the kids slices with regular BBQ sauce, and mine and DH&#039;s with our old favourite ( courtesy of the gorgeous gailanng!!) recipe #430587.&lt;br/&gt;Deeelicious....all plates cleared and lips smacked! Plus, as it was SO easy to throw together, maybe even DH can make it for dinner!!!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
39835,502534,2013/7/28,4,"Very good and different meatloaf -- which held together very well (which I have problems with sometimes) - our&#039;s was rather spicy, but we picked a spicy bbq sauce and I think ourbacon had some pepper in it too. We cooked it in a loaf pan, added 10 minutes to cooking time but other wise made as directed with some minor changes. Thanks for sharing!"
2549237,502534,2014/3/2,5,"This meatloaf was excellent!  I doubled the recipe to have enough to feed 10 for a dinner with family tonight.  Everyone was raving and I had to give the recipe to two of my sister-in-laws.  In order to crisp the bacon I baked it in the oven while the meatloaf was baking.  I upped the baking time to an hour, then added the barbecue sauce and sprinkled with the bacon and baked for the last 15 minutes.  I am so glad that I chose to tag this delicious recipe.  Thanks nochlo!  Made for PRMR."
323186,535570,2018/10/29,5,"I wish there were more stars!!!! To die for, is all I can say. We could have eaten the whole casserole (2 of us), the leftovers are not going to be leftovers for long!!! Thank you for sharing a super yum casserole, oh, I did in fact use thinly sliced salami because I had just bought it and it was a good chance to use it. Other than that, yum yum yum!"
386585,498485,2013/4/18,5,We&#039;ve been enjoying these regularly since the recipe was posted here (made it 3 times)!  The pimento cheese is really tasty and is a unique touch.  Thanks for sharing this much-enjoyed recipe!
2531880,514128,2014/3/11,5,"This seemed like a very long time to cook, but as I had the time, (kept busy doing other things), I cooked it.  What a delicious and wonderful surprise we got!   Thank you for sharing such a tasty recipe.  I served it as a main course, and made exactly to the recipe."
1802574121,514128,2014/3/11,5,I have not cooked this for myself  but the person who posted this is a good friend. I had it for dinner at her house before and it was GREAT! She has introduced me to some tasty treats!
2000683461,505114,2015/11/16,2,"2.5 stars. 
The flavor was good but unfortunately every component was a little off.  

The cake: 
Flavor - great. 
Texture - dense. 
I switched the vanilla extract for coconut and that helped boost the flavor. 
The cake almost reminded me of a corn muffin texture. Not sure if the coconut milk weighed it down, but it was a heavy thick batter. 

The filling: 
First, 1 cup cream made wayyyy too much. If you make this, start with only 1/2 cup cream and keep the same 1 mango. This should help boost the flavor without giving you too much leftovers. To cut out the hole, I used a melon baller

The frosting: 
With the addition of the mango there was just too much liquid to make the buttercream set. It was very running and I tried all of the tricks to make it emulsify. Also, the flavor was really dull so I brightened it up by adding lemon zest. 

Overall the tweaks I mentioned above helped intensify the flavors, but not enough that I&#039;d make this recipe again...which is disappointing since it has so much promise"
128473,499695,2013/5/8,5,"This made for a lovely meal.  The potatoes were crunchy and tender, perfect with the bacon and a little salt and pepper.  Served them with oven baked chicken and roasted heirloom carrots for a memorable meal.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Kerena."
2597942,499695,2013/5/15,5,"I made these last night to serve with my home-made Rouladin (I normally serve mashed potatoes, but decided to try this). I&#039;m so glad I did! It went along perfectly with the dinner. The only thing I did differently was I had to put the sheet pan on the grill (our gas stove/oven isn&#039;t working). I started them on high, then lowered to medium and gave it all a good tossing. (I believe they cooked for about 25-30 minutes). I did chop the bacon (into lardons) at the half way point when I tossed everything, and mixed the pieces in with the potatoes. (I&#039;m thinking this way of making potatoes and bacon pieces would be great to use in a warm potato salad! I think I may try that someday). This recipe would make a great side for almost any meal that you would serve potatoes with. Thank you for posting this recipe. (Made for New Kids tag game)"
2001404169,524017,2017/2/24,5,Easy to make and delicious! We didn't have rum so we left that ingredient out of the recipe.
2001613266,516498,2017/7/4,0,I think this recipe makes much more than a pint of ice cream. There is well over a quart of ingredients in the recipe and I had to freeze it in two different batches. But yummy and lovely none the less!
266635,512458,2014/2/2,5,"Great tasting chili - definitely a winner in my book.  I love to try different styles of chili and we really enjoyed the addition of the corn and zucchini.  I added extra chili powder and I only used the chipotle chili sauce from the can vs. the chili itself.  Didn&#039;t have the espazote leaves, but I did use cilantro at the end.  Served with tortilla strips, Mexican cheese, and sour cream; although I liked it best with just the tortilla strips. Just hope it lasts through the Super Bowl game tonight. Will definitely make this recipe again : )."
266635,499878,2013/5/24,5,"This salad is absolutely delicious!  I used all organic fruits and added a little more cranberries and walnuts - just my preference.  The only change I made to the dressing was to add a tsp. of curry powder just to bump up the mayo and sour cream taste and I used a little lemon pepper.  Sooo worth the effort -- wonderful results!  Made for PRMR tag, May, 2013."
1802504364,499028,2014/2/18,5,"Your recipe looks very similar to the original Tortas de aceite from Spain. I&#039;ll try it. I recommend putting them in the oven about 40 seconds, cut with a long knife and serve with ice cream. Delicious! &lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing."
348934,505297,2015/10/3,3,I so wanted to really love this recipe.  The sauces were wonderful but the waffle itself just didn&#039;t work.  Followed the recipe as posted omitting soy sauce and curry powder (just seemed wrong for Falafel).  After several attempts on the waffle iron I gave up and cooked the batter in a fry pan like a pancake.  The flavor was good but something was wrong with the consistency of the batter at least for use on my waffle iron.    I made breakfast waffles this morning and they came off without a hitch.
2001544633,531520,2017/5/19,5,Yummmy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
461834,496599,2013/3/22,5,"Absolutely killer pancakes!!!  These are so quick and easy to get together in the morning, yet so much better then restaurant pancakes!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe and made as written except when it came to the instructions, it said to add oil and there wasn&#039;t any oil in the ingredients.  I just guessed and added 1 tablespoon oil for 1/2 of the recipe.  Served mine topped with fresh sliced strawberries and whipped topping, yummy!!!!  Thanks again Shrek for another great recipe.  Made for Spring PAC 2013."
12467879,522240,2017/1/30,5,"This was fantastic! Easy, healthy and fast. Perfect as is. I added steamed yakisoba noodles to the kale (leftover from another dinner)."
2001871785,522240,2017/12/20,5,"My family loved it! I wish I'd started with more than 5 cups of kale for bigger portions per person after shrinking, but otherwise absolutely fantastic"
340141,503711,2013/8/4,4,I had to make this pretty bland because my husband doesn&#039;t like spicy food and the jerk seasoning I picked up definitely had a bite to it.   It was very easy and fast to make.  ZWT9
2001887149,512402,2017/12/24,1,"Tried this recipe last night. Doubled it to make two 8x8 pans. Did all my math and measurements correctly. When they first came out of the oven, they looked about right. Then, I followed the directions to put them in my fridge to store them... yeah, no, bad idea. They are now dried up, hard as rocks, and the few places where they are soft they have the texture of Play-Doh. They were only in there overnight for my Xmas eve party today. Bottom line: huge waste of time and money. I'm not happy with this recipe at all."
6651,497651,2013/6/1,5,"Wow, fabulous!  I&#039;m already planning to make this recipe again next week."
310953,497651,2013/6/6,5,"Made this last nite for myself and ate the whole thing!  I had an eggplant asking to be used.. but couldn&#039;t get fired up for the whole parmigian deal nor did I have everything to make a ratatoulli..This came across my screen at just the right time.. Fresh herb planter is growing well...Some ricotta in the fridge to put on the side.... Used some seasoned feta in oil...sprinkled the tops with some mixed italian cheeses.. Yum.. I think it would be a good addition to an evening of Italian appetizers..bruchetta, vodka soaked cherry tomatoes..mini mac and cheese &quot;muffins&quot; and an antipasta salad..."
2000276193,497651,2015/6/17,1,"Recipe looks great, but neglects to give the appropriate baking temperature.  Probably 350 degrees?"
107583,494123,2013/2/9,5,"WOW!  What a taste treat.  And fairly simple to put together.  Since it is winter, I used the Foreman grill, but looking forward to doing this over flame on the BBQ for added smokiness.  We are trying to have at least one meatless dinner a week, and since I am not a big vegie fan, it is sometimes a challenge, but this will go into the rotation for sure.  Thanks for posting!"
686117,516652,2017/6/17,0,I have made this recipe a dozen times now and have loved it each time!
101432,519111,2016/1/12,5,"This a great pierogie dough, pure and simple. It was easy to work with and complemented my potato and cheese filling perfectly. Thanks for posting!"
254614,510510,2013/12/10,5,"This was delicious! I used large whole button crimini mushrooms, thinly sliced and vadalia &lt;br/&gt;sweet  onions. I use Sysco Chicken base. It is strong tasting and a little goes a long way but&lt;br/&gt;it does not have a lot of sodium. To reheat any leftovers, microwave on half power so the creamy sauce does not curdle."
2001145478,519838,2016/8/28,5,I made this without the chocolate chips and made it as mini muffins. Excellent paleo breakfast or treat!
77458,502671,2013/11/21,5,I just recently started canning different chutney recipes using fruit. Cranberries are one of my favorites and I really enjoyed this particular recipe. I&#039;m sure I will be making it again soon. Thanks for posting!
482376,536990,2018/9/26,5,This fit the bill perfectly on a busy day/night. It was so nice to come home to a nice smelling house. The chicken was very flavorful and the bok choy addition was very nice. Thank you!
2001423712,499363,2017/3/8,0,"I really like this dressing for its commonly available ingredients and the easy instructions. As a 71 year old grandma, I also usually add chopped apples and whatever fruit I have to the mixture. The fruits don't turn brown with the vinegar in the dressing. A definite keeper!"
169430,501317,2014/1/14,5,Purely wonderful. I was was a good bit more generous with the steak spice which I pressed into each side on the steak. Had to use the broiler as there is a foot of snow outside but that worked fine. I had an excellent steak about half way between rare and med and it tasted marvelous. A baked potato and green beans completed a meal that tasted like summer.
383346,497653,2013/4/25,5,That&#039;s so easy to do.  We liked the taste of garlic and lemon juice with the asparagus.  Thanks AmyZoe :)  Made for Holiday tag game
2002346708,515993,2018/11/23,5,"We made these at 8,300ft and they turned out great! They leavened perfectly and were very moist. Love that they don’t have nuts so my son can take them to school. I only used half of the crumble topping to cut the sugar a bit and I doubled the spices in the batter because I really enjoy tasting the spices."
1976893,495477,2013/4/8,4,"Delicious recipe, and just like Costco&#039;s Mac &amp; Cheese, though the kids found it a bit more &#039;oily&#039; so next time we&#039;ll try 1/3 less butter -- the cheeses are plenty rich by themselves. Very good Mac &amp; Cheese, and of course you could add cooked chicken or shrimp or lobster if you&#039;d like to make this an entree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. We had buttermilk on hand instead of heavy cream, and only about 1/2 as much as the recipe said to use. Followed my wife&#039;s suggestion to use equal parts of buttermilk and 2% milk, and it worked great (and probably quite a bit healthier).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Costco carries the Pecorino Romano cheese. I got the smallest wedge I could find, 1.35 lbs, and we still only used about 1/4 of that (so 1/4 to 1/3 lb.), so if you don&#039;t have a use for additional Romano cheese, might be better to buy this at a regular grocery store in smaller quantity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. We used Dubliner cheese instead of Parmesan cheese. Dubliner is very much like Parmesan though it bit more moist of a cheese. You can find it at Costco (about $8 for 3&quot;x3&quot;x8&quot; block) or at Trader Joe&#039;s for four times the cost per volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. We used Kirkland&#039;s pre-shredded Cheddar Jack cheese instead of the Cheddar Cheese. We keep this on hand for so many recipe&#039;s by freezing in quart bags (always tastes fresh when defrosted, couple mins on High in the microwave).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. For quick work on shredding these cheeses, I suggest you get yourself a restaurant style cheese grater (look on Crate &amp; Barrel like this link, http://reviews.crateandbarrel.com/7258/27128/restaurant-cheese-grater-reviews/reviews.htm, or any other site), and put your 1 cup measure in a large mixing bowl while grating the cheese so there&#039;s none spilled on the counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. The guys at Whole Foods (a high end grocery store) said be sure to use Durum Wheat semolina pasta, apparently it&#039;s higher quality &amp; healthier. Although online sites say it may be not as white colored, the kids just confirmed it&#039;s the regular color of pasta (and be sure they&#039;ll tell me if otherwise!), as you can see in the picture. Also we mixed elbow pasta and cavatappi, so if you do the same, start cooking the cavatappi about 3 minutes before adding the elbow pasta, because the cavatappi takes longer (10 mins) compared to the elbow (5-7 mins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&#039;s it!  Enjoy!"
2002359509,537351,2018/12/17,0,"Made this today. It was delicious! I recommend using only one packet of the onion soup mix, well distributed over the chicken. There should still be plenty of flavor."
2001536892,502802,2017/5/14,0,Does the chicken have to be from Thailand?
1802548788,495477,2014/3/3,2,"I didn&#039;t think it was just like Costco&#039;s actually. I cut the butter in 1/4 (I only used 1/4 cup, 1 cup of butter and 3 cups of cheese seemed a bit much to me). Even with that much less butter, it was so oily and separated. It can&#039;t be the same recipe as Costco because theirs is served cold and reheated and doesn&#039;t separate the way this does. I didn&#039;t love it. Sorry! I wanted to! Costco&#039;s mac and cheese is the best!"
2000155127,495477,2015/4/21,0,"Awesome!  The results from both my husband and me were &#039;thumps up.&#039;  It was tempting to alter the recipe on the &#039;Pecorino&#039; romano because it was more expensive, but wanted to give the recipe a chance.  I also purchased a better parmesan block.  I only needed half of both blocks - so I froze both leftovers, which I&#039;ll use for the next batch.  I did use Kirkland&#039;s &quot;Sharp&quot; Cheddar, which I might suggest, but it you want to use a white cheddar - it will &#039;look&#039; like the real Costco Mac&#039; Cheese.  I highly recommend this recipe.  PS - Use the Cavatappi pasta - not the smaller &#039;elbow&#039; macaroni and boil the minimum 8 minutes for al dente."
2001997377,495477,2018/2/18,2,"Followed the recipe to a T and though it was a delicious Mac and cheese it wasn’t close in comparison to the Costco Mac &amp; cheese. The flavor was good but I wouldn’t say the same and the consistency wasn’t close. Delicious dish, but not a copy cat."
2000431901,492754,2017/4/26,5,SO stunning! We had an unbirthday party and did a little photoshoot with the kids devouring their cake. It was super fun. Taking the rest to a get together tomorrow night.
128473,493292,2013/4/13,5,"Delicious muffins Lazyme. They had a great flavor, were not sweet, with a light, tender texture and great crumb.  Hard to believe that so little coffee cream produced such a pronounced presence. Everyone really enjoyed these muffins which I served with bold coffee. I did garnish with a little icing sugar. Thank you for sharing this delicious treat. Made for PAC Spring Safari 2013."
1706426,493292,2013/5/6,5,"Yum, these were so good! I used cocoa instead of chopped chocolate. Also, I mixed the wet with the dry ingredients and let sit for 10 mn. so the flour could absorb the liquid. Thanks for posting a real keeper! Made for Name that Ingredient tag game"
1334806,493292,2013/8/9,5,"Yummy muffins!  Not too sweet, and the filling was delicious - I used instant espresso powder and cocoa.  I also sprinkled coarse sugar on top.  Made for ZWT9."
216999,493292,2013/8/31,4,"These were good muffins, but were a little on the dry side.  The filling is very good, but definitely needs more sugar than the recipe calls for.  Adjust to your own taste.  Per other reviewer&#039;s comments, these would be good with sugar sprinkled on the top.  Made for the Hot Pink Panthers on the Prowl for Family Picks for ZWT9."
494084,508609,2014/10/8,5,"Great recipe!  I&#039;m giving it 5 stars for ease, low cost, and relative health.  First time I made it just as written but without the tomatoes and it was quite good.  What I will say, though, is I will tweek it next time.  I think I&#039;ll double the tuna and olives and maybe add some other veggies because it was mostly pasta.  Otherwise, this was a recipe the whole family enjoyed!  Thanks MariaLuisa....."
1160514,508609,2014/12/16,5,"make a little sauce, add cream cheese and when your noodles are almost done add the tuna, not flaked chunk Genova is the best your only heating the tuna thru not cooking it,"
1052873,522851,2016/7/26,4,"This was tasty, but difficult to do. Lots of basting. I was trying to cook Yakitori at the same time. I think it might have been better if it cooked in foil with the sauce and maybe just a few minutes out of the foil to caramelize."
428885,501816,2014/4/13,5,"Wonderful, basic, but truly delish roast chicken recipe. Love the onions on the bottom of the pan, and the garlic and lemon inside the cavity. I covered the breast area the last 20 minutes of roasting. Thank you so much for your recipe! Made for PAC - 2014"
383346,504226,2014/8/5,5,Wonderful marinade.  I used it to marinate chicken breasts.  Thanks Annacia
2001286734,520097,2016/12/7,1,"This is not the Fannie Farmer recipe. The original recipe calls for 0.5 tsp of baking soda, not 2 tbsp of baking powder. Also, omit the milk."
185721,508209,2015/8/16,5,My husband and I both loved this pie.  It reminded me of a frozen chocolate cream pie that my mom used to buy for us when I was a kid.  I think the brand was Morton if I remember correctly and if not then possibly Banquet.  I used to love those pies.  It was great to have a low carb version of that pie.   My husband gave it 5.5 stars and that&#039;s the highest rating from him because he rarely rates anything above 4 stars.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.

1624566,507417,2013/12/6,5,"This soup is a real keeper. I had to modify it a little according to my ingredients but it&#039;s basically the same. I used fresh turnip greens. So I started in the pot with the sausage and onion. I let them brown slightly, then I added the diced greens to the pan and let them wilt a little. Then I added the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for 1/2 hr. It is colorful and tasty...we loved it.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks!"
2001203959,507417,2016/10/12,5,"Loved this soup. Followed the recipe and it was delicious but next time I will add another can of rotel, just personal preference. I made it for my 4 grandboys and they loved it We will make it often with cornbread muffins, of course."

2684378,494631,2013/2/10,5,I have eaten these and I am here to say these are so tasty and I recommend you make these or have them made.  Great appetizer! Enjoyed the savoriness and how the Hidden Valley Original Ranch Dip Mix seasonings and flavors brightened and enchanced three layers in this one!
2415510,494631,2013/2/10,5,"My family and I love to cook on the grill year round and this is going to be supper tonight ! Is anything better than grilled potatoes ? But then to add shrimp takes it to a whole new level of yum ! ...top it off with spinach Mousse and this is why I love you Nancy , you are so creative ! Keep em coming !"

1802697968,520826,2015/2/15,5,"I was looking for new chicken and cabbage recipes, thought this looked familiar, sure enough one of my friends had posted this recipe on Face Book, I printed it on December 7, 2013 and have made it several times since.  The only changes I made was to use minced garlic, minced ginger and low sodium soy sauce."
2000147912,520826,2015/5/6,5,"Made this today for lunch, my husband and I loved it. I did however add some red capsicum for some  colour and it looked and tasted delicious. Served it with some plain rice, it will now become a regular on our table."
2000075697,520826,2015/7/23,4,We added matchstick cut carrots to this recipe. Onion whites from green onions would have been good too. It was really yummy but I feel like it was slightly bland or missing something.
45554154,520826,2016/2/18,4,"I used to order this at our favorite Chinese Restaurant. When I came across this recipe, I was very excited. I&#039;ve tried it once and it was good, but the chicken seemed a little bland. I&#039;m making it again, but this time I&#039;m going to marinate the chicken in some Low Sodium Soy Sauce, ginger and garlic. Can&#039;t wait to try it."
2001324151,520826,2017/1/7,0,It came out so bland needs more spices
2001362661,520826,2017/1/22,0,Made it today I used more soy sauce and added brown sugar to make it sweet and spicy also I used noodles instead of rice
2001455940,520826,2017/3/26,0,"I added salt, pepper, little sesame oil, fresh mushrooms &amp; onions to mine."
2001519604,520826,2017/5/3,2,"Followed the recipe to a &quot;t&quot; and it was gross! I added a little more soy sauce, more cabbage, brown sugar and it was edible, but still not very good. Made fried rice to go with it. The rice was great, but ...... I don't think I'll be trying this again."
2001563564,520826,2017/5/31,0,After reading some of the reviews that stated the recipe was a little bland I added a little more garlic and ginger and then added a few red pepper flakes. It turned out amazing. Will definitely fix again.
2002281598,520826,2018/10/6,0,"Instead of vegetable or coconut oil, use sesame seed oil. Anything you add this into instantly gets that &quot;Chinese food&quot; taste. Just 1 -2 teaspoons is enough to flavor a whole dish."
2730147,496243,2013/3/10,0,Tried this delicious fast and easy recipe and enjoyed very much
2477638,505491,2013/9/7,5,"Seriously good! I wanted something simple, and this was just right. I didn&#039;t have Italian breadcrumbs, so I used panko and Italian seasoning, and it was great. Definitely use more than a teaspoon of salt, since it doesn&#039;t specify an amount, and I used to little, but sprinkled some on top while they were still a bit oily from baking, and it was fine. I put the slightest bit of olive oil on the pan, and turned once during cooking, which I definitely recommend. Will make this again."
1802918859,505491,2014/7/11,5,"Great, easy recipe!!  My son loved these and I added a bit of 6 cheese Italian shredded cheese.  Will definitely use this again!!"
7821918,505491,2014/12/14,4,This is the first recipe I saw that didn&#039;t require any milk. The meatballs are juicy but could use a little more seasoning.
1803755901,505491,2015/2/21,5,A very simple and delicious recipe. The perfect addition to our spaghetti dinner.  Will make them again.
2000161547,505491,2015/4/23,5,This is definitely one of the best meatball recipes I have tried in a while. Super delish!
2000149383,505491,2015/5/13,5,I can&#039;t cook but these turned out great! I didn&#039;t want that many so I cut the recipe in half and accidentally used a whole cup of bread crumbs so they were a little dry but they all got ate!! I&#039;ll definitely be making more! Thanks!!
623257,505491,2015/7/14,5,Great tasting recipe! Will definitely be using again!
2000448259,505491,2015/9/2,5,I made these for the first time tonight and my eldest daughter (9) came to me and whispered in my ear &quot;Don&#039;t tell Mom but yYour meatballs taste way better than her&#039;s&quot;.  Thank you for a great recipe that makes me look good.
2000506541,505491,2015/9/29,5,"Really simple and tasty meatballs. I wasn&#039;t disappointed.
I substituted the cup of parmesian for 1/2 cup of each: parmesian and Romano."
2000021603,505491,2016/1/26,4,"for something with a different flavor profile, cut the ground beef to 1 lbs. and add 1 lbs. of Italian sausage."
2001079190,505491,2016/7/7,5,These were great.
1052873,501334,2013/6/9,4,Made as written except used reconstituted dry shiitake mushrooms instead of fresh button because I didn&#039;t want to run to the store. They were too chewy. This was way too bland. Everybody put a lot of parmesan on top which made it a little better. I think it wouldl have benefited from garlic and ginger in the oil to cook the chicken and chicken broth for the asparagus or maybe soy sauce. Served with angel hair pasta.
251917,501334,2013/12/1,5,Aussie Swap #82: Delicious dinner - perfect for my entire family! I loved the mushrooms and asparagus with the chicken!
498271,501334,2014/4/12,4,"Great simple and tasty weeknight meal!  I was late getting dinner going and loved how quickly this came together.  I used boneless skinless breasts, otherwise made just as directed and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Served with whole wheat pasta and there was just enough &quot;broth&quot; to moisten the pasta.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2014"
212609,501595,2013/9/6,0,"My DH loves smoked salmon, and avocado, so I made this for his packed lunch.&lt;br/&gt;Instead of mountain bread I used a wrap, as he prefers them.&lt;br/&gt;He liked the combination of flavours, but wasn&#039;t a massive fan of the texture combination....but that&#039;s more to do with him than the recipe I suspect....hence why I haven&#039;t awarded any stars.&lt;br/&gt;Sorry Pat.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
143318,501595,2013/9/28,5,"Lovely combo of colors, textures, and flavors. Since I had the larger Florida-style avocado which is creamier, I skipped the mayo. This addicting avocado-dill-mustard spread would also make a good salad dressing. Love these and will make again!"
1900559,505491,2016/10/4,5,"Great and easy recipe. If you want to jazz them up, make a gravy from sauted onion, milk, coffee, and a bit of flour, a dash of nutmeg, salt and pepper. Then you have Swedish meatballs the way I was taught. : )"
2001921126,505491,2018/3/7,0,These meatballs were excellent.
2002098795,505491,2018/4/6,5,"These were my first attempt at making meatballs and they were super easy to make. They tasted great, and were not salty at all. Overall great recipe and great meatballs."
1663041,496717,2015/1/19,5,"This was very good, although I think I baked mine a few minutes too long.  My oven tends to run very hot, so I baked mine at 315 degrees for 70 minutes.  Next time I will remove it five minutes sooner.  This is a very sweet cake with a lovely texture.  I glazed mine, but next time will probably serve it plain."
169430,501812,2014/4/20,4,"Although I found it on the strong side for my house and added some sparkling water the taste, overall, was excellent. I used Splenda for the sugar. The raspberries were fun to munch when the lemonade was gone from the glass. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
128473,501812,2014/5/2,5,"Wow, was this good.  We loved your pink lemonade recipe. Delicious, bold flavors, quick and easy to make.  It doesn&#039;t get any better than this. The addition of the cranberry juice, lemon slices and raspberries really elevate the lemonade, adding even more fresh flavor.  Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that I will make again.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
2001335262,496989,2017/1/3,0,"this ingredient list is 100% incorrect for Nathan's onion recipe, though it may be good, it's definitely not a Nathan's onion sauce!!!!"
296809,503490,2013/7/16,4,"Made as written for ZWT-9 as part of a Cajun/Creole &amp; Greek appy-nite, DH &amp; I both enjoyed these tasty wings &amp; the sauce that accompanied them. I used homemade apricot marmalade that was a gift from a friend for the sauce &amp; it was a bit chunky, so it had flavor &amp; texture. I made a 2nd ZWT dipping sauce recipe as a taste test &amp; we liked them equally well. From a cook&#039;s view, I&#039;ll chg 1 part of the prep. I found the pastry brush process tedious &amp; will just add the wings to the &quot;paste&quot; &amp; mix well to coat them B4 placing them on the baking sheet. A word of advice to chefs who follow me (&amp; I hope there are many), do not skip using the aluminum foil. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
1213142,503490,2016/8/28,5,"Excellent recipe! I used this for thighs, which are larger, so I increased the oven temp to 350* and baked them on a suspended rack for approx 45 minutes. I had red beans &amp; rice as the perfect accompaniment. Thank you!"
2549237,507156,2013/10/17,5,"So, I cheated slightly, I used a premade Oreo Cookie Crumb Crust, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  It tastes sort of like a Reese&#039;s Peanut Butter Cups.  This will definitely be made again and again in our household. I took a photo, but am having a tech issue with my computer and need to get that fixed before I can upload it.  I made this recipe for Everyday Is A Holiday October 2013."
560491,507156,2013/10/28,5,This is really good!  I too cheated and used a chocolate graham cracker crust (DH got to my Oreos first).  I like that is it not too chocolatey or to peanut buttery.  I could have done without the peanuts (personal preference) but DH really liked the addition.  Made for PRMR.
57484,512262,2014/3/22,0,"I have Sandra Woodruff&#039;s Good Carb Cookbook, and I have made this many times. In fact I&#039;m making this for supper tonight. Good stuff!"
1802635898,514287,2014/4/1,5,Excellent!
1802638011,514287,2014/4/2,5,This recipe is so different from other hash brown recipes that i have tried. The pineapple and ham sounds so delicious i definateley have try it.
41761920,514287,2014/4/2,5,Sounds delicious! Gonna have to try it!
482376,507184,2014/5/5,4,"These were very good. I liked the extra veggies in the mixture. The only change I would make is to add more salt. We ended up salting it a bit at the table. Other than that, these were really yummy!  Made for  the 2014 Spring Pick A Chef event."
2399085,512460,2014/1/31,3,Made for PRMR. It really is different. I did not particularly like it. It did get eaten but won&#039;t make again. It just isn&#039;t our bowl of chili. A few changes to this could make this good though. Thanks.
2737598,496612,2013/3/15,5,Simple and tasty.  Being a bachelor I love to eat but not cook. This tastes like mom&#039;s and that&#039;s saying alot.
386585,507699,2013/12/17,5,"This could not be simpler or tastier!  I was intrigued by this recipe when I saw it, and had to try it.  Well, I&#039;ve been trying it ever since!  I make this quite frequently and it satisfies my mac &amp; cheese fix without going through a whole lot of trouble.  I&#039;ve added hot sauce, etc., and used different cheeses, as well.  Very versatile!  Thanks so much for sharing this keeper!  Made for Rookie Recipe Tag Game."
203111,507699,2013/12/18,2,"I&#039;m afraid I was disappointed in this recipe.  While the end result was just okay, the recipe has problems, I&#039;d say.  First off, the water needs salt.  Second, I actually had to microwave the macaroni a total of 12 minutes and used a total of 6 Tbls water.  Additionally, I had to increase the milk to 4 tsp.  I probably won&#039;t make this again since it didn&#039;t really save me any more time than the stovetop mac I usually make and just wasn&#039;t as good.  But thank you for posting this, anyway."
163112,514206,2014/3/31,5,Absolutely fantastic!  Made as directed.  The whole family loved it.  It&#039;s a nice change of pace for cabbage &amp; will make it again.  Made for Aussie Swap 3/14.
251917,514206,2014/3/31,5,Aussie Swap #86: Delicious!! My husband is from Germany and he is all about his red cabbage and this was 2 thumbs up from him! Made with our corned beef dinner - thank you for sharing!
2736381,497451,2013/3/14,5,Awesome.  Great flavor.  The addition of the coconut really adds to what typically is a simple side dish.  It makes it seem special with very little effort.  great recipe!
2765447,497451,2013/4/1,5,"Wow, the coconut really gives this recipe a wonderful twist....five stars to this new addition to my favorites."
2001047423,532797,2017/12/9,5,"I would not have thought of this had I not seen this. A great idea &amp; a 'budget-conscious' one thinking of Christmas Buffets &amp; New Year Parties ahead. Made at a friends house, she on the Aga with bacon &amp; me on the gas cooker with veggy bacon! I had to fry my veggy bacon on high heat briefly to crisp it but still leave it pliable. Mine were the best because friend ignored the last important bit about letting them settle - the bacon sticks more together in that time so it stays rigid &amp; doesn't let the filling collapse downwards. Macaroni Cheese was thought of as an 'old-person's' meal until Jamie Oliver revived it (a little) but I see it a lot on US websites. I say 'all power to the cheese'!! Some 'filled bacon nests' look like an open flower, some like an open jacket potato, but it's great to have this variant. I shall include them for my New Years Eve get-together (if I haven't eaten them all first)."
2001998850,532797,2018/2/18,0,For some reason I can not get any of the movies to play
2002001352,532797,2018/2/19,5,"Amazing, my boy loves mac and cheese and the wife loves bacon. I added some paprika to my mac and cheese, cause I like it that way. Even so, without I'm sure it would have been good."
2001996945,532797,2018/2/24,5,"15 minutes to cook the bacon at 450F so the bacon is cooked and still bendy. Butter in the bottom of the muffin and cupcake tins. Standard favourite family mac and cheese recipe. Easy, fast, and a crowd pleaser for the young adults at the table. Dad's cooking using Genius Kitchen recipes worked again! Jim in Canada"
2001755887,517672,2017/10/17,4,"This turned out great, however i yielded only 3 pints."
329769,503969,2013/7/21,4,Reviewed for ZWT9- wow! This was such a super quick recipe to prepare and cook. The Cajun flavours received mixed ratings from my family of taste-testers tonight. Photo also being posted
1206102,501847,2014/11/30,5,"What a hoot! Delicious. My mom would smear peanut butter on a sliced banana, dab some mayonnaise on top, and I LOVED IT! Crunchy peanuts on top would gild the lily!"
1072593,501847,2015/3/20,5,This is a new one on me. Look here:  8-)  That&#039;s my surprise face. The kid&#039;s loved &#039;em.
305531,522881,2015/8/9,5,"I realize that ebi means shrimp..........but I didn&#039;t have any and I did have some smoked salmon. I was dying to try this recipe, so went for it. I&#039;ve usually made rolled sushi before, so this was fun to try it this way. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Stacy. Hope it was ok that I subbed the salmon. Made for Culinary Quest 2015."
2000728555,524955,2015/12/5,5,This recipe looks and sounds delicious! Quick and easy. Just the right spice. We can&#039;t wait to try this recipe.
2000728451,524955,2015/12/4,5,Awesome taste. simple and quick recipe. Outstanding meal for my family.
2000729395,524955,2015/12/5,5,"I just made these for a lunch-time get together with a couple of friends. This recipe is wonderful. Simple, easy and a fabulous taste. The spices blend well together and the little bit of heat from the diced jalapenos really kicks it up a notch. And what&#039;s not to love about using goat cheese in any recipe!! The taste is amazing and everyone loved them. Glad I gave this recipe a try.......definitely a keeper!!"
1052873,503993,2013/7/18,5,"These were really good. It&#039;s not strawberry season and I had a lot of blueberries so I used blueberries instead, lightly mashed. I didn&#039;t read the note about tomatoes until after I made them or I would have tried tomatoes. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The dough is really thick and they don&#039;t rise much. I made 18 and the cups were very full but they came out just right. Made for ZWT 9 - Greece"
39835,503993,2013/7/24,5,"Wonderful muffins - made as directed except I used splenda for the sugar and only almond extract. I also used all regular flour - white and wholewheat. I made 24 muffins - had six for dinner and froze 12, and figure the rest will be gone by breakfast.These went fast! Thanks for sharing!"
169430,503993,2013/9/16,5,"Photo may be seen here in the Savor gallery: www.annacia.com .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So good!. I reduced the recipe to 8 muffins and made 5 big ones out of the amount I had. Used Splenda Brown and regular flours. These taste simply wonderful, sweet but not overly so. I didn&#039;t exactly measure the strawberries so I likely used a bit more than ask for but if so it sure didn&#039;t hurt anything :D. Even my very over sized muffins were fully baked at 18 mins so keep an eye out if making the standard size. Tender, moist and full of great flavor...how can you go wrong?"
163112,505077,2013/8/10,5,"OOH I get to be first!  This is wonderful, CG!  One quick mention - my package actually says farro.  Looked it up &amp; it&#039;s all basically the same thing.  I *did* remember to soak them overnight.  They were cooked in closer to 30 minutes.  Once the spices had steeped &amp; the flavorings added (I would double the orange flower water next time; it was wayyyy too subtle), I added the wheat berries back to soak in the flavorful milk until the rest of the gang woke up.  I added more honey to my serving.  So delicious &amp; the chewiness of wheat berries makes me weak in the knees.  Thank you!  Made for Ramadan Tag 2013."
383346,496412,2013/4/9,5,This banana bread is so yummy.  My son loved it for his snacks at school.  Thanks :)  Made for PAC Spring 2013
2001284557,535555,2018/6/19,5,"I made this for the crew and it was great! I used a sweet onion, just a personal preference. But it works as is, will use again!"
1686076,535555,2018/8/17,4,"Turned out pretty well and was easy (relatively) to do considering I was kind of disabled and didn't,have all of the ingredients. I followed as close as I could and the results were quite tasty. I will use this again and do it right to see the difference but this one is a keeper."
2736860,496709,2013/3/14,5,"I love Philly Cheese Steak and potatoes, so mixing them together makes a great meal for me."
461834,492841,2013/6/1,5,"OMG!!!  Just outstanding!!  This went straight into my Best of 2013 Cookbook.  I made this as written, using a little less then a pound of skirt steak and the only other change I made was to sub ground ginger (1/8 tsp) for the fresh.  The bottom of the ingredients included vegetable oil, salt and pepper but was included in the directions.  I went and looked at the food network site and it wasn&#039;t included there either, so I just guessed and brushed the remainder of the scallions with the oil and seasoned with salt and pepper and grilled them with the meat.  This is so flavorful and so easy to pull together!  Served it with some rice and corn on the cob.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for &quot;Name that Ingredient Tag Game&quot;."
724631,492841,2014/2/26,5,"Amazing marinade!  Because skirt steak is overpriced if not hard to find, I used venison tenderloin from the hunter&#039;s freezer.  Of course, I relied on my Thermapen to tell when it was done.  I put the vegetable oil on a 2nd plate, sprinkled it with salt and pepper and rolled the green onion stalks to coat. Thank you for updating the ingredients listing; for the marinade, you want us to mince the white part of the scallions. Made for Best of 2013 tag, based on the recommendation of diner524."
311525,511837,2014/2/13,4,These were a great alternative to carb-loaded regular pancakes. We are trying to limit our white sugar/processed foods and this recipe was perfect. I used Bob&#039;s Red Mill brand Almond Meal instead of Trader Joe&#039;s. I prefer TJ&#039;s brand is a better substitute for breadcrumbs (i.e. chicken cutlets) due to it&#039;s consistency. I used half a banana and found that making them small (like silver dollar pancakes) and fairly thin was helpful in ensuring they cooked all the way through. My picky 2.5 year olds ate them up!
165933,512717,2014/1/31,5,"Made this tonight for dinner, the soup has not even hit the table yet and I&#039;m in love!  I roasted the veggies on one cookie sheet to save time and space in the oven.  Keeping the mushrooms on one side and the onion/garlic on the other side of the sheet.  I&#039;m not lazy but this only gave me one cookie sheet to wash (guess I am lazy)!  I placed everything in a deep pot and used my stick blender which left little bits of the solids.  I think I&#039;ll see how this freezes if there are any leftovers!  DH will complain, no meat, so sad.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe."
526666,505534,2013/8/13,5,"Loved it! What a creative idea - pastry in a milkshake! I made these for dessert, for my MIL&#039;s birthday dinner and everyone scarfed them down! Great recipe, Chef Jean! Thanks for sharing!"
67728,505534,2013/9/7,5,"Sorry, Jean, I made these when you first posted the recipe, but I forgot to go back and post my review! Well, here it is now, lol. This was delicious! I didn&#039;t have any vanilla ice cream, so I just used coffee ice cream instead. I also couldn&#039;t find any glazed donuts at the grocery store I was shopping in, but they did have some glazed yeast donut holes, so I used those instead (with the ratio of 4 donut holes = 1 donut). I must admit, I tried this for breakfast -- hey, it&#039;s coffee and donuts, why not? Nice job on the team recipe, Jean! Thanks for posting it! Made by a fellow Hot Pink Panther on the Prowl during ZWT9"
107583,511078,2014/4/18,5,Delicious!  And easy.  These went great with a steak and looking forward to trying them on a burger.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC.
266635,504277,2014/2/11,4,"Very flavorful and tasty grilled chicken.  I did cut back on the caraway seed and red pepper some and the outcome was just fine for our tastes.  Since the recipe calls for boneless, skinless breasts, I would suggest adding a little olive oil to the spices to add some moisture and to prevent the chicken from drying out.  Next time, I might try chicken thighs instead.  This chicken made for a really nice meal.  Made for PRMR, February, 2014."
486725,504277,2015/5/4,4,"Really good chicken. I just sprinkled on the spices, didn&#039;t measure, so might have been less than called for. You could definitely still taste the caraway and the red pepper made it quite spicy. I drizzled a teeny bit of good olive oil on these after cooking and it was great on it. Was part of a wonderful meal tonight."
47892,504277,2016/6/27,5,"I dumped all the ingredients in a clean spice mill. Super easy! Sprinkled on local free range chicken thighs (which I recommend over breasts), drizzled with olive oil and pan grilled (the day this was served turned out to be a not-so-great day for outdoor grilling due to rain unfortunately). This can also be prepared as a wet rub by adding the mixture to oil and using a pastry brush. Accompanied by basic couscous and roasted whole carrots from the farmers' market. Loved the caraway in this mix!"
227978,504277,2016/10/14,5,"This was delicious. At first, it was a little to spicy for my tastes, but I hung in there and appreciated it more as I finished. The spice mix really made the chicken delicious. We're experiencing stormy weather in the PNW right now, so I couldn't grill it but instead broiled it. I hope that's OK. It sure turned out delicious, and I can imagine it's even better on the grill. Thanks, LifeIsGood. I'm glad I tried this recipe."
2001861348,520341,2017/12/16,4,"I’ll definitely use this as a base in the future. No time for saut&eacute;ing mentioned. I just saut&eacute;ed onions for a minute, added ginger for 30 seconds and then added the coconut aminos. I only had 2 chicken breasts, so cut the recipe in half. Going forward, I will definitely use double the amount of onion and coconut aminos. After 10 minutes, I flipped the chicken breasts over. After a total of 25 minutes, I removed the chicken breasts, added 4 cups baby spinach, covered and wilted it for 1 minute. Going forward, I will use at least 6 cups of spinach for 2 breasts since I am wilting it. My husband claimed this was very tasty and he would like some rice on the side."
1800102456,507416,2013/10/6,5,I absolutely enjoyed making this simple dish! My whole family loved it and it is guaranteed that I am going to make it again!
1803044868,502248,2014/8/18,5,I give this 5 stars. It is easy to make. Tastes great and is a very healthy meal. I make two meals out of mine because they are so big. I can&#039;t eat that much in one sitting.
1072593,522186,2016/11/29,5,Lately I've been making all types of Vietnamese dishes. I feel I likely know just about everything that's important to know...cilantro is the topping of choice and the amount of jalapeno will make one cry.
29196,497159,2013/4/18,5,"I always think cucumbers, yoghurt and dill were meant to be together, and salmon loves them all too! This was super yummy thank you."
380644,510953,2013/12/28,5,"Absolutely the best!  Well worth all the extra &quot;love&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Since my stone was small, I had to bake each loaf separately - so I held the unbaked loaf in the refrigerator while the first baked.  Took it out while I bumped the heat back to 500 degrees.  Worked beautifully.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing a great recipe!"
2412137,493882,2017/1/14,4,"This turned out pretty well. Bad thing about making breakfast casseroles in the slow cooker is the cheese on top gets dark and you miss that cheese flavor. Out of all the breakfast casseroles I've made this turned out the best. I was apprehensive putting raw meat in with eggs and everything because thats a lot of grease sitting in there. So, I went ahead and cooked my sausage and then put everything together, I didnt have onion or peppers on hand but will add next time. This was a last minute deal. Thanks for the recipe."
305531,508008,2013/11/7,5,Really nice scramble. I didn&#039;t have any ham so used a thick sliced bacon instead. Otherwise I made as directed. Simple and very tasty. Thanks breezermom for sharing and congrats on your football win!
461834,508008,2013/11/14,5,"Wonderful scrambled eggs!!!  My sister was in town visiting, so I made these along with some homemade recipe#98849 and melon for a fantastic brunch.  I, also substituted bacon for the ham and did add a bit of sliced green onions.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and congrats on your win in the football pool!!!"
227978,508008,2013/11/21,5,"So tasty, breezermom.   Such a great combination of ingredients.  The tomatoes add a refreshing touch and the green pepper was a perfect balance.  But actually all the flavors blended quite well together and resulted in a wonderful breakfast dish.  Made for Week 11 of the Football Pool 2013."
386585,508008,2013/12/17,5,"I made this exactly as posted, using tomatoes, peppers and parsley straight from the farm.  This lends itself to many variations, but it is delicious as posted!  Made for breezermom&#039;s Football Pool Week #9 win!"
169430,508008,2014/3/8,5,"Scrumptious. Perfect Sat morning breakfast. Made by the recipe and we couldn&#039;t have enjoyed it more. I just served the eggs with toasted multigrain bread, apricot jam and coffee. What a good morning. :D"
286566,508008,2014/5/20,5,"I scaled back for 2 serves and the only change I made was to use a red capsicum/bell pepper instead of green and the DM and I thoroughly enjoyed our delicious and filling breakfast with a piece of wholemeal/wholegrain toast, thank you breezermom, made for Everyday is a Holiday tag game."
679953,508008,2015/1/24,5,"A real nice breakfast earlier in the week.   The combo of the green peppers, and tomato made for a real nice colorful, and very presentable dish.   The ham was an extra bonus.  Served with some English muffins and orange juice.  Made for FYC Tag,  Definitely recommended.."
242766,508008,2017/12/27,5,"We really enjoyed these delicious, flavorful eggs. I added a few extra tablespoons of milk to extend the recipe to feed a few more people. Also, I chopped up a couple of mushrooms and cooked them with the ham before adding the egg mixture. These eggs were a big hit with my guests. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. **Made for 2017 Football Pool**"
542159,501868,2014/4/5,4,"We enjoyed how healthy this salad was and thought the avocado brought a wonderful creaminess, but the toasted pumpkin seeds could not hold their own against the Brussels sprouts. Separating the Brussels sprout leaves was kind of a pain and am wondering if shaved Brussels sprouts could be used as they would be a lot quicker and easier.  Thanks for the post."
906261,502164,2013/9/27,3,Easy enough recipes but the sauce I made was too thick and cloudy as there is no given amount for the cornstarch and my guesstimate was too much. Tastes nice enough. I put a little fresh green chilli in to brighten the colour and add visual interest.
204024,493706,2013/4/10,4,This was really easy to make a chocolate snack.   It wasn&#039;t quite sweet enough so I added a little more sugar the second time I made it.  Also both times it cooked for 1 minute in microwave. Made for PAC Spring 2013.
179133,493706,2013/4/11,4,"A week or two ago I made a quick microwave cookie and it got me wondering if you could do something similar for a brownie. Turns out you can! :) I&#039;ve made this twice now, once with a super dark cocoa and once with regular Hershey&#039;s cocoa. The dark cocoa needed a tiny bit more sugar but both were good. I used oil both times but also want to try with butter to see if there is a noticeable difference. I used a cereal bowl and 30 seconds was perfect in my microwave. Thanks for sharing! [Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef]"
632249,493706,2013/4/18,5,This was a real surprise! I ate it while it was still warm and it was so fudgey and good.  I used the butter option and it was done in 30 seconds in my micro.  This is going to be a major hit with the kids! Thanks for the great little recipe. Made for Spring PAC 2013.
383346,493706,2013/10/21,5,This is so easy to do.  This is perfect for when we want something sweet because it can be done in a minute.  Thanks Lexeh :)  Made for Cooking tag mania
1706426,505576,2013/8/19,4,"We liked this, but I found it a bit too salty. The lemon was sooo good in it though! The combination of the lemon and olives was great, but I am very sensitive to salt, so that is why I gave it four. Made for ZWT9"
599450,505576,2013/8/26,5,"Delicious! Made as directed. The chicken came out so succulent and tender and just fell off the bone. I added the optional potatoes which gave this a very comfort-food quality. For the preserved lemons I used recipe #295914 and served on a bed of recipe #427438. I just LOVE the intro to the recipe and may borrow from it heavily for the Tagine Challenge! Thanks, Tisme! Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
1925885,505576,2013/9/3,5,"This was a good tagine, but I was not overwhelmed. The rest of the family loved it, in spite of my reservations in serving it because they are not all that adventurous in their food choices. So for that reason I will rate it a five.  Served this with Recipe#170334, but in the future will serve with something more mellow, like white rice - as I thought it was too much lemon.  Oh, and used yummy homemade Recipe#438353.  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT9 - team Gourmet Goddesses."
305531,510717,2014/11/21,5,I love to stuff potatoes with different fillings and this was a nice one. I sauteed the breast for a few minutes and used a hickory barbecue sauce. I didn&#039;t use any olives this time only because i was out of them Thanks Doug for a nice meal that we enjoyed. Made for For Your Consideration tag.
1331661,495089,2013/4/17,5,sauce was really good but if you add some red pepper flakes it kicks it up a notch. I rate this as excellent.
2666001,494325,2013/1/29,5,We just made this dish and it is so yummy and very easy. Great for superbowl sunday
2667080,494325,2013/1/30,5,"Looks wonderful, I can't wait to try!"
2681208,494325,2013/2/6,5,Delicious!!!
2683107,494325,2013/2/8,5,Sounds yummy - can't wait to try it.
2688787,494325,2013/2/11,5,"Sounds sooo good, I'm going to make this."
2700429,494325,2013/2/18,5,This dish is great!
418718,494972,2013/2/15,5,"sounds really,really good!!! yummmmyyy!!!!"
2200921,494972,2013/2/18,0,yum yum u believe i'm going to make this!
1112848,494972,2013/2/18,5,Terrific! Great combo of ingredients
2209000,494972,2013/2/18,5,Delicious!
2190033,494972,2013/2/19,5,Clever idea!
128473,502632,2014/5/5,5,"This was a really lovely sandwich.  It was full of flavor, had excellent textures and was quick and easy to make.  I used a nice fresh Italian Bread, butter, cheddar, bacon and spicy cilantro lime mayonnaise, so good.  I will be enjoying this again, next time I will add a slice of tomato as well, I think it would really compliment the sandwich. Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
2423302,494972,2013/2/20,5,Outstanding :) Great flavor Combo!!! Delicious!!!
2415384,494972,2013/2/20,5,yum!
2210843,494972,2013/2/20,5,Love it!
1802894338,517213,2014/7/24,5,I love tacos like this. Reminds me of taco bell hard shell tacos
126440,497715,2013/3/19,5,Great fries!  Loved all the flavors on them.  Mine weren&#039;t crisp but nicely roasted.
482376,497715,2014/4/8,5,This is a great sweet potato fry recipe. We really liked the spice combination. Our fries turned out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Thank you! Made for the Spring 2014 Pick A Chef event.
930552,497715,2014/5/1,5,"These are delicious! Definitely the best sweet potato fries I have ever made, and my husband agrees! I lined my pan with aluminum foil, and it worked just fine. The cayenne is delicious, but it makes it quite spicy! I flipped the potatoes when they were half way through the cooking time to make sure they were extra crispy. Thank you for sharing this will be my go to recipe for sweet potato fries from now on!"
1800358167,497715,2014/8/27,5,Loved these the seasonings was the perfect cajun sweetness
1802849661,497715,2015/1/8,5,"These were LIFE CHANGING! I never thought I liked sweet potato, but these were divine. So much so that we had them twice in 3 days! The seasoning along with the crunchy, but soft potato was just wonderful!"
2376798,497715,2015/2/9,4,"Great flavor. Just hoped for a little crispiness,"
1072593,497715,2015/3/23,5,"OMG I ate wayyyy toooo much. I obviously have a double personality disorder
and the  &#039;other me&#039;  has no self control."
1283006,497715,2015/6/17,5,excellent!
2000348357,497715,2015/7/19,5,"Amazing flavor! I made mine with coconut oil so they were slightly sweeter and I think that&#039;s the reason mine didn&#039;t get crispy. But I didn&#039;t care! They were amazing. The whole pan was gone and my company thought they were the best sweet potato fries they ever had. 

I didn&#039;t have smoked paprika on hand so I just used regular. I can&#039;t wait to try them with smoked paprika."
2000144740,497715,2015/8/24,5,My husband and I love these sweet potato fries! We only use this recipe to make them!:)
2000318877,497715,2015/9/1,4,Excellent recipe! Amazing flavor!highly recommend it.
2000466194,497715,2015/9/10,5,So so good! The ideal bake temp &amp; time for me was 400 F for 25 minutes. Also added a teaspoon of Italian Seasoning to the spice blend. Amazing!
2000682556,497715,2015/11/16,0,"Made an addition to the recipe.  After baking per the recipe, I deep fried them for 3 minutes at 375degrees.   That added some crispness and additional flavor.   Great recipe."
2000684016,497715,2015/11/16,5,My favorite recipe for spicy sweet potatoes!
672534,497715,2016/4/18,3,"The spices were nice, but somewhat salty (I used kosher salt.)  However, my &quot;fries&quot; were pretty limp.  I baked them a bit longer than called for to try to get them crispy, but that didn&#039;t work.  Next time, I&#039;ll try this with russet potatoes."
2001023072,497715,2016/10/16,1,"Didn't like them at all...not me and not my husband. Do not use this recipe, they are too salty"
2001215166,497715,2016/10/21,4,"Really tasty sweet potato oven fries. Will make again. PRO TIP, you MUST roast these on your bottom oven rack to get them crispy."
2000149100,497715,2017/2/13,2,"This was a fail for us. As mentioned , if you are a moderate salt eater, you will have to decrease the salt somewhat . All in all, the collection of spices are too strong, completely obliterating the 'sweet potato' taste. I suppose a light coating would have helped.. As well, they turned out limp."
39835,500960,2013/7/6,5,These are great -- a winner in my house! Made as directed with the exception of skipping the thyme. Thanks for sharing!
527607,500960,2015/8/29,5,"Super good tacos, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the sauce complemented them beautifully"
126440,515640,2014/4/30,5,Great dressing to go on our salad.  Very easy and turned out nice and thick.  Was out of sour cream so used yogurt and a squeeze of lemon.
286566,513448,2014/3/2,5,"I made these for the DM as a birthday treat dessert.  I only ended up making 9 as that was as many as I could fit on my tray and I was running short of time.  The only change I made which takes away the skinny girl aspect was to use melted butter (brushing it on) instead of spray oil as my oil was not spraying as a fine mist but in clumps otherwise made as per recipe and they were beautifully crisp and oh so good, thank you ForeverMama, made for Photo Tag tag game."
285039,499425,2013/5/16,5,This is a quick and easy meal for busy week nights.  The only change I made was to grill the salmon and toss it in with the noodles just before serving.   My whole family enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again!
2001105661,513369,2016/7/28,4,"Great recipe! I didn't have the creamed corn, but added a handful of green onions and the flavor was awesome. Sweet and moist with a pop of onions and cheese. I did only bake it for 20 minutes. It's better to start a shorter timer and add time as necessary until it's golden."
251917,509789,2013/12/1,5,Aussie Swap #82: These potatoes were divine!! Easy to prepare and a good accompaniment with any meal!!
496803,504821,2013/8/2,4,"Gotta love it when you can make a nice cocktail from ingredients you have on hand.  I&#039;m actually enjoying this heated instead of iced, since my honey wasn&#039;t really runny enough to stir into the rum.  Kind of like drinking a hot toddy, but the rum gives it a completely different flavor.  Although I think I prefer rum with lime to rum with lemon; this is good, and I&#039;d certainly not turn it down if offered again.  Made for ZWT9"
1179225,504821,2013/8/20,4,"Really good, but too sweet for me. I halved the honey and it was still too sweet. I&#039;ll try it again using only a half T. of honey. Love the simplicity and sweet/tart thing going on.Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1052873,504821,2016/8/6,4,Tasty but too sweet. Also the ice made the honey thicken.
212609,508542,2013/11/13,5,Simple ingredients that marry together perfectly to create absolute deliciousness...you just can&#039;t beat it!!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR.
695933,508542,2013/11/16,5,"This sandwich was very tasty! flavor into the grilled cheese and I loved the turkey. I used marble jack cheese, out of personal preference, and it was a scrumptious lunch! Thank you!....PRMR 2013.....Grpa"
1783373,509789,2014/3/11,5,"This potato dish is one that I&#039;ll be making over and over again.  It was well enjoyed by all in the family.  I didn&#039;t use lemon thyme as it&#039;s nowhere to be found around here unless you grow it yourself.  I used regular thyme and grated lemon rind which worked out very well, though I&#039;m curious on how lemon thyme would have tasted.  Made it for Everyday is a Holiday tag game.  Thank you I&#039;mPat for another great recipe."
128473,509789,2017/7/17,5,"We loved this recipe. The potatoes were perfection. Crisp, crunchy and tender on the inside. They were a lovely golden brown. I didn't use fresh rosemary or thyme as I was out. I subbed with ground rosemary and dried thyme, they worked great in this recipe. Thank you for sharing another lovely recipe Pat. Made for Went to Market Tag game."
2700822,495757,2013/2/19,5,"Made this last night after seeing it posted. Was really impressed, it was fast and easy and it tasted amazing, like it came from a four star restaurant. My family was really happy and loved it."
461834,505610,2013/8/19,4,"Nice wings which were part of our dinner appetizers last night!!  I had 6 frozen wings and had plan to make these for my lunch, but ended up meeting DS and his girlfriend for lunch, so these were then added to our dinner appetizers, lol!!  They ended up marinading for over 24 hours due to the change in plans.  We all liked the wings but felt they were bland and missing something, maybe some ginger, oyster sauce or sesame oil would have given them more flavor.  Something I would try again but tweak it a bit!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
169430,501222,2013/6/22,5,We sometimes enjoy breakfast for dinner and I have to say that this recipe is a keeper. Even DH dove in and cleaned his plate with a smile. Had to use red spud&#039;s as they were the only kind in the house and I think that they held up better in the cooking than russets would have. The bacon hash was delish and the poached eggs really enjoyed. We love poached eggs but for some reason I seldom make them. I sprinkled a pinch of salt on the eggs and chopped chives over the plates and dinner was served.
2818405,499993,2013/5/8,4,"i love succotash and not had any in so long, now i&#039;m happy to have this recipe, and add it to my cookbook"
2597942,505748,2013/8/25,5,I made a batch of this (just thinking that it was too easy to be any good). What a surprise. I used it on chicken and it was really good (and I don&#039;t usually like coriander). Hubby and our neighbor both devoured almost the entire bird (I got a leg). Will definitely make another batch to keep in the spice cabinet. Thank you for posting. (Made for ZWT9)
163112,503445,2013/8/16,5,"OUTSTANDING!!  The combination of flavors works so well!  I used less than half of the pineapple.  I think 1 whole cucumber/half pineapple is a better proportion.  Otherwise, it&#039;s perfect!  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers!"
80353,503445,2013/8/24,5,Oh man - perfect!  Really.
128473,503445,2016/8/3,5,"Wow, I`d like to give you 10 stars. This was wonderful. So much flavor and spice. I loved it. Easily my favorite dish of the Quest so far. Kudos on making it into my Favorites Cookbook for 2016 PanNan. Happily made for CQ3 - Thailand &amp; Indonesia."
1783373,503445,2016/8/8,5,WOWZA! The flavors in this most vibrant salad are clean and each bite just entices your taste buds to want more. I love the fact that it is healthy too. This one for sure will be made again and again. Thank you PanNan for sharing such a good one.
482376,503445,2016/8/11,5,"Wow! We loved this refreshing salad. The chili pepper gave it so much kick and the pineapple, cucumber and herbs were a great combination. Thank you so much!"
1620171,505748,2013/8/16,5,"My discerning partner said this deserves 5 stars and I don&#039;t disagree. Easy to prepare, we used it on chicken for Recipe #420507 and it was a lovely meal. Made for ZWT 9 for the Tasty Testers in the Spice Challenge."
47892,505748,2013/8/22,5,"I used whole spices that were roasted first then ground to a powder. Tested with a simple&lt;br/&gt;egg salad sandwich: mayo, the spice mixture, salt, green, cucumber, bread. Yum! Made for ZWT9."
526666,505748,2013/8/26,5,"Simple and flavorful, we enjoyed this aromatic spice blend. I rubbed it on chicken breasts (but forgot to take a pic of that) and we scarfed it down! Thanks for sharing, Nif!"
77458,500819,2013/5/31,5,Tried this last night for dinner and while I left out the cheese (I thought that would make it too rich for me) I kept the recipe as is. Very tasty and will make this again and again.
136997,500819,2013/11/14,5,"Tasty little patty. I used ground pork, as I needed to use some up. Made for pammyowl&#039;s Cook a Thon."
679953,500401,2014/1/18,5,"I rarely make recipes due to rum and other alcohol in them, and this was no exception,  I did make 2 different servings for us.  One without the rum, and one with.  Tried them both.  Make this with the rum.  The other was still pretty good though.  Back to the original recipe, other than omitting the arrow root, and halving the salt.  Very flavorful, and the pork was nice and tenderful.  Made for  a nice lunch.  Did add a dash of steak seasoning ( a light sprinkle.)."
2687887,494615,2013/2/10,4,We loved it!! Perfect for the Paleo lifestyle.
157167,494615,2013/9/6,5,"I&#039;ve never had a chia pudding before, and was looking for a recipe since I just bought a large bag of chia seed.  This was delicious, and my son was happy to try it since it had familiar fruit and coconut flavors :)"
1291498,507472,2013/10/10,3,"This recipe made nice and moist muffins but hardly tasted like pumpkin,  at least double the spices!"
39835,515587,2014/5/23,5,This is great and easy too! I like the no-egg and no-cook ice cream and it tastes so full of strawberries. We will be making this a lot during the summer. Thanks for sharing!
914360,494972,2013/2/21,5,"THIS is five stars !!!,  I think it should be n a menu !"
1359842,494972,2013/2/21,0,Love it!
2216338,494972,2013/2/23,5,"Oh my, this looks and sounds so good!  The hubs is going to enjoy this.  sw%u263A"
2707138,494972,2013/2/23,5,Loved this dish!  Will be making it again soon!
2786941,496964,2013/4/15,5,"What a fantastic recipe! It is just as soft as it looks in the photos I posted. Even better, this recipe uses about half the butter and eggs of most of the others I have seen...nice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I thought that 2 tablespoons of yeast seemed like a lot, so I reduced this to about 2-2.5 tsp., which is what seems more typical for gluten free loaves of this size. I also threw in about 1/4 cup of dry milk powder. Other than that, I followed this one completely. It rose beautifully and would probably look even bigger if I did it in a slightly smaller pan (I just hand-mixed it and then used my gigantic bread machine as the oven)."
2707200,494972,2013/2/23,0,Yummy! Want this for dinner tonight. Thanks Deb!
705251,509250,2014/1/26,4,This is a very fudge-like type of pie.  I suggest reducing the confectioner&#039;s sugar by 1/2 cup at first and then adding bit by bit until you get the texture you&#039;d like as mine ended up a bit dry.  The chocolate covering became a hard glaze which lifted a bit from the peanut butter layer when cutting.  It has a nice sweet flavor.  Based on the title it is like a peanut butter cup in texture and sweetness.
2001837955,520500,2017/12/4,5,Fabulous way to cook a roast. My 19 lb rid eye took 7 hours and was perfect. Medium rare. Fork tender. Everyone wanted the recipe and was amazed at the method. I tented with foil after removing from oven and served about 2 hours later. Still warm. Excellent no hassle way to cook. I did not need to brown at 500. It had a nice color and crust when I removed it from the oven.
2904885,503416,2013/7/16,5,The texture is smooth with outside golden brown. Taste so good and not too sweet.&lt;br/&gt;This is my first time baking. Totally worth to try it!!
1802849661,509330,2016/11/15,4,"I love &quot;normal&quot; latkes so wanted to try this meat version. They taste great and are really easy to make! I used 3 huge potatoes and 1 and 1/2lbs ground beef, but did find I had way more meat than potato; not to worry as I just cooked the meat up anyway and we'll use it for dinner!"
296809,503202,2013/8/23,5,"Made exactly as written for the Goddesses of ZWT-9, this lovely dessert deserves 10 stars! While it is definitely simple (to fix) &amp; refreshing, (to eat) as stated in your intro, that description definitely understates the recipe. It is as good as any cr&egrave;me brulee I have ever made or eaten. The brown sugar gives it a lovely caramel flavor &amp; color plus the use of pineapple is brilliant! I am so happy I found your recipe &amp; I promise you it will grace our table again soon &amp; often. Thx for sharing your recipe w/us. It has found a place among our all-time faves. :-) Edited to Add: The yield was spot-on = 4 ramekin-size servings as seen in the pic."
480195,503202,2013/8/25,5,"After my Goddesses of ZWT-9 posted the wonderful picture of her completion of this dish, I decided to make it immediately and I&#039;m so glad I did. This is such a wonderful dessert. The flavor is light and refreshing, but so rich and creamy at the same time. I will make this often. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
131126,503202,2013/8/25,5,"After seeing twissis&#039; photo I added this to my must try list. I am so glad I did!  It&#039;s simple, but so delicious! The creamy coconut milk &amp; pineapple raise the bar to a custard dessert.  I opted to only puree the pineapple in a Ninja chopper so I didn&#039;t have to drag out the blender. The puree was then stirred into the rest of the mix.  It worked out fine.  I will definitely repeat the recipe. Thank you for sharing!"
1072693,514982,2014/4/23,5,"I was looking for a way to use up some Easter ham and wanted to make some fried rice. This recipe worked great! I had everything on hand except the peas and I subbed the ham for the chicken. I only used one clove of garlic, next time I will use the two you initially suggested. Thanks for posting, the garlic butter definitely puts this one over the top."
2000206001,514982,2015/5/15,5,This is so close to Benihana&#039;s recipe it&#039;s scary!   I found this 5 days ago and I&#039;ve made it twice.  The butter is the key to this dish.   Thanks again!
2000277533,514982,2015/6/18,5,I wanted you to know this is a huge hit with my family!!! I did not put in peas and carrots as a personal choice but other than that I followed it to a T. I have kids asking for the recipe. So I am sending them to this site! VERY WELL DONE!!!
2000488389,514982,2015/9/21,5,Definitely a really close match to the real recipe. I used an extra clove of garlic and added 2 tsp of lemon juice to the garlic butter. I would recommend making a little more garlic butter than asked for. Delicious and great!
2001288751,514982,2017/1/7,1,I have the original benihana chicken fried rice recipe this isnt even close to it. Good try though..
2001471607,514982,2017/4/4,5,"I've tried and failed at making chicken fried rice more times than I can count. I had a craving today and searched for the &quot;best Benihana chicken fried rice&quot; and this recipe came up. I was scared, but went for it based on the reviews. I'm SOOOOOOO glad I did! Fantastic flavor, easy to follow recipe. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts (personal preference) and it came out fabulous. Thank you for putting this recipe together. It will become my go-to!"
2001515600,514982,2017/4/30,5,"Oh my goodness! Fantastic. The only thing I found is that 4 cups of rice was way too much for the 2 of us, but hey, we have dinner tomorrow night! I used shrimp instead of the chicken, it is just divine. I also used 4 eggs. Have saved to favorites and will eventually make with chicken. Thank you!"
2001709604,514982,2017/9/11,5,My family loved this recipe. It was easy to make and just delicious. Thank you for the detailed instructions.
2002107850,514982,2018/4/11,1,Definetly not even close to the Benihana recipe. I've used other resipes by far much better. I can say I'll never used this one again. Sorry if your going to say Best copycat recipe. It should be closer to it. Followed directions exactly. Guess I'll have to post the recipe I have (which I should have looked for instead of searching for a different one)
37449,512718,2014/2/3,5,I added some onions for flavor and  enjoyed the buttery taste!  Thanks!
866963,512718,2014/2/5,5,Very nice and easy way to make potatoes. I did add a couple cloves of garlic and some onion for added flavor. They went very well with the pork tenderloin and green beans we had for dinner. I plan on making them regularly. (2)
226863,512718,2014/3/23,5,"Delicious!  I normally do mine in water and add the butter at the end.  But this way the butter seeps into the potato. Loved this, and it will be a repeat.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag."
440735,502997,2013/8/22,3,I followed the recipe to the &quot;t&quot; but I thought it was bland. I rarely cook with saffron so I don&#039;t know if saffron is a mild spice or not? The addition of the pistachios were very yummy!  Made for ZWT for the Gourmet Goddesses July 2013.
1137158,517404,2015/2/20,2,"Cookie made as listed is just sweet, no zingy ginger flavor. I added at least a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger and there is no way it could make 10 dozen cookies. There was just over 3 cups of batter. You have to make them smaller than bite sized to get that many."
169430,499599,2014/4/29,5,"Great flavors that went perfectly with  Recipe #504502 this evening. This is something that is going into my keeper book, yum! Made for PAC 2014"
37449,499599,2014/5/1,5,"A yummy salad that I had with som caramalized carrot risotto. Thanks! Made for Pick a Chef, spring 2014."
2549237,512719,2014/5/9,5,"This chili was very easy and much better than I expected.  I was afraid that this was going to be too spicy for my young children to eat, but still followed the recipe exactly and found that the heat was just right.  We used feta cheese because bleu cheese triggers my migraines, but still thought that it was very good.  I loved the addition of cauliflower in this and that it used cannellini beans.  I especially loved that this didn&#039;t have meat in it since I am not able to eat much protein since being put on chemo.  Thank you for a great comfort meal Debbwl.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
2002095183,512719,2018/4/18,0,Just thinking. How would it be with chick peas instead of beans?
169430,508402,2014/3/20,5,"Oh my goodness, big smile here! I used gold baby potatoes and two peppers (green and yellow) which is what I had on hand. Loved, loved, loved the seasoning&#039;s used here. Delicious with salmon and lemon garlic rice last night. :D"
280271,513673,2014/3/10,5,I made a Polish dish using an English cucumber produced in Mexico...now that is what I call an international dish...I cut the recipe in half and kept a good part of the skin on the cucumber for texture and color...I used the sour cream...hubby and I enjoyed a nice tart taste that the dish offered...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
482933,513673,2014/5/26,5,Enjoyed this very much! Simple to make and appreciate that I usually have these ingredients on hand.  Also appreciate that it does not have raw onion. Thank you rpgaymer for sharing.
2002327547,516064,2018/11/10,5,I made this yesterday morning for breakfast and it was absolutely delicious!!! I used coconut sugar instead and put some raspberries on top and it was wonderful! Thank you for this recipe!!
865936,502955,2013/7/20,4,I love the recipe&#039;s title. It is very clever to use all green things. Delicious!
447487,502955,2013/7/26,5,"Dienia, thanks so much for posting this lovely chicken salad recipe ! Dh was very skeptical when he saw me cutting up apples and grapes, he was soon convinced. We both loved it and are looking forward to many lunches made with it. From the salad itself, to wraps (tortilla for dh and lettuce wraps for me), to sandwiches and anything else we can think of to put it with. Love the crunch of the apple and the sweet of the grapes. Made during ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers!"
2000981068,530291,2018/2/4,5,I loved it. I will make again. I added mushrooms and peppers. Very easy.
46008351,500954,2014/9/6,4,Just finished eating this tonight.  Very very good and very very easy.  We don&#039;t have a mandolin so the matchsticks took a little longer but totally worth it!!  Followed the recipe with the parmesan and toasted almonds.  Definitely will make this again!!
480195,503911,2013/7/24,5,I served this for breakfast with some crusty bread and we loved it. I used half gruyere and half haloumi cheese. I served some Greek olives alongside. DH wants this again soon. Thanks for the recipe.
1060667,523977,2016/3/8,5,"Very good!!  The nuts are amazing, I had to use pecans cause that&#039;s what I had.  The hint of cayenne is wonderful.  Used blue cheese instead of parmesan, it&#039;s seemed to fit in this salad better to me.  The dressing isn&#039;t very pretty, but taste great, needs a pinch of salt though, I added some after tasting.  Thanks for a great salad!!"
560491,505384,2014/4/30,5,This is a very good dish and so easy to make!  I was concerned the potatoes wouldn&#039;t be done in the allotted time but they came out perfectly tender.  I made this with chicken broth since we are not vegetarians and I served it with grilled chicken.  There are lots of leftovers (since it was just DH and I) so will be good with a little smoked sausage mixed in.  This is a great Fall/Winter dish...Made for Spring PAC 2014.
323186,505384,2014/5/26,5,"Sharon, we really enjoyed this, served alongside roasted zucchini and some pork sausages for DH!  Lots of leftovers, which made him very happy, good lunches to look forward to!  A good vegetable dish, hearty and comforting,  ideal for our current winter weather.   Thank you, made and enjoyed for I Recommend tag game"
43042277,505384,2017/3/26,5,"Excellent dish the entire family enjoyed. Used halved marble potatoes, since that's what I had on hand. Needed to cook them longer. Thanks for sharing!"
2001362583,503366,2017/1/23,5,"Quick, easy, and delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. The whole buncha people it fed raved about this soup."
1052873,518259,2014/8/29,4,"My husband said &#039;are there marshmallows in this&#039;? And had it in his mouth before I said, no, that&#039;s feta cheese. I would have left the cheese out. I&#039;m unsure about the craisins. Otherwise the mix is great. I used Newman&#039;s Own Balsamic vinaigrette. Very easy to make. Made for CQ 14."
2216338,524479,2015/12/8,5,Tasty recipe!
480195,503287,2013/8/4,5,DELICIOUS! These turned out light and with excellent flavor. I served them with sour cream and lingonberry preserves. We had a memorable breakfast. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.
2549237,503287,2013/8/11,5,"So, I&#039;m sick and in the hospital, but my husband has been cooking for the ZWT9 challenges and for himself and our kids.  They really enjoyed this breakfast and he said it was easy to prepare.  I will definitely be making this for our family when I get home and recooperated.  Thanks Dienia B.  Made for team Tasty Testers during ZWT9."
157167,503287,2013/9/3,3,"These were light and had a great flavor, but I thought there was WAY too much butter - my ungreased belgian waffle maker was spitting butter out the sides as the waffles were cooking, and I ended up with 1/4 cup of melted butter in the drip tray.  But with half the butter I think they would be perfect.  For ZWT9 family picks"
1072593,500002,2015/9/16,5,"We all deserve something good from the universe.  Me:  &#039;Universe, please
give me some California Roll Rice Salad?&#039;  Universe:  &#039;Okay, go to Target, buy the ingredients and then cook it.&#039;  I&#039;m sure we can work this out somehow."
2000662938,524479,2015/11/10,5,Great idea and easy to make
2667767,524479,2015/11/10,5,Great kid-friendly idea!
2201870,524479,2015/11/10,5,What a neat platter recipe! I love this idea!
1592049,524479,2015/11/10,0,So Delicious Beautiful Presentation :-)
2201427,524479,2015/11/11,5,What a wonderful idea!!!  Sounds delicious ....  a &quot;must try&quot;!!
1802618179,524479,2015/11/12,5,The list of ingredients alone let&#039;s you know you&#039;re in for a treat!  Yummy and clever!
418718,524479,2015/11/17,5,Look Beautiful and sound really good !!! and very good idea for the Holiday!
2677925,524479,2015/11/17,5,Looks so good.
2672297,524479,2015/11/25,5,Incredibly creative recipe!  Good luck to you!
747829,524479,2015/11/26,5,Sounds great!!

306726,524479,2015/11/30,5,What a great recipe! This would be good  to serve for our football party!!!!
2000689016,524479,2015/11/30,5,Love hummus! Perfect for parties!
2198132,524479,2015/12/2,5,What a creative recipe - yum!!
2200921,524479,2015/12/2,5,Awesome recipe
2657133,524479,2015/12/3,5,Nice recipe!
2000726697,524479,2015/12/3,5,"This is a great color, flavor and texture combination.  A+ recipe!"
2192172,524479,2015/12/3,5,Wonderfully creative recipe for Hummus!
2000019392,517535,2015/2/23,2,"I used the butter that it called dor in the receipe. The butter was very cold, ut these cookies did not raise the way they should have.  This always seems to happen when I only use butter, instead of equal amounts of butter and shortening . I won&#039;t use this recipe again"
2001133636,517535,2016/8/19,2,"Cookies rose just fine but we're very bland, crumbly and cake-like instead of moist and chewy. They looked perfect from the outside but just didn't taste as good as my regular recipe, which contains vanilla and a mixture of butter and shortening."
128473,506752,2013/12/28,5,"What a lovely recipe ~Nimz~.  It was simply delicious....so very tasty.  We enjoyed this entree very much, served with mashed potatoes and Coconut Creamed Corn. It made the perfect comfort food birthday dinner that I was craving.  The pork was moist and tender and the gravy was delish.  The dish was quick and easy to make.  Thanks so much for sharing another winner my friend."
724631,506752,2014/1/31,4,"Simplicity, exactly what one can prepare while following a football game! It was tasty.  Although the directions only stated medium-high heat, I turned the heat to medium-low for the hour of simmering.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
452355,505617,2013/8/22,5,"I scaled the ingredients back to serve as a drink for one.  I used Thai basil from my garden.  While I would not say I preferred this to a traditional mojito, I liked it a lot and found that the Thai basil lent a spicy twist to the drink.  Very refreshing.  Made for ZWT9"
80353,505617,2013/8/26,5,Very aromatic and refreshing.  My husband could smell these even before I brought them out to the balcony!
204024,506771,2014/4/13,5,Delicious and easy to make.   We were able to find the cilantro paste at the store.  I only used the juice of 1 large lemon.   Not sure what size of lemons the recipe calls for but the amount we used was perfect.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
2000921980,517010,2017/7/21,0,"My brother lives here, so I had to check the recipe out."
128473,510947,2014/4/29,3,"I am sorry to say that this recipe did not turn out for me.  I had a lot of difficulty with it....the cookies hardened too quickly, and were too dry.  I believe that there was too much dry ingredients for the amount of liquid, or that the cooking time was too long.  I cooked for 3 minutes only.  The few cookies that had shape were too hard to eat.  I saved the crumbs for adding to pudding, ice cream, cakes and cookies as the flavor was very nice.  I am giving three stars because of the flavor of the cookies only....Thank you for sharing.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
217369,518497,2016/9/18,5,We tried this on the BBQ and it was delicious! We then tried it while camping over the edge of the campfire coals with some freshly picked blackberries nearby and it was heavenly! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!
1680722,496506,2013/4/8,5,Delicious!&lt;br/&gt;I prepared 16 magnific buns and we ejoyed each of 2 pieces still hot. &lt;br/&gt;The comment was: like warm panettone!&lt;br/&gt;For this recipe I used a mix of candied lemon and orange zest as well as good portions of raisins.&lt;br/&gt;I let them rise on the tray for about 1 hours and baked them later as I was home again.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this wonderfuld snack!
888035,496506,2014/4/14,5,"The instructions were very clear and easy to follow.&lt;br/&gt;These were my first try at Hot Cross Buns and they turned out very well in spite of a few glitches. I used a rectangular Pyrex pan about the same as the recommended size and made 20 buns to fill the space. They were a little cramped so next time I&#039;ll use my next biggest pan. &lt;br/&gt;After 16 minutes the tops were very brown so I took them out, flipped them onto a tea towel, onto racks and realized they weren&#039;t done! So, with the help of my husband, we flipped them back into the pan and baked for six minutes more, covered with foil to prevent more browning. They still were a bit undercooked but tasted delicious and I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll be perfect once toasted.&lt;br/&gt;For the piping I used 5 tablespoons of water instead of 4 and piped out of a ziplock bag.&lt;br/&gt;Kiwi readers: the 400g Pam&#039;s fruit cake mix is just right."
906665,496506,2014/4/25,4,"I liked the amount of fruit in these buns but they weren&#039;t as fluffy as I would have liked. I think I would have liked them a bit sweeter, too."
895132,516279,2014/10/6,5,"Yum!! This is an excellent salad, and I love the dressing. As I could not find the right peppers, I just used green bell pepper and added some slices of Jalapenos. A filling, satisfying and delicious dinner. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for For your Consideration."
227978,495311,2013/3/1,5,"This was delicious.  I thought the addition of so much ketchup, tomato sauce and tomato soup was too much, so I omitted the canned tomato soup and went with the ketchup and next bigger size can of tomato sauce.  And I thought it was a good outcome.  But the truly great thing about this recipe was that the chopped cabbage and green pepper added a lot of flavor to the pan sauce that made a hearty and tasty meal when I enjoyed leftover noodles and sauce (no more beef left) the next day.  I did include the beef when I first made this dish though, but I wouldn't hesitate to make this again without the beef, because I know we'll enjoy it all the same."
1422300,495311,2013/3/3,5,"We love cabbage and liked this recipe. I also omitted the tomato soup but added the ketchup with the tomato sauce. The minced garlic, oregano, basil and thyme gave the sauce an excellent taste. Next time I will make this recipe with chicken pieces instead of the round steak for variety. Thanks for this recipe idea Chef, and good luck in the Dining on a Dollar Contest."
328048,503683,2013/7/25,4,"I don&#039;t have a grill so I made this under the broiler and it came out a little dry, but this still had great flavor. Definitely a keeper."
47892,493013,2013/1/16,5,"Made as written except for adding in some baby arugula with the baby spinach. Love all the<br/>different flavors: peppery, sour, sweet, etc. Reviewed for NA*ME Explores OMAN. Great salad! (PS Tested with apple cider vinegar.)"
447487,502880,2013/7/27,5,"I made this as an appetizer to our Greek meal this evening. I LOVE this recipe ! I can&#039;t have pita as I&#039;m allergic to wheat so I used a simple slice of white GF bread and I couldn&#039;t made two or three and made it as a meal. DH really enjoyed his on a pita as a nice light, after work snack. Thanks for a lunch/snack recipe I&#039;ll be turning to often, EK ! Made during ZWT#9 for my team, Tasty Testers :)"
498271,502880,2013/9/4,5,"This is a delicious little Greek pizza!  Loved all the veggies and the pita crust is just right.  Served with fruit salad for a light dinner and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
242729,513769,2014/3/6,5,"Cooked in my crockpot, this was an amazing recipe, full of flavour. I served this for lunch with crusty bread and salad and I have half left for another meal. I used baking parchment instead of foil to line my slow cooker and I also used sea salted French butter in the recipe. Made for make my recipe in the Aussie/Kiwi forum, thanks Pat for a little gem of a recipe! Karen/FT"
461834,513769,2014/8/10,5,"What wonderful potatoes!!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe and since we were grilling out bacon-wrapped chicken, I just put these in a square foil/aluminum pan and then covered them in foil as you would do for the oven.  They were cooked perfectly and loved all the flavors from the onion, cheese and bacon, so good!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for  &quot;For your Consideration&quot; tag game."
2001654423,513769,2017/11/20,5,This is a new family favorite. Make the full recipe as the leftovers go quickly. Bake this in the oven at 395 degrees for 1 - 1/2 hours in an oblong glass baking dish or large cassarole dish.
220195,493013,2014/2/17,5,"I have the Jerusalam cookbook (highly recommend it), and made this salad from the cookbook. It&#039;s a VERY good salad, I will also be making it again. Opening the dates to pit them, we discovered that they can sometimes have black mold inside. This was a good lesson for us to always open them to check! Only one had it, but I wouldn&#039;t want to be the one that ate it. I also let the date/vinegar/onion mixture longer than called for, and it was just fine. The sumac-coated pita chips are the highlight of this salad, but all the flavors work wonderfully together. I am no big fan of raw spinach salads, but I&#039;d eat this one just about any day."
1680722,503156,2014/3/13,5,"This is an easy and great recipe!&lt;br/&gt;I prepared the batter as described and I baked it in silicon muffins molds making 20 small pieces.&lt;br/&gt;After dropping the batter in mold i dropped some slivered almonds on the top and I baked them about 25 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;I prepared the syrup but I reduced the quantity (I prepared only one quarter of the suggested quantity) as I&#039;m trying to avoid to many carbs. I poured the syrup on the baked muffins which adsorved the the syrup very well.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot fot posting this delicious halvas recipe, I&#039;m glad I prepared these as we all liked them very much and enjed them imagiing we are in Greece on vacations!"

2795375,516952,2018/2/1,5,"Very good and healthy soup! The only change that I made was adding 2 or 3 more carrots, giving it a bit more color. Very tasty and even better on day two! 9/23/2017: I've made this recipe many times and must add that it freezes very nicely :) I make it often. It's OK to omit the spinach (or use fresh spinach is good), and use one can of black beans with one can of kidney beans."
339260,505856,2013/9/12,5,There&#039;s nothing like delicious grilled onions to top a steak.  These onions were loaded with flavor.  No more plain grilled onions for my steaks...I&#039;m using this recipe from now on.  I made them in a cast iron skillet.  Yummy!  Made for September Aus/NZ Swap.
599450,505856,2013/9/30,5,"Made these as directed with large sweet onions in the cast iron skillet and they are GREAT! They are perfect with steak, pork chops, or chicken. Thanks, gailanng. Made for Aussie Kiwi Recipe Swap."
2001303066,530160,2017/2/7,5,I was amazed at how easy and healthy these hash brown potatoes were and not the greasy aftertaste. It has so many possibilities with simply using other seasonings. This will definitely be a regular side dish in our family.
2000053147,530160,2017/5/7,1,I don't think I can put much faith in Tom G's recipes if he doesn't know the difference between hash browns and home fires...
2002168898,530160,2018/5/29,5,"You can either Shred potatoes or Cube potatoes to make potato Hash Browns. When I make them, I cube them. It's a lot easier then shredding."
480195,502791,2013/9/6,5,A slice of this with our afternoon tea was delightful. Very good flavor. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
2000095513,502791,2015/3/28,4,The main ingredients are great but the recipe as is comes out too soft (almost mushy) and requires more flour. Sweet bread should be on the tougher side. I also added a bit of baking powder which turned out nice.
2002174727,502791,2018/6/4,4,Great flavor..requires more flour..I used 5 cups of flour and 1 full cup of sugar... other wise.. really good
2002234143,502791,2018/7/30,5,"I followed the instructions to the letter and it was spot on!! Thank you very much! It was very tasty, OMG!"
2585084,502884,2013/8/5,5,"This is definitely some sweet fire water.  I love it.  The chili powder, hot sauce, and pineapple compliment this cocktail perfectly."
383346,502884,2013/8/9,3,"I&#039;m so sorry but for us it didn&#039;t work.  Maybe if it would have been more sweet with the same heat, we would have like it better.  Thanks Lynn :)  Made for ZWT9"
157167,503566,2013/7/25,5,"I made half a batch, which was perfect as a side dish for three people.  Great flavor, and so simple to throw together.  For ZWT9"
266635,503566,2013/9/14,5,"This is amazingly delicious.  The combination of the flavors is sooo good -- the sweet/sour syrupy balsamic along with the tartness of the lemon and of course the honey make a wonderful dressing.  I have fallen in love with dates as of late and I love the addition of them in this salad.  This salad can only get better over time.  Adding to my Best of 2013 Cookbook.  Made for NA/ME, September, 2013."

577585,495010,2013/2/19,5,A very satisfying and easy dessert. I will definitely make this again.
461834,505080,2014/2/7,5,"Just loved this salad!!!  This is going into my favorites for 2014.  I did make a few changes based on my taste and fresh produce available at this time.  I made 1/2 of the dressing and subbed apple juice for the cider and just loved this dressing and was thrilled there was no oil.  Strawberries are in season/on sale here in FL (Strawberry Festival is the end of this month), so I opted to use those for the berries.  I hate blue cheese, so I used a Monterey Jack cheese and I am not a fan of walnuts, so used almonds.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  It will be a repeat often!!  Made for your win of the Superbowl Football Pool, congrats!!!"
1802922283,505080,2014/7/12,0,"Looks interesting, but the recipe doesn&#039;t match the picture.  Recipe calls for blackberries or cherries, and those are strawberries.  Also, it calls for blue cheese, the cheese in the picture is something that can be shredded, like parmesan, or romano.  Or even a softer cheese, like white cheddar."
560491,496840,2013/4/18,5,"This was so quick and easy with great flavor!  I decreased this to 2 servings and served as a side dish, but will be making it as a main meal!  I used fresh green beans, leftover baked ham from Easter and seasoned with season salt and fresh cracked pepper.  Made for Spring PAC 2013."
865936,514161,2014/5/8,5,"This marinade has tons of flavor without too much heat.  I&#039;ve seen many similar recipes, but with much more pepper.  This is a nice improvement without sacrificing flavor.  Made for PAC."
482376,505080,2015/3/2,5,Delicious salad! Well worth the extra bit of effort. The candied nuts were awesome and the dressing so flavorful. I used apple juice vs. apple cider. I also used strawberries and feta cheese (I&#039;m allergic to blue cheese). All flavors and textures came together beautifully. Thank you!
169430,513742,2014/8/13,5,"Well, this is a keeper recipe for sure. It comes together quickly and will go along with so many things. Top on my list right now is on top of a steak hot off the grill. I did need to add a touch more salt but that is personal taste and nothing against the recipe at all. Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
226863,495761,2013/10/14,5,"This is an absolutely beautiful and delicious fish dish!  I didn&#039;t use halibut because I had fresh amberjack, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This was devoured so quickly there wasn&#039;t time to get a photo.  I&#039;ll definitely make this again, and will try to get one then. Thanks for sharing!  Made for your Football Tag win during week 5! Congrats!"
865936,495761,2014/2/6,5,This is a really easy and delicious way to prepare fish fillets.  I used a blue fish fillet that a neighbor gave to me and just increased the ingredients (since it is so big!) and cooked it a little longer.  Came out beautifully!  Thanks for posting.  Made for 2013 Football Tag.
39835,495761,2014/2/22,5,Great fish! I used cod and  thyme instead of the tarragon but otherwise made as directions. As the cod was very thick and half frozen I needed to cook it quite a bit longer  than the recipe indicated. thanks for sharing!
2544950,514892,2014/3/26,5,"Wow! This was so quick and easy to make and my family loved it!! This is going to the top of my weekly QUICK AND EASY list.

1803530715,522775,2018/5/24,4,Descriptions are tough to convert - Does &quot;Eat the Middle First&quot; cookie refer to an OREO?

340141,503200,2013/8/24,5,"Very fast and easy meal; DH loved it.   I thought it would be a touch better without the sugar in the meat; however, as my sister pointed out, some hoisin&#039;s are sweeter than others, and you might need to sugar with a less-sweet hoisin.   As for amount, I doubled the meat portion.   I used 3/4 of it for the recipe.   The other 1/4 is saved for a burger tomorrow.    If you&#039;re making this for only two people, you might want to use only 1/2 of your french bread and the meat mixture because it makes quite a bit.   (Of course, if you stay with the original amount, it might be just right for two people.   I wanted a higher ratio of meat to bread.)   Also, don&#039;t spread the hoisin TOO thin all over.   It was delicious to bite into a pocket of slightly more hoisin.   Overall, just a great recipe.   ZWT9"
296809,503200,2013/8/25,4,"Made for a fellow Goddess of ZWT-9 ~ While we enjoyed this a lot, I did do a fair amt of tweaking to get an optimum result (for us). :-) I made my own Hoisin sauce using Recipe #312992 by Alskann, was generous spreading it on the individual baguette rolls I used &amp; my yield was 8 of the sml baguette rolls for a full recipe. I found the meat mixture a bit bland &amp; feel it would benefit from the addition of more hoisin sauce. The meat rolls also looked a bit ordinary &amp; not quite done at the end of the cook time, so I used my pastry brush to spread hoisin over the surface &amp; cooked them about 10-12 min longer. All that said, they were an easy-fix, well-flavored by the extra hoisin sauce &amp; fully-cooked. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
2001390987,522775,2018/6/27,1,What the heck? packagespc eat the middle first cookies This recipe is bazzar!
610488,503200,2013/8/26,5,This is a Cambodian Hamburger!! Not that I think its a bad thing. Actually it turned out to be a great meal and one that was very filling. I agree with the previous recipes in that you can&#039;t have enough hoisin sauce. I also cooked everything a bit longer since I don&#039;t care for undercooked meat (I&#039;m a cook it until it&#039;s burnt kind of chef). Easy to make and something I think everyone would enjoy!
498271,503200,2014/2/1,5,"Wow this was just terrific!  As other reviewers did I added some hoisin sauce to the meat as well as spreading it on the bread.  I cooked mine for an additional 10 minutes to ensure that the meat was cooked to our liking.  I was pleased that the bread didn&#039;t get soggy or overly crispy.  I think you could do this same cooking method with other flavor profiles too (maybe salsa with southwestern spices, or tomato sauce with Italian seasonings).  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for the Best of 2013 event, recommended by Debbie R."
37449,513363,2014/3/20,5,Yummy! I used olive oil and the lesser amount of sriracha sauce. Loved it over a baby greens salad. Thanks!
2002163435,513363,2018/5/25,5,Awesome!!! Love it
487088,492902,2013/3/4,5,I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of flavor with so few ingredients. I love my rice cooker and I really like this recipe. I cook a lot of rice and this recipe goes into the keeper file for sure. And it couldn't be any easier!
2925517,500510,2013/7/31,4,"I&#039;ve seen similar recipes for crock-pot chicken teriyaki for the past few months, decided to try this one. I tried three different batches, in short, everything listed as (Optional) you can leave out without much impact on the flavor. You can definitely leave out the soy sauce!! The optional 1/2 cup of soy sauce is way too much for this recipe, even 1/4 cup of soy sauce was going overboard! Sesame oil really isn&#039;t needed. Adding light sesame seeds for appearance and texture will be ok."
44814973,500510,2013/10/23,2,Would not recommend this recipe.. too watery and not a lot of flavor.   I added steamed vegetables  and a small amount of soy sauce.
1803625087,500510,2015/1/7,1,"Tried this tonight.  Very watery and needed to be thickened.  I added 1/4 cup soy and some sesame seeds.  Didn&#039;t taste bad, but not sure I will be making it again."
1803790874,500510,2015/2/16,0,"This was a HUGE disappointment. Found the recipe on Pinterest with a very appetizing picture included. The picture had nothing to do with the actual recipe, which I doubled because I was so excited about it. It was like a soup with mushy pieces of chicken swimming in it. I deleted the pin and I do not recommend this recipe."
2000487729,497727,2015/9/20,0,"Fabulous!!  I&#039;ll never buy a can of COM soup again!  I rarely buy canned because of the sodium, but once in awhile a recipe calls for it.  Today was that day and no COM!  Ahhhh!  Going to the store wasn&#039;t an option, so I started looking and found this recipe.  It was PERFECT.  Thank you so much!"
2001413371,520673,2017/3/2,2,"The hydration level of this dough is WAY off. Eggs are about 50g each @ around 75% hydration, milk is 245g per cup, and flour is about 120g per cup. This gives a hydration of 66%. That is like a pretty wet bread dough, not even close to noodles which are usually in the 40%ish range (or even lower). I'm guessing the author includes a LOT of flour on the work surface when they knead. No way this recipe as stated will get you noodles."
381180,506804,2013/10/11,5,"Nice and sweet-tart! Just the way I like it! I added a pinch of salt to the crust, the zest of three lemons and a pinch of salt to the lemon filling. I added the coconut to the raw filling ~ next time I&#039;ll try them in an 8x8 pan for a thicker bar, and will bake a little longer.

323186,503615,2013/7/15,5,"Very much enjoyed, I made this exactly as written, other than chopping the breasts into bite-sized pieces, we just prefer chicken that way.   I loved the lemon and walnuts in this dish, and the use of yoghurt.   A really nice dish to enjoy anytime, made for ZWT9, thank you, teammate!"
143721,503615,2013/7/17,4,"First, we really liked the flavor of this dish.  My problem, and mostly it is &quot;my problem&quot; is that the sauce was VERY THIN!  Don&#039;t know what I did wrong??  Followed instructions and ingredients exactly as written.  The walnuts gave a nice touch.  May try again.  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;."
169430,499157,2013/4/30,5,"Very tasty and simple recipe, it&#039;s a snap to make. Used cat fish as don&#039;t currently have cod in the house. That turned out very well. The coating is light and you really can&#039;t beat the low calorie and sugar content."
266635,497369,2013/4/18,4,"These bars were very tasty - loved the ingredients.  But, for some reason, they did not get firm.  I followed the recipe and refrigerated them, but they did not firm up.  The taste, though, was really good and I might try freezing the recipe to see if it will work.  Made for Spring PAC, April, 2013."
2180168,517285,2014/7/15,5,"DH really enjoyed this one. It would be okay not doing the final step in the oven since everything is already cooked, but then you would miss the yummy topping."
2000495920,517285,2015/9/24,4,What is the oven temp?
2002094746,517285,2018/4/3,0,Should I cover before baking it or uncovered?

17803,505612,2013/8/21,5,This was a spicy good mid morning breakfast.  It was easy to fix.  I thought it maybe a little to spicy but it was perfect for me!    Made for team Soup-A-Stars during ZWT9 2013
47892,505612,2013/9/16,5,"I skipped the tomato blanching-my conscience is cleared. Fresh local eggs. Bam! Green onions from our CSA box. This dish totally rocks!

Made for Autumn NA*ME."
169430,505612,2013/9/17,5,I made one serving for my lunch today and loved every bite. The seasoning was on point and it was satisfying without being too filling. Really lovely flavors that come together easily and are very enjoyable.
542159,505612,2013/10/10,5,"Yummers! It is a good thing I cut this down to serve one or I would have over eaten as every bite was savored and the plate licked. I really liked the kick from the cayenne pepper. This is a great meal for anytime of the day, thanks for the very tasty post."
496803,502788,2013/7/17,5,"I was really torn between giving this 4 stars or five.  The taste is DEFINITELY five star, which is ultimately what made me decide to rate it as such.  We just loved it, and couldn&#039;t stop eating it.  I served it with shrimp for dipping, but even the non-shrimp lovers kept coming back for more with their tortilla chips!  It has just enough bite to call it spicy, but not so much that you can&#039;t taste the other flavors.  We have one complete heat-wimp in the group who found it too spicy, but everyone else thought it was perfect.  My only small qualm was that it is a little on the thin side, but given how wonderful it tasted, I&#039;ll let that pass. If I make a homemade mayo next time, I can overcome that (very small) issue.  Made for ZWT9."
37449,502788,2013/7/22,4,Served this over Cajun Spiced Portobellos with success. Loved all the flavors. Thanks! Made for ZWT#9 2013 for team Hot Stuff!

128473,513434,2014/2/20,5,"LIG, these pancakes were wonderful, just wonderful.  They were filled with super flavors, great textures and were quick and easy to make.  Perfect to serve to family and friends.Made as written but omitted whole wheat flour and flax seeds (allergies). This recipe made beautiful large, fluffy,  pancakes that will more than satisfy your cravings.  I garnished the pancakes with banana slices and some pure maple syrup.  I will be enjoying the rest of the pancakes later in the week, as I have frozen the rest.  Can&#039;t wait to enjoy them again.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Kudos for a recipe that has gone into my Best of 2014 cookbook."
80353,513434,2014/8/5,5,"These pancakes were light, fluffy and really wonderful!  I omitted the banana and topped the pancakes with Recipe #106262 and warm maple syrup.  The pecans went really well with the apple topping.  My family thinks I&#039;m awesome today. :-)"

895132,505804,2013/9/6,5,"Great dressing! The only change I made was to use lime juice instead of lemon because I found that I was out of lemons. For the sugar I used xylitol which is exactly the same in sweetness as normal sugar. This was perfect for us, thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 Family Picks for The Apron String Travelers"
1803559202,505804,2014/12/25,5,Great dressing. My family loved it.
400708,513434,2018/10/26,5,"Great Fall breakfast recipe. I had to sub WW Flour with all-purpose as that's what I had, then made as directed. Grinding half of the pecans insured that the pecan flavor was throughout the pancakes, and then the chopped gave that much enjoyed crunch. For topping I heated pure maple syrup with about 2 tablespoons of butter and when heated through stirred in the sliced banana, light, fluffy and enjoyed by all. A true winner recipe"
1801394484,509612,2013/12/27,5,These are very good I tried them last night for dinner best I have had so far for those of you who don&#039;t like Mexican style enchiladas these are great !!!!

1802698354,512230,2014/4/26,5,its an amazing sauce...we don&#039;t buy take out pizza anymore....and it can be used for more than just pizza...ive done lasagna....spaghetti.....wonderful flavor.
2736860,496713,2013/3/14,5,I love soup and this one surely satisfies.
1800354842,497371,2013/12/22,5,I found this in a magazine earlier this year. Every time i make it no matter who it is they love it. I am glad the recipe is here.
546010,497371,2013/12/24,5,"WOW, what is not to love dish, this is AMAZING!  I mixed the heavy cream with whole milk, used at least 1/2 C or more of parmesan-reggiano cheese, and a good tablespoon of fresh sage (chiffonade) added along with the parmesan. A healthy pinch of  nutmeg. The flavor of the pumpkin is somewhat subtle but not lacking. You may need a sprinkle of salt table side. This is outstanding and company worthy. Served with buttered peas. Thanks for posting Doogster. YUM!"

257254,506595,2013/9/17,0,"I will not put any stars on this because I was not familiar with radicchio, and it is not fair to rate a recipe based a main ingredient that you don&#039;t like.  I have found out that it is bitter, and I like it only in small quantities.  Perhaps the head of radicchio that I bought was larger than usual, but my impression of the first bite was &quot;Bitter!&quot;  I have since read other places online, and it appears to be common knowledge that it is bitter, so that is my mistake.  Oh, I also forgot to prepare and add the walnuts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe I made this with the wrong proportion of radicchio to iceberg, or maybe the head was not the freshest, I just don&#039;t know.  I would like to see what others think of it when they try it.  Those who liked hot food really loved the dressing, and others the bleu cheese.  One person went back for seconds at our movie night.  I really wanted to like this new-to-me recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I hope other people are not put off by my review, and do try this.  Go easy on the radicchio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you, Amy, for posting this, and I look forward to trying other of your recipes."

452355,504276,2013/8/7,4,"This recipe is really easy (no chopping) and plates elegantly.  The cream sauce itself is a little plain without the lift that it gets from the sherry.

226863,504276,2013/8/12,4,"I used amberjack about an inch and a half thick, but is a similar consistency and texture to cod....maybe a bit more dense, but very white and light tasting.

44771461,495379,2018/1/29,0,"The recipe will be considerably lower in carbs if you use whipping cream instead of the half-and-half, use regular cheese instead of reduced fat, plus grate your own since store-bought shredded cheese always has some kind of carbs added to keep the cheese from sticking together. It's usually potato starch or cellulose fiber. And the low-fat cottage cheese is way too high for anyone on a very low carb diet. I would use only half a cup of full fat ricotta cheese."
679953,505727,2013/8/26,5,"First, I halved this for DS, and I.  I did use cherry tomatoes, and skipped the pepper.  I&#039;ll tell you what a nice treat, for an early lunch.  The cooking time for me was 3 hours, put them in before the kids went to school, and the 3 hours seemed to work here.  The maple syrup does wonders, with the other ingredients,  A first time trying maple syrup on tomatoes, and so glad I did.  Tagged and made for PRMR."

169430,502186,2017/7/26,5,Scrumptious. Made last evening exactly to the directions and it was a treat. I used what was left of the roasted Saffron Pistachio's and they fit the recipe beautifully. I could be happy having this very often. There was not a thing that I didn't very much enjoy. Made for CQ 2017and Team Smok'in Chefs.
107135,492964,2013/7/17,5,liked this burger alot 2 things i did different  toasted bun 1st lightly buttered and griddled until browned and i added a dash of oregano cause my fav sand is gyro loved the spinach easy zwt9
157167,492964,2013/7/26,3,I doubled the recipe and cooked these in my convection oven using the burger mode instead of pan frying (less mess) :) Excellent burger. :)  For ZWT9
2597942,492964,2013/7/26,5,"I made these tonight for hubby &amp; I. Wonderful flavor! I have to say upfront, I&#039;m not a big fan of Feta... but being mixed into the burger it brought out a new flavor for hamburgers. I did not have fresh parsley, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of dried. I also used pre-packaged salad mix containing spinach. Stupid me... before even tasting it, we melted some cheddar slices on them (sorry, force of habit)... next time I will not :) I toasted some pretzel buns on the flame of my stovetop  (pretzel buns are cheap at Aldi&#039;s), and added some pre-cooked bacon (Oscar Mayer) to them. (I did not make the Recipe #492963... but maybe next time. I just used my mustard &amp; mayo dressing). This turned out to be one of the best pan-fried burgers I&#039;ve had (I normally pan fry or oven bake, and hubby does the grill). Thanks for a new take on a burger. (Made for ZWT9)"
895132,492964,2013/11/10,5,"Awesome burger, I loved the flavour! With the feta in it, there is no need for salt, and the burger is spicy and juicy, not dry at all. Made it with gluten free bun and my own sheep yoghurt tzatziki.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for leaving us this yummy burger recipe, dear Pammy :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for the Cookathon in memory of Pam November 2013."
2001774205,521616,2017/11/1,5,I used frozen shredded potatoes instead of tater tots - they mixed better with the biscuits and cheese. I also used more cheese and added a half cup of milk to the eggs. I baked it @ 385 instead of 400 for about 40 minutes. I have a 4 yr old grandson who hates everything and he inhaled this and asked for more. I added salsa when I plated my dish but thought about country gravy. It is wonderful and I think would work really well for a covered dish/carry in plate.
2001826465,521616,2017/11/26,1,"I followed the recipe almost; It baked up beautifully. I had greased the pan liberally and it stuck. When I served it, it was seriously dry (too much biscuits) and lacking flavor and seasoning. It would take major tweaking to fix it I think. But, I loved the idea of putting it in a bundt pan."
2002079460,521616,2018/3/27,5,"I made this last week. I was a little nervous about the Bundt Pan, but it was delicious. I had to freeze half of it because there are just the two of us. It freezes well and I used the Grand Crescent Rolls because I miss read the label of the rolls. It didn't seem to matter. I am going to try this in a 9 x 13 pan next time to check out the results... Great recipa."

58104,494612,2013/2/10,5,"Delicious! I used sea scallops that I defrosted, cut in half (making 32 pieces) and then pressed with weight between paper towels to get all the excess water out of them. I cut the flour, bread crumbs, cornmeal, and cayenne down to 1/2 the amount. Skipped the salt. Floured the scallops then dipped into the buttermilk and back into the flour mixture. I still had a lot of the flour mixture left over. So I suggest to keep most of the mixture aside in a separate bowl so you can save and use any leftover to make the next batch because you will make again. As for the tartar oh yum! I`m not a dipper but this was yummy. I made as an appetizer and for Po boys and had a lot left over this can easily serve 7 for a main meal as for appetizers it can feed 15. I will make again even though I`m not a fan of frying food. Wildflour you got a winner! thanks for making my DH very VERY Happy! Thanks for the easy to make and delish recipe. Good Luck!"

585980,507451,2014/1/18,0,this is one of the best cake recipes ever.  I have used it for years so was glad to find it here.  the recipe usually tends to stick in the pan so I always line my pan with parchment and grease and flour the pan and parchment if I will be turning out of the pan and decorating.  If serving from the pan I don&#039;t bother with the parchment
1802464039,507451,2014/2/7,0,"This is the most AWESOME cake ever.  We have been making this cake for over 25 years.   It is almost the only cake we make.  We have several really great cake recipes but this is the one we almost always default to.  Why have great when there is AWESOME!  Our family and friends always request it.  At work it is requested at least once or twice a month for birthdays.  You would think they would tire of it.  But it seems to be more popular than ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HINT:  DO NOT cook this the full time.  I can not emphasize this enough.  We cook it for 27 to 28 minutes.  When tested with a wooden tooth pick, it has moist crumbs sticking to the tooth pick.  If you cook it till the tooth pick comes out dry, it will make an ok cake but not awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another reviewer had a problem with the cake sticking.  We have never had that problem.  We grease and dust the pan with flour.  It always comes out very easy.  We normally take the cake out while still warm.  But we have taken it out almost directly out from the oven and also over an hour latter.  We do run a rubber spatula around the sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have never reviewed a recipe before.  Will likely never do so again.  But this cake is so good I felt guilty not telling everyone that this is the one recipe they should keep and cherish..  Make this cake!  You will love it."

I&#039;ve tried quite a few, including Martha Stewart&#039;s, and this one is far and away the moistest and chocolatiest chocolate cake out of them all.  Nice bonus that it&#039;s so easy to make, and doesn&#039;t call for any uncommon ingredients so no special grocery shopping trip needed.  A fabulous tasting cake I can whip up at a moment&#039;s notice with things I already have on hand?  LOVE THAT.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe."
1803739482,507451,2015/2/2,0,I made the Hershey&#039;s Perfectly chocolate cake to have for the Super Bowl/father in laws b-day on 2/1/15 and the cake was the best chocolate cake I have ever had and every single one of my guests told me how much they loved it and I was passing the recipe forward! I made a peanut butter frosting instead of the typical chocolate and it was so good! I will make this chocolate cake again! It is easy and doesn&#039;t take long!
2000277487,507451,2015/6/18,5,"I made this chocolate cake with the Hershey&#039;s Perfectly Chocolate Icing and it tasted amazing, by far the best cake I have ever tasted. I am new to making cakes, so I am trying to find the best recipes for the future, this is definitely number 1. Very rich, sweet, and just, amazing!

2000330782,496067,2015/7/12,1,"This is not right.  No unit of measure [UM] for the granulated garlic can lead one to assume a lack of a proofreader. Following the recipe as written and guessing the garlic UM cannot justify the volume of salt compared to the other ingredients. Using the list of ingredients as a starting point I developed this recipe instead. It is very close to the blend that we enjoyed at Elote Cafe in 2013 and that compelled us to seek out the recipe. One star only because the ingredients list was the starting point for a really good popcorn spice blend.

The version here has altered the recipe taken from the internet. 2015 July 04

We also used 40g of muscavado sugar, because there was enough sweetness for us from the honey. Really easy to make, super quick, and sweet. We made them for a football tournament tomorrow, to give all the players some good energy rather than sweets and chocolate."
542159,517874,2015/3/22,5,Linky like you I love Caprese salad and love avocados so figured I would give this a try and boy oh boy am I glad I did as it was yummy. I cut the recipe down to serve one and served with some warm fresh bread. Thanks so much for the post.

I may have baked it a little too long - when I stuck in the toothpick, I must have hit a raspberry b/c the toothpick was damp, so I baked it for 5 min. more. 20 min would have been fine!

I think that was my fault for using bone in thighs.....next day after reheating the chicken was nice and tender and even more flavorful!! Thanks for posting!"
88099,506965,2014/4/20,4,This was a very nice side dish to go with some chicken and potatoes and I can imagine many other dishes or just a snack.  Loved the flavor but a little garlic would have been a nice addition.  I was surprised that the veggies didn&#039;t have to be drained of water but they worked fine without doing that.  I did use a little more bread crumbs than called for and I don&#039;t know that that did anything or not.  Turned a nice golden brown in about 5 minutes per side.  Got 9 pancakes.

2000129993,513787,2015/4/10,0,"I tried this soup the other day and it was very tasty. I kind of switched some ingredients, instead of vegetable stock I just added 3 cans of chicken stock all together (it turned out to be the perfect amount for the ingredients) I also added 2 peppers, one red and one orange. At the end instead of using crackers I used garlic croutons, this soup had plenty of flavor and a bit of heat. (My fam also loved it) I will be making this in the future. :)"
2312817,513787,2015/9/29,3,"Actually more characteristic of southwestern and south-central Louisiana, is rural Creole jambalaya, which contains no tomatoes (the idea being the farther away from New Orleans one gets, the less common tomatoes are in dishes).  I added a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes undrained, and it came out delicious!"
852554,504737,2013/8/21,5,I made this with yellow beans instead and we loved it! We were getting a little tired of the &quot;harvest&quot; and this was a perfect change-up.  Made for ZWT 9

I did add an extra 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg in addition to the pumpkin pie spice.   While I don&#039;t necessarily think this has a pumpkin taste, it does have a great warm spiced flavor that just makes you think of autumn and pumpkin pie."

2324285,506268,2013/9/17,4,"Very good, and easy to throw together.  I used more curry paste, and used fresh oyster mushrooms instead of the canned straw mushrooms (I hate the taste of canned mushrooms).  Served over rice noodles, which soaked up the creamy sauce perfectly."
1052873,506979,2013/11/23,3,"Tasty, but incredibly messy to eat. Good under ice cream! Followed as written but wasn&#039;t sure about the layers of brownie batter and pretzels. I made it like lasagna - 1/3 brownie, row of pretzels, 1/3 brownie, row of pretzels, and brownie, but I think it needed more brownie on top. Also I probably would break up the pretzels some and use thicker caramel than the smucker&#039;s ice cream topping I used."
222478,495453,2013/5/4,5,Quick and delicious! I used some home grown garlic chives and a generous amount of cracked black pepper that gave it a wonderful tang.

305531,527462,2016/7/27,5,"Such a simple but good recipe. I had a little bit of linguica left so made myself an appetizer portion. Thanks for sharing, momaphet. Made for CQ3 - Azores."
2597942,498673,2013/5/20,5,"I made this for hubby today (I can&#039;t eat fish). He loved them! He said definately 5 stars. The only thing I did differently was that I had Tilapia filets I needed to use up. So I made the 4 Tilapia filets, per instructions, and stacked 2 on each toasted bun. They didn&#039;t take as long to fry as directed, because they were so thin. The mayo/wasabi spread is wonderful (that I did try, and the lettuce). I want to make breaded chicken breast and use that spread (and I don&#039;t really care for wasabi). He also liked the shredded, wilted lettuce. The panko didn&#039;t stay on too well during frying, I think next time I will dredge the filets in cornstarch before the egg wash and see if that helps it stick. Thank you for a great recipe. (Made for PRMR)"
126440,498673,2013/5/21,4,"Wasn&#039;t sure about the sauce but after resting for a couple hours, it was great with the sandwich.  &lt;br/&gt;I did dip in flour first before egg and soy and then panko and had no problems with crust staying on."
226863,498673,2013/6/23,5,"Since I had a thick piece of amberjack, I let my fish rest in the egg/soy mixture so it could absorb some of the flavor of the soy.  I had no problem getting the panko to stick to the fish, but I kind of pressed it on.  Loved the wasabi mayo, although I increased the amount of wasabi paste quite a bit.  The only part of the sandwich I didn&#039;t really care for was the lettuce, and that was probably my fault.  I didn&#039;t have any iceberg lettuce and used romaine.  The dressing on the lettuce made it sort of limp, and I think the iceberg would make for a nice crisp lettuce. So rating this a five based on the fish and the wasabi mayonnaise. Thanks for sharing!  Made for Rookie Tag game."
895132,498673,2014/7/18,5,"Delicious! I used ground unsweetened corn flakes for the panko breading, tamari for the soy sauce and a gluten free bun, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Oh, and I added a splash of agave nectar to the wasabi mayo because for some reason my wasabi paste turned out quite bitter (I used wasabi powder and added water). DH immediately said &quot;5 stars&quot; which he doesn&#039;t do often, mostly it&#039;s &quot;well, 4 1/2 I think...&quot; LOL This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing :)"
145352,508615,2014/3/31,5,This was delicious!!!
1802639878,515009,2014/4/6,5,"Has no one else tried this recipe?? This is fantastic!  None of the recipes using 5 ingredients use a lot of fresh ingredients (it&#039;s all frozen, canned, etc.) and between the chorizo and the fresh onion and avocado this recipe is DELICIOUS!  I made a whole pan of it instead of cakes but I am liking the idea of little hashbrown cakes for when company comes over."
1802623856,515009,2014/4/6,5,"As a cook, I&#039;m all about combinations of flavors, mixing fresh ingredients with easy ingredients, and making it simple because I have kids and don&#039;t have time for involved recipes anymore. I read the last review and agreed that I was surprised this wasn&#039;t reviewed before because it is absolutely delicious.  My husband loved it, my kids loved it, and I loved it...that never happens. I am always happy to try recipes with chorizo so good job chef...this was a great recipe."
1802646184,515009,2014/4/6,5,LOVE chorizo!!  Searched for some recipes with chorizo on here and didn&#039;t want a casserole or bake.  This one fit the build.  As some of the other reviewers said it had some fresh ingredients which is important to me.  I made several of these for a brunch with friends and was nervous trying a new recipe but everyone loved it...love when that happens!
1019994,507726,2016/4/16,4,This was great.  I added a chopped stalk of celery to complete the trinity and used one can of mild rotels and one can of regular.  Rotel tomatoes do pack a bit of heat so beware.
2000435540,509467,2015/8/31,5,I made these Thai Fish Cakes for a starter at a dinner party and everyone said they were the best they&#039;d had. They are easy to make and I will definitely be making them again.
2001858487,509467,2017/12/14,0,Its winter here in France !! Any ideas for the best substitute for green beans ? Would love to make these for Christmas eve party
768828,493158,2013/2/11,5,This was really good.  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and think it would be really good with olives or pickles.  I am using it as a sandwich spread.
452355,493158,2013/2/27,4,"DH liked this a little better than I did. The walnuts just did not do it for me, despite my reducing to 1/3 cup.  I used regular mayo so it would be vegetarian, not vegan.  I added fresh dill (very good addition), dried mustard, and madras curry powder, all of which helped.  I also added a couple of large fresh scallions as recommended.  I tried adding pickle relish and Dijon to my portion, but it did not add or detract.  We served in lavash as sandwiches.  Made for Sun and Spice 2013."
169430,493158,2013/5/10,5,"Photo may be seen here in Savor: www.annacia.com. Love this! I&#039;m enjoying it as lunch in a bowl. I used fat free thick yogurt, used a large scallion and went with the capers but I do think that green olives would be excellent too. Very quick and easy to make. This is a win-win recipe on all fronts. Made for February Sun and Spice in the North African/Middle East forum."
266635,506891,2013/11/16,5,"Excellent salsa!  The tequila is a must in this dish as it really adds a unique flavor and don&#039;t forget the salt which enhances the overall flavor of the salsa.  Unfortunately, I could not find a fresh pineapple that suited me so I did use canned pineapple chunks and only used green jalapeno. I can&#039;t wait to make this with fresh pineapple.  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
1802620945,504831,2014/3/26,0,"Loved this so much I signed up just to rate and review! Used natural low-fat yogurt, halved the recipe as only for two people, and used a tea-towel-lined small basket as a banneton for proofing. Fantastic rich almost sourdough-y flavour and super-soft light crumb. Because we prefer a thin light crust rather than the heavier artisan-style crust, I baked with an oven tray directly above and a pan of boiling water below to help it to cook through without the crust browning too fast and thickening. Took them out with 5 minutes to go, and perfect thin crust. So delicious."
895132,493713,2013/4/22,5,"Excellent dish! Made it as written, no changes, and we both loved it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for your win on the Healthy Choices Superfood Special February/March 1013"
305531,502747,2013/7/19,5,Wonderful! I soaked some wooden skewers and broiled these and we loved them. The combination of the meats and veggies was great and the sauce was so good on these. Thanks Mikekey for sharing. Made for ZWT9.
226863,502747,2013/9/15,5,"Delicious! My sauce didn&#039;t really thicken up, so I used it as a dipping sauce.  Everything about this recipe was perfect!  Thanks for sharing! Made for Football Tag 2013."
1436160,502747,2014/2/2,4,"These were very tasty. We really loved the kebabs. I believe the sauce needs some adjustments. I didn&#039;t understand the expectation of reducing the stock to 1/2 cup in 2 minutes. I boiled the stock/mustard for 10 minutes and it may have been reduced by 1/2. Next time I think I would start with about half (3/4 cup) of the chicken stock called for in the recipe, so more of the mustard flavor would come out. I couldn&#039;t find creole mustard, so I substituted coarse ground mustard.Thanks for posting. Made for Best of 2013 tag."
266635,504083,2014/1/2,5,"Made this delicious dip yesterday and it was sooo good.  How can you go wrong with all these wonderful ingredients.  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of hot sauce -- we like spicy, but I was afraid it would be too much.  Next time I&#039;ll put the full amount as I think we can take it : ).  Served this dip with some organic blue corn tortilla chips (my fav).  We&#039;ll be heating and reheating this yummy dip until we scrape the final bits from the casserole dish. : )  Made for PRMR, January, 2014."
157167,503755,2013/7/16,5,"These are great shortbread cookies!  The powdered sugar and butter whipped up easily by hand, so I didn&#039;t even have to pull out my mixer.  I made a half batch, and omitted the 1/2 egg yolk (really, that would have been strange to try and measure!) but I added a tsp of water to make up for the missing liquid - they held together fine without the egg.  For ZWT9"
2206320,494972,2013/2/10,0,YUM!!  These sound delicious!

1592049,494972,2013/2/12,5,Delicious!! Love All These Flavors ..YUM :)
2414156,494972,2013/2/12,5,Fabulous! I love enchiladas and these are fabulous!
2192609,494972,2013/2/12,5,"What a fabulous, delicious twist on the traditional enchilada!!!"
2677925,494972,2013/2/13,5,Great chicken ranchilada recipe.  Yum!!
2200666,494972,2013/2/23,0,I just had to try this recipe as I am a huge fan of enchiladas!  Love the twist you put on the classic and who would have thought of putting ranch inside and on top?  My family loved this as well as I did.  Think we have a new family favorite here.
2420655,494972,2013/2/24,5,We made this a couple of days ago... it was wonderful! xo
654393,494972,2013/2/24,5,"Being in Texas, I love an enchilada and this gives me another twist to a classic. Must try this one!"
2708802,494972,2013/2/24,5,Made these for dinner last night and they were a big hit - will definitely make them again.
2708825,494972,2013/2/24,0,My wife made these for dinner last night and they were delicious - I will be requesting them again in the future!

1767993,494972,2013/3/24,5,"Tried last night to take to a friend&#039;s home and all 4 of us loved it.  It was different than the usual enchiladas and my husband doesn&#039;t even like enchiladas and loved this recipe.  Well worth the $5,000 prize ----------------------"
1224106,494972,2013/3/25,0,"I really wanted to try this recipe, but over 1300 mg of sodium, and 23 gm of fat in one enchilada was a definite no. I&#039;ll bet they are delicious though. Hope somebody comes up with a healthy version of this."
122276,494972,2013/4/4,3,"I really wanted to like this and just now re-read the recipe to make sure I made it correctly.  I was left with the feeling that something was missing...  my sweetie didn&#039;t like them either, sorry :("
1535,494972,2013/5/7,4,"Nice comfort food for a chilly, rainy evening. A little too spicy for my liking, but I&#039;m a wimp. The rest of the family enjoyed them. The ranch flavor was a nice addition. My daughter prepared them and had no trouble following the recipe. We served them with Recipe #52177."
1706426,499452,2013/5/4,5,"Very delicious! Nice texture differences, I used spinach, but your choice would be great too, GailAnn! Thanks for posting!"
865936,502912,2013/8/1,4,This is a meal in itself.  What could be easier than just plopping everything in your rice cooker?
599450,502912,2013/8/4,5,"Delicious and pretty! Another great Dienia recipe! Made as directed for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
2002062162,534549,2018/3/19,4,"Used half the amount of dates, 1/4 loquat and 1/4 of crushed roasted nuts (hazel and peanuts). Instead of brown I used white sugar but reduced the amount. I did not have xanthan gum so I left it out which was no problem. Lovely recipe, thanks :)...."
1226388,502912,2013/8/8,5,"This is a great recipe for many reasons!  I make a similar recipe, but it is ore tomato based and has a lot more spices, and I make it in the oven.  When I was making it, I was itching to put in some chili powder and cumin, but I decided to leave out the spices and make it the way it was posted.  I am glad I did!  First of all, it is really tasty just as it is!  My son gave it thumbs up! And the other reason is that it is such a great base recipe!  I can see taking it in all kinds of directions. I was thinking that sweet potato and chicken would be great to add, also some greens like spinach or chard, and even pineapple would be great!  This would even be really good with curry added, or Moroccan spices.  Thanks for posting it!  Made for ZWT9"
80353,503144,2013/8/1,5,"OMG!  This was just superb!  I went to the fishmonger this morning to pick out a piece of very fresh salmon so that the tartar would not suffer from an overly-fishy flavour.  The dressing is lovely and creamy and not overpowering of the fresh fish in any way although, truth be told, I did add way more lemon that what is called for in the recipe (I am Greek and do love to use lemon!).  The dill is the perfect herbal note for this refined dish.  Perfect cooling food to eat on a typically hot, Greek, summer day."
1803075886,518146,2014/8/27,5,There is a nice balance between the savory and the sweet in this dish. I really like this as a cheese course! You can have it for an appetizer or dessert!
1803079582,518146,2014/8/28,5,mm I wanna eat that! Gimme gimme!
1803081122,518146,2014/8/28,5,Love the play between the black cherries and the brie!
1803049454,518146,2014/8/30,5,Delish! :-)
2000747555,497149,2015/12/15,5,Best said .. Loved it!!! Used my own homemade spagetti sauce and used more than then the recipe stated.
266635,506355,2014/4/22,5,"Made this iced coffee this afternoon for a nice pick-me-up. : )  The only change I made was to use Truvia natural sweetener vs. the sugar.  Will definitely keep this handy.  Made for Spring PAC, 2014."
135470,513435,2014/7/31,3,"This was my first time cooking quinoa. We all liked the texture but I found the flavor to be a bit one note. If I made this again I would saute the onion, add garlic and cumin and reduce the chili powder a bit."
169430,513435,2016/10/7,5,I made this for dinner last evening and I loved it with a poached egg on top and a drizzle of Franks Red Hot Sauce (I love that stuff!). A hot side salad of broccoli and cauliflower with herb vinaigrette completed a lovely meal for a very chilly fall evening.
226867,518158,2017/9/13,5,"I confess - I didn't make the black bean salad and instead, served this with left-over central American slaw -pretty much same ingredients except cabbage instead of beans. Anyway, the fritters were excellent and really quite easy. I used less oil than called for and that worked for me."
2002250938,535337,2018/8/18,3,It could have used 2 cups of flour did not Brown it was okay but soggy
266635,498135,2013/4/12,5,"Delicious cookies, but they do take time to make and assemble.  This is a great recipe for a cookie tray, gift or special occasion.  Made for Spring PAC, April, 2013."
306216,495218,2013/2/12,5,"I liked this very much! Wasn't dry ,very moist and the flavors all blended very well together.My family really enjoyed this."
28177,493141,2013/1/19,5,"Thankfully, mom is in town to de-bone the chicken thighs for me.  Eek!  Of course, she no longer eats meat.  So, we made this recipe with half the ingredients, but forgot to adjust the cooking time accordingly.  Our chicken was overcooked, and the thin-sliced potatoes crunched like potato chips, but the flavor of this dish was incredible!  The combination of smoked paprika, fresh lemon zest, and green olives was SO good.  Mom even tried it.  I'll definitely be making this again, but will not overcook the food next time.  :)  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Katie!"
191533,493141,2014/1/29,5,"Wow, this is WONDERFUL! Thanks for sharing! I cut the recipe in half for the two of us, and only used 1 9oz. chicken breast and 2 medium red potatoes. I sliced a pocket in the 2 pieces of the chicken breast, which worked very well. I was doubtful about the potatoes and chicken actually getting done at the same time, but it almost worked! I suggest putting the sliced potatoes in about 15 minutes ahead of time, then putting the stuffed chicken and sliced onions (and I added a cup of fresh broccoli) on the tray for the remaining time. Oh, and I didn&#039;t need all the paprika paste on the chicken, so I added a bit more oil to it and brushed it over the potatoes and veggies. Great, flavorful dish!"
2785432,493141,2016/9/26,0,"Sorry Alton, but I have to give this recipe a thumbs down!! I have tried many of your recipes and normally find them great, but after following your recipe to a T I was very underwhelmed at the lack of flavor. It smelled great but the flavor was lacking. I think I'd add lipton's onion soup mix to the potatoes and dice the onions instead of slicing them. Also might try add the onion soup mix to the olive stuffing, that might help. Sorry again cause I'm a big fan but this one is a fail."
2002292464,493141,2018/10/5,5,"So I made this last night and it was really tasty. I did take salt and pepper my chicken directly (and I used salt free seasoning from the dollar tree), I also used regular paprika and I only had limes ?? so that's what I used... I'm lazy so I left the bones in and put the olive mixture under the skin. Served it with sweet potatoes and sauteed kale."
128473,497615,2014/5/7,5,"Wow, was this good.  So many complex flavors blending together to create a superb dish.  We really enjoyed this flavorful exotic soup.  It had a lovely curry oil topping that blended into the soup giving it a little bite.  The prevalent flavor was the fish sauce.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I would make again.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
2891068,501547,2013/7/9,5,Substituted beef and didn&#039;t use all the veggies.  Also used nuoc mam instead but really enjoyed the marinade.
2000054022,499536,2015/6/13,5,"My family loves this! I double it now, my son eats all of it!"
2000696595,524809,2015/11/25,4,A great dish for cold days!
1592049,524809,2015/11/25,5,So Awesome Delicious ! Love the Combination of Yummy Flavors :)
2000694654,524809,2015/11/25,5,Great winter comfort food!
2000440320,499536,2015/8/30,4,"I love the flavor but at 6 hrs, it burns every time. What am I doing wrong?"
2570043,499536,2013/9/19,5,This is one our family favorites.  The end result is beautiful And tasty!
2000884503,499536,2016/2/21,5,"This recipe is awesome! It IS a little spicy for those who don&#039;t usually enjoy &#039;eating the heat&#039;, but it&#039;s GOOD! You can cut it to a 1/2 tsp. The first time I made it, it was so tender that it started to come apart in the pot..that&#039;s a good thing! First, I put some sauce in the bottom, then chicken, then the rest of the sauce..an hour on high, then I turn it down to low for another four hours..when the times up and it started to come apart an idea hit me..duhhh!! Shred it! So, this is what we&#039;re having today..Sweet Baby Rays jerk chicken on Hawaiian rolls...mmmmmmm...it&#039;s so good!"
2001495074,499536,2017/4/25,5,The best chicken but I use the highs family loves it we make it to mouth
2092116,499250,2014/1/16,5,excellent! good and has a kick of spicy
128473,503982,2013/7/26,5,"So very, quick, easy and delicious.  Wow, three ingredients they really made this meal sing.  Beautiful, big, juicy, spicy shrimp.  We really enjoyed the shrimp prepared this way.  What a great meal we had,  I served this with a simple salad and recipe #440040.  Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.  Made for ZWT9."
2447363,519085,2017/8/20,0,OMG! This is so yummy---Love it!
369715,497465,2013/5/24,4,We enjoyed this as a side dish. I only used two tablespoons of butter because 1/2 cup seemed like way too much. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. We all liked this.
58104,495170,2013/3/20,5,So easy and so yummy! Chocolate and nanas so good! Tender moist and flavorful.
2776160,495170,2013/4/8,0,This is the best vegan banana bread I have tried. Will be my no. 1 for sure
2243677,495170,2013/6/7,5,"Easy recipe. Substiuted gluten free flour, and it was AMAZiNG! &lt;br/&gt;One tip: don&#039;t over beat the batter. It toughens the bread. Learned this on the first try."
465911,495170,2013/9/16,5,"My kids loved this recipe. Really easy to make... my girls did most of the work. We changed the recipe into muffins, because we have a birthday coming up and there is a little girl coming who is allergic to eggs. Followed directions as written, then divided into muffin tin and baked somewhere between 18-22 minutes. Thanks!!"
1802894147,495170,2015/2/19,1,Didn&#039;t work out. Cake came out totally dry.

2001554231,495170,2017/5/25,5,"Fresh out of the oven, followed the recipe and hope it tastes as good as it looks, yum!"
369715,496193,2013/6/17,4,I made this for Sunday breakfast. I followed the recipe except I used eight eggs instead of six. I also added a good bit of salt and pepper. We all enjoyed this.
1900301,507629,2016/1/20,5,I regularly cook homemade pizzas.  This is the best pizza to ever exit our oven!  My husband and daughter (not mushroom fans) even scarfed this baby down.  I used our favorite pizza crust and doubled the roasted garlic sauce and shredded mozzarella.  The flavor was amazing!
199848,498820,2013/10/20,5,"Wow, this was rich and delicious!  I saw the recipe and thought how could this not be great?  It was great!  It may seem like a bit much blue cheese, but the amount is just right.  I made this exactly as written.  I would love this as a Thanksgiving side dish.  Thanx for sharing!"
169430,502740,2013/8/4,5,"Mmmmmm, rather creamy, fruity and a real pleasure. This was a perfect beverage to go along with my Scotch Bonnet heated main this evening. I made the full amount and drank almost all of it. I will make and enjoy this again even without a fiery dinner plate."
107583,502740,2013/8/7,5,Very refreshing.  I just put everything in the blender and gave it a whirl for about 10 seconds.  Made for ZWT 9.

570804,497818,2013/7/8,5,My goodness this is the ultimate in cranberry bread.....................highly recommend if you really want a treat and wonderful for gift giving.
2000722250,502740,2017/7/12,5,we love this as our beachy mocktail for our corporate picnics all summer long!
2001221288,527534,2018/6/22,5,"Sounds good. Like the idea of Stevia. What if I use a different fruit, like mango?"
2002186738,527534,2018/6/22,0,"I am at Starbucks now, going to buy Vanilla yogurt, and also cut out the sugar and put a bit of honey or Stevia. Already have frozen strawberries. Would like to try with my organic frozen blueberries too. Marilyn"
2865341,500833,2013/6/16,5,"I LOVE this recipe! Being vegan, I never have the opportunity to enjoy spinach and artichoke dip. This recipe is perfect - the dip is flavorful and creamy, and my non-vegan friends even love it! Nutritional yeast flakes and tofu are high in protein and low in fat. In a typical spinach and artichoke dip, you get a lot of fat with little protein. So even if you aren&#039;t vegan, I would highly recommend going this route for a dip like this!"
1803250485,500802,2014/10/21,5,"I absolutely LOVE this recipe and it has become a staple.  I&#039;ve been making it once a week and freeze it for reheating in microwave.  I prefer jalapenos, but have thrown in red bell peppers with good results.  I&#039;ve also used canned tomatoes.  I&#039;ve used half butter/half oil.  I just picked up any kind of feta cheese and also tried blue cheese.  (Feta is the best.)  This is a surprisingly good, healthy, flavorful dish considering the ingredients.  I usually miss having a chicken/beef broth base for flavor in vegetarian dishes, but this one is incredibly flavorful!  It&#039;s easy to adjust the &quot;heat&quot; by saving a section of veins/seeds and adding it &quot;to taste&quot;.    Even my 90 year old &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; Mother is making this dish.  I also tried it vegan and it is good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can&#039;t say enough about it.  It is also easy to tweak.  Easy, Healthy, Tasty!  Best recipe I&#039;ve found in years!"
2001392624,500802,2017/2/15,4,"just returned from Bhutan where this is served regularly in varying forms. good appetizer, side dish, snack. Mushrooms rather than tomatoes common or just the cheese and chilis. ranges also from thick (nacho style) cheese to just a bit in the sauce. this recipe is in between. Good to have an actual recipe."
305531,503094,2013/8/8,5,"I was intrigued with this recipe as I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had pimientos in potatoes before. I made 1/2 the recipe with a mixed cheese blend. I baked these in a small round souffle type dish. The recipe does not say what temperature to cook these, so I baked them at 350F for the times given. My potatoes weren&#039;t even close to being done in this time frame, so I think that the temp either needs to be higher, or that they need more time in a dish that isn&#039;t as deep. I cooked them for close to an hour. We both loved these creamy potatoes with our meal. Thanks Dee for sharing. Made for ZWT9."
169430,503137,2014/2/21,5,"Loved This bread. It came out crisp and delicious. We dipped it into soup and scooped carrot salad with it. This made a healthy, yummy and fun addition to to our Moroccan meal. I really loved that it was baked and not fried. The Khobz was a hit with everyone except my DH but then he doesn&#039;t like much of anything so please don&#039;t count that against the recipe at all."
242729,503137,2014/3/9,5,Made exactly as posted with the addition of some black mustard seeds for an extra taste and flavour! Served with Recipe #503143 for lunch and such an easy bread recipe thanks! Made for Aussie/Kiwi Recipe Swap #86. THANKS darlink! Karen/FT xxx
223441,524006,2016/4/8,4,Cooking directions were spot on. Used 8 oz of kale leaves. However I did use reg soy sauce which proved to be way too salty. will try again with low sodium soy sauce as directed in the recipe.
2827062,497505,2013/5/15,4,"My daughter (gluten sensitive) loved this sauce tonight. I added to this recipe: 10 oz low fat milk, 2 oz of fat free cream cheese, 1 Tbs of sodium free chicken bouillon, 1 tsp Mrs Dash Garlic &amp; Herb, &amp; 1/2 tsp celery seed, in a sauce pan, heating until melted and thickened, and poured it over browned chicken pieces. Made a nice Gluten Free, Low Sodium Chicken &amp; Rice dish. I made this with the gluten free flour and thought it was a little too flour-y tasting. Next time I&#039;ll try it with 1/2 flour and 1/2 corn starch."
2625272,497505,2014/2/25,5,I make this with corn starch instead of the flour substitute and it turned out perfect. I also use 3/4 milk and 1/4 cup (or a little more) chicken stock instead of the bouillon since I can&#039;t find a bouillon without sugar.
941390,497505,2014/4/17,5,This was much better than I had expected!  I was afraid it might be runny and make the casserole runny but it was very thick.  My daughter and son-in-law actually thought the baked chicken salad casserole tasted better with this than it usually does with the soup!  And the grandkids didn&#039;t know anything was different about it. :)
2001845788,497505,2017/12/8,0,So which do you think worked better? The GF flour or the cornstarch?
2000156457,521787,2015/4/21,5,These are delicious!!!! Wonderfully tangy and sweet.
2001724962,521829,2017/9/25,5,Excellent recipe! I LOVE the Short Smoked salmon at Sweetwater Tavern and this is just like it! The skin stuck to the paper and beautiful fillets come of with ease. This will be my protien for my salads all week!
482376,503069,2013/8/4,5,"Outstanding soup! This recipe really surprised me. I expected to like it, but I love it!! Absolutely delicious. Great flavors. I love the mixture of beans and the veggies. The coconut milk is so delicious when added to the soup. The only change I&#039;ll make next time is to omit the lime addition at the end. I tasted the soup before adding the lime and then after, and actually liked it without the lime better!  I&#039;ll make this soup again, for sure. Thanks! Made for ZWT9 Caribbean for the Soup-A-Stars."
37449,504183,2013/8/22,5,These make great little snacks! I enjoy the Middle Eastern flavors. Thanks Mikekey! Made for ZWT 2013 for team Hot Stuff.
131126,504183,2013/8/22,5,I made these early in the day and by dinnertime they already had absorb enough of the spices to make them special. I can only imagine how much better they will be tomorrow.  I did add a twist of lemon peel. Thank you for sharing the recipe!
128473,504183,2015/3/27,5,Awesome recipe Mike.  5 stars all the way.  Who knew they could taste like this.  Thank you for sharing a new family favorite.  Made FYC Tag Game.
593927,495041,2013/3/6,5,"Great quinoa recipe. I used light tasting extra virgin olive oil, organic green onion, sea salt, to taste, organic red quinoa (my favourite for the texture), water, unsalted raw pistachios, plus the rest of the ingredients. I would make this again. Made for Healthy Choices Tag Game 2013."
174096,501147,2013/6/21,4,"Flavorful and delicious dish!  We enjoyed these stuffed peppers and the little zip from the jalapeno and pepperjack, and packed full of veggies.  Thanks for sharing!  Good luck in the contest!"
37449,501147,2013/6/21,5,"I halved the recipe and enjoyed for dinner. I broiled the peppers on low about 12 minutes and used fire roasted tomatoes with green chilies, so left out the jalapeno. I used mozzarella on top. Delicious.Thanks!"
58104,501147,2013/6/21,5,"I must say Poppers here in the US are small peppers that are hollowed out, stuffed and breaded then deep fried baked or grilled. With a sauce on the side. So I was a little surprised to see pablanos as the main pepper being stuffed. I would have understood these as stuffed peppers better. I did love your intro so I had to make these. I made 1/2 the amount and had extra filling. I  stove top roasted the jalapeno and pablanoes then placed into a bag to sweat. Removed the charred skin and inners. Leaving us with tender peppers and no skin (Which is the cause for burping):) Very good! 4 for recipe and for the great intro a 5 star recipes"
131126,501147,2013/6/23,5,I thought this was flavorful and the stuffed peppers reminded me of a chili relleno (without the breading.)  I liked the veggie loaded stuffing and plan to try it in a bell pepper too. Great intro and good use of the contest ingredients! Good luck!
169430,504281,2015/3/11,5,I cut the recipe in half and made enough little cookies to last me for about a month tucked in the freezer. Of course I had to sample and keep some handy for a bit. Delicious! for my sample I had 3 (I started with 2) cookies with a glass of almond milk and was in nut heaven. They are tender but nowhere near falling apart.  Great flavor and certainly nice enough looking for that cookie tray that we make every year. :D
133174,517622,2014/8/9,5,This soup was made for the Culinary Quest Soups On Challenge.  I&#039;m not sure if I have ever had borscht every and am not sure what I was expecting.  The recipe was adapted for the slow cooker.  The onions and garlic were browned in oil and the chicken tossed and browned lightly.  The beets were roasted and peeled.  I wasn&#039;t sure how grated carrots and beets would do over an extended cook time so I opted to dice them.  The water was reduced to 1 quart.  The beets and beans were added the last 30 minutes or so in order for the flavors to meld.  The only thing I would recommend is to pre-cook the chicken and add at the same time the beets and beans were added.  My chicken was a little dry.  No fault of the recipe just a conversion error on my part.  The soup was cooked on medium to low heat and was ready in about 3 1/2 hours.  Fresh dill was used in the soup and additional used as a garnish.  Really good.
2000276418,502348,2016/2/10,4,This recipe is easy and delicious! Thank you!
2731384,497015,2013/3/10,5,I am in crab dip heaven right now. So good just spooning it out of the dish.
2725770,497015,2013/3/11,5,i bet the hash browns add a nice texture to this crab dip that you don't have with most similar dips.  sounds yummy!
1803335367,517553,2014/11/13,5,"This recipe sounds delicious, and I intend to try it.  But those on a low carb diet should note that the carbs in the 13 packets of Truvia in the recipe are not included in the nutritional facts.  Be aware that each packet of Truvia contains 3 gms of carbohydrate for a total of 39 grams in the entire recipe.  Using organic Truvia with natural Inulin will total less than 13 grams of carbs plus some fiber.  Kudos to food.com for counting them separately so that adjusting the nutritional count is easy!"
1803445762,517553,2015/11/11,0,"I was going to try these until I saw the truvia, I do not use artificial sweeteners. Perhaps if they made it with honey instead."
1802197444,506483,2014/1/11,1,"If you&#039;re considering trying this, don&#039;t bother. The steak was WAY overcooked, and I had to put the potatoes in the microwave to finish cooking them. The corn was good, at least. I used fresh corn on the cob. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t try the frozen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My biggest regret was that I waited 6 hours for something I could have done in a half-hour, and it would have been much better. That time would be better spent letting the steaks marinate. Sorry, I love a crockpot, but this is just not good."
2000090092,506483,2015/3/26,5,My husband and I travel alot for work so we do alot of crockpot and microwave cooking. I let the steaks marinate overnight. The next morning I layered everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for 8 hours. All I can say is AWESOME!!! The steaks were so tender. It was the absolute best tasting and tenderest steaks we&#039;ve ever ate. The corn and potatoes turned out great too. Thanks so much for this recipe. We&#039;ll definitely be using it alot.
386585,513659,2014/3/11,5,"I was craving a nice, juicy steak.  It&#039;s been a long, long winter, and I&#039;ve not been able to get anywhere near my outdoor grill!  Rosie to the rescue!  I had some lovely strip steaks, about 1 lb. each and about 1 inch thick.  I did not pound them, since they were just the right thickness for us.  The onions and au jus were delicious and the perfect finishing touch!  I&#039;m so grateful that I can now enjoy perfectly cooked steaks in the cold weather months.  Thanks again, Rosie!"
379033,513659,2014/5/14,5,Thanks Rosie for suggesting this recipe to me. We really enjoyed it. I did add mushrooms to my onion Au Jus. We just love mushrooms with our steaks. This recipe is a keeper for when I don&#039;t feel like grilling. Thank you again!
128473,513659,2014/9/7,5,"I made this delicious dish tonight using sirloin tip steak. It was juicy and very tender.  We really enjoyed the steak prepared this way.  I served it with mushrooms, tomato slices, partisan bread and onion au jus.  Thank you for sharing this tasty meal.   Made for Culinary Quest 2014 - Suitcase Gourmets."
1803720169,513659,2015/1/28,5,Not much noise was heard at the dinner table with this one. I added mushrooms and minced garlic to my au jus. Thanks for sharing
2001588190,530370,2017/6/17,4,"From the mom: very fun cookies and they turned out pretty. Easy to make. I didn't care much for how they tasted but my 3 kiddos loved them. Definitely more of a kids treat. We only used mini semi-sweet chips, did not add in the vanilla chips. From my daughter: These are easy to make and super tasty, but super sweet. They were a big hit at my birthday party!!!"
163112,513585,2014/3/1,5,"Very fast, easy &amp; delicious!  Bananas are quite filling &amp; 1 16oz glass filled me up.  I used 2 skimpy TBs boring white sugar &amp; a small splash of my diminishing supply of vanilla extract.  I didn&#039;t use almond in case dd wanted some.  A great idea for a busy morning!  Made for A Culinary Tour of Yemen in the NA/ME Forum 2/14."
2324285,513585,2014/3/1,5,"Really tasty and easy.  I froze the bananas the day before, so when I blended everything together the drink had the texture of milkshake.  Just as good, but healthier!  I used about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, as my bananas were not very ripe.  I will probably make this again."
226863,513585,2014/3/29,5,"This was very good.  I made with one frozen banana, and used vanilla soy milk.  Delicious breakfast smoothie.  Thanks for sharing."
2001460711,519260,2017/9/11,5,These chicken tenders are fantastic. They are SO tender because of the sugar in the barbecue sauce.
2000348671,497865,2015/10/14,5,"This was SOOOO much easier than my usual way of pan-frying!!! We like our chicken extra-crispy so instead of mixing the panko into the mixture, I just combined the mayo and parmesan, painted my boneless, skinless, chicken thighs with the mixture, then rolled it in the panko. I seasoned both the chicken and panko with my favorite seasonings. Threw them on my circular air oven and they turned out fantastic!"
135760,495649,2013/2/17,0,"It looks like a lovely recipe but you may want to either rename it or substitute vegetarian broth for the chicken broth--if it has chicken broth, it's not vegetarian! Definitely be giving it a try with vegetarian broth :)"
2002267997,497496,2018/9/6,4,"I'm giving it four stars even though me and my husband didn't eat the pie we only each had like one piece one day and one the next and then we threw it out. The reason being is it was entirely too sweet and let me say we love sweet stuff I literally make homemade caramel to smother our pancakes in. It was just way too sweet. I threw it out to make my chocolate chess pie in replacement of it and that is a super sweet Pie... this was a disgusting sweet I don't know how to explain it , I would not suggest anyone make this I have read other recipes were people add softened cream cheese to the recipe I definitely plan on trying that I can see how it can make it be not so sweet but then again cream cheese is very rich."
369715,492889,2013/3/5,3,This was OK for us. It was good but a bit too sweet with the corn. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It is a thick meal. It also heated up nicely the next day as I took it for lunch.
114027,500391,2013/10/28,4,Great flavors...they really do remind you of apple pie. They did turn out a little dense but were overall very enjoyable. Great fall breakfast! Made for My Three Chefs 2013.
169430,507166,2014/5/8,5,"Oh Yes, this was a hot. I enjoyed sipping it while watching the most recent Hobbit movie this evening. Excellent flavor, creamy and smooth. Whats not to love? Made for PAC, Spring 2014."

169430,503970,2013/7/20,5,"Photo may be seen here, in Ingredients: www.annacia.com . Very simple to make from items that I always have on hand. I sampled it on a chicken sandwich for lunch and it added a very nice punch to the flavor. Thanks Nif :D. Made for ZWT 9"

128473,503970,2013/7/26,5,"I liked this Cajun spice blend very much.  It was quick and easy to make, with ingredients always found in my pantry.  It was very flavorful.

219942,503970,2018/8/15,5,Delicious spice blend! I ground the thyme and oregano with my mortar and pestle for more uniformity in the look of it. I'm going to make more so I can have it on hand whenever I need it!
246482,503970,2018/8/16,5,Made for Susies World tour 2018 a wonderful blend of spices for some kicking Cajun cooking
542159,503970,2018/8/26,5,Made for a recipe calling for Cajun Spice and this blend worked perfectly in my recipe. Thanks for the post.
204024,503970,2018/9/2,5,Great selection of flavors. This was very tasty in our Smothered Cube Steak recipe.
2000109317,505315,2015/4/2,2,"Timing is all wrong. Found another recipe that is almost the same on another website stating 15-17 minutes. Much closer to accurate. This is on a temperature tested oven, so it&#039;s not that mine is heating 50 degrees lower than it is supposed to. 

Additionally, and you can tell based on the smell in the oven way before you taste them, this make CHEESE STRAWS. Very different and not at all like Cheez Its."
80353,503931,2013/7/18,5,"This was delicious!  I really liked the blend of flavours (OK, bacon makes EVERYTHING taste better).  I wasn&#039;t sure that the okra wouldn&#039;t come out slimy cooked this way, but I used baby frozen, and they held up well."
174096,503931,2013/7/23,5,"Yum, this is so flavorful, and we enjoyed the kick created by the cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper.  This was my first time cooking with okra, and it worked out quite well.  This made generous portions; we are looking forward to the leftovers!  Thanks for sharing.  ZWT9"
143318,504749,2013/8/20,5,"Healthy, colorful and delicious; an easy every day summer salad."
2001015861,510239,2016/5/17,5,"Taste a lot like soft pretzels! I added dried mushroom powder, celery salt and parsley. Then boiled in water with bullion added. Excellent...my husband was dubious, but loved them! Thanks, easy to make and fun to eat as is."
2001427498,510239,2017/3/10,0,Just made these and they were absolutely great. The only complaint I have is that I didn't make more.
552864,494720,2013/2/10,5,"We must have the worlds smallest loaf pans... could explain a lot about my bread making abilities lol This was awesome! Made 2 loaf pans for us so we got 2 dinners and a lunch out of it. Will gladly make this again. Thank you again Sue for a great recipe, we really enjoyed it."
841895,494720,2013/7/22,4,"I think this recipe is a great starting point for a small lasagna for two, and I love how well the lasagna noodles fit the loaf pan. Next time, I think I&#039;ll do the layers differently so that the ricotta mixture and mozzarella are more evenly spread throughout the dish, but that is the only thing I would change. Thanks for a great recipe!"
280271,494720,2014/10/29,5,What an excellent dish!?there really is enough for 4 people?I made it for me and the hubby and there was plenty for lunch the next day?it?s very easy to prepare?I made it as posted with no changes?=) made for &quot;What&#039;s on the Menu&quot; tag game
2000488233,494720,2015/9/21,5,Wonderful recipe for two and then some! We enjoyed with some garlic knots.  Thanks.
2000579330,494720,2015/10/19,5,"This recipe is perfect for two with enough left over for lunch. It was really delicious  and easy to make. To save time, I bought ready-for-the-oven noodles. I also used sausage and tomato sauce instead since that&#039;s what I had on hand. I added about 8 oz of diced tomatoes and a small can of sliced black olives too."
2000793293,494720,2016/1/1,5,It&#039;s just me and my boyfriend and 2 dogs. Although I love lasagna I&#039;ve never made it for us and was happy to find this recipe for 2. I made it exactly as written and it was DELISH! It&#039;s really enough for 4. Thanks!
2001171733,494720,2016/9/17,5,"My husband wanted lasagna for dinner, and being empty nesters and not able to be home for leftovers, I looked for a lasagna for 2. Found this recipe and made it last night. And am I glad I made it! It was delicious!!! I usually make lasagnas where I don't have to boil the noodles, and do wish I could do that with this recipe. But other than that, it was easy to make and the perfect size for us. I used a spicy marinara sauce, which I think really added flavor. I also used Barilla's whole grain lasagna noodles. Will be making this lasagna a lot this fall and winter!!!"
2000751307,494720,2017/11/28,5,This is my new go to recipe for Lasagna! Love it!
2001967706,494720,2018/2/2,5,"Absolutely delicious! I added a layer of fresh spinach and used oven ready noodles. Still a lot of lasagna for two. But, we’ll figure out a way to finish it. I highly recommend this yummy recipe.!"
2002297430,494720,2018/10/10,5,"I've made this three times. It ain't fancy but it's good and easy. Two of the three times, I used cottage cheese in lieu of ricotta and no one noticed the difference. Once, I wilted and chopped up half a bag of baby spinach languishing in my fridge and stirred that into the cottage cheese mixture...also very good. My family of three gets a generous dinner out of it as well as some leftovers for lunch."
726538,507526,2013/12/23,5,Delicious!  But I&#039;m not sure where the total time of 45 minutes comes from when the dish has to spend 1.5 hours in the oven.
2000725491,524989,2015/12/2,5,This is an excellent mixture of both Joe&#039;s Special and spaghetti. My whole family loves it!
75160,496399,2015/7/25,3,I made these because I needed to use up some blackberries.  I like hearty muffins but these are  more chewy than even I like.  I used oil instead of applesauce.  I am going to make again and try changing it up.
2885913,502397,2013/7/1,5,Great. Easy to follow and make. Perfect to make during this heat wave. I added some fresh cucumbers from the garden. I think fresh blueberries would be a good addition.
12938996,502397,2013/9/18,5,"Amazing!  I&#039;ve made many spinach salads with fruit and chicken, but this one stands head and shoulders above them all.  This is now a family favorite.  I substitute other fruit if strawberries aren&#039;t available, and it&#039;s just as tasty. HIGHLY recommend giving this one a try!"
282842,502397,2016/5/11,5,"Big hit. Very flavorful, and if someone thinks they don't like kale, this should change their minds. Note, this recipe made a HUGE bowl; even as a main meal and big portions, with the bulk of the kale, barely made a dent in it. But that also makes it great for a potluck!"
126440,502397,2016/11/10,5,Made half a recipe for us and both of us loved it. Easy to do and great flavors.
350750,496399,2015/9/28,4,"I made these muffins the night before for breakfast, of course I had to sample one.  The recipe results in a moist and chewy muffin.  I subbed mulberries for blackberries.  Thank you!"
2292657,495792,2013/4/23,4,"Glad to see someone already put this recipe on here. A co-worker sent me this recipe by email yesterday, and it looked so good I made it last night. My hubby does not like quinoa but I love it, so this was just intended for me. That brings up a good point... If you do not like quinoa, you are not going to like this recipe. It is an unusual texture that some people just don&#039;t enjoy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made one major modification to cut the fat. Instead of pan frying, I put the cakes on a cookie sheet with cooking spray and baked them at 400 degrees, flipping once. I started off at 15 minutes, but ended up baking them for about 20 minutes. That might have been just a tad too long, but they did get a nice golden brown color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also made half with fontina and half with reduced fat feta. (I just love feta and thought that might be good too.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both tasted great! They were a little dry, but I know that has more to do with my cooking method. Next time, I may add another egg or some other form of moisture if I try baking them again. &lt;br/&gt;However, I will note that they seemed to have more moisture today as leftovers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will definitely make these again, and have already been thinking of other modifications and tweaks I can make. For example, I may cook the quinoa in vegetable broth next time, just to add some flavor."
2000172555,495792,2015/4/28,0,"Made this with a lot of alterations and it came out great! Added minced onions and garlic salt instead of scallions, grated zucchini, added 1/4 more cheese and an extra egg."
2000431901,495792,2015/8/26,4,"These were incredible! I followed the recipe completely with the exception of cooking my quinoa in homemade turkey stock. I was really skeptical about the amount of pepper in them, but we like spicy so I went with it, adding it a little at a time and tasting it as I went. My husband and I thought it was great, but my 2.5 year old (who was really excited to eat them) thought it was too much pepper and only took a couple bites. The aioli does help cut the spice but not enough for him.

Also, I have a pretty big food processor and the amount of aioli was too small for it to completely chop up the garlic. I will try making it in the blender next time.

We will definitely make these again. Nice main dish to use instead of meat."
2000444299,517370,2015/8/31,4,"My husband was stationed at Camp Hansen in 1988-89. We&#039;ve been trying to make Taco Rice for decades and this recipe is a winner! He remembers the original being a bit spicier but we added Sriracha sauce and that did the trick! Also, I used Dynasty Jasmine rice, from the ethic foods aisle in the grocery and just followed the package directions. It has a nice sticky texture. Excellent reproduction"
574936,517370,2016/11/9,5,"We were at Camp Hansen in 1989-90 and have been making this for years now. I couldn't use the two types of seasonings because only one is available. I also used a sticky rice. I made this one night, and thought, I wonder if anyone else has tried this fine cuisine. Aaah, memories."
2001398887,517370,2017/2/19,0,"Ah, but how do you get the chicken right?"
131126,497554,2013/3/27,5,"Amazing good and surprisingly easy!  What more do you need? I trimmed  fat from bone in country pork ribs, poured on the root beer, and  later removed the bone.  The meat before the bbq sauce addition was a surprise. It was sweet &amp; nicely flavored.  Adding the sauce made good bbq sliders served with Jalapeno Corn Slaw #468395. Was this &quot;true&quot; BBQ? No, but it&#039;s easy, requires few ingredients, and is GOOD.  That makes it a hit for my family. Thank you for sharing the recipe! Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef."
13593,497554,2013/7/20,5,Fantastic taste and easy to prepare for a busy day.  Thanks for sharing with us.  Who doesn&#039;t love root beer?
1800290124,497554,2013/12/1,5,I have made this 3 or 4 times in the last 6 months because my family loves it. I used sweet baby rays barbque sauce
2002248213,524289,2018/8/15,5,Amazingly delicious! My husband doesn’t like porch chops- he had 3!
2411534,494507,2014/3/20,5,"I made this today for my kids and I and it was delish. I did add two spoonfuls of plain greek yogurt to smooth out the consistency and a squirt of honey. The kids didn&#039;t even taste the spinach. Once I told them, they didn&#039;t care, they wanted more:)"
331472,494103,2015/12/1,1,"I&#039;m so sorry to leave a bad review, but these came out terribly. I had to throw them out.  I think you must have some mistakes in the ingredients: 1 teaspoon of sugar? For two whole cups of flour? And you left the butter out of the directions.."
29196,497067,2013/3/26,5,"We&#039;re happy little Vegemites tonight thanks Tis cos our dinner was delicious. It was so simple to put together, but SO good. You wouldn&#039;t know it was vegemite in the marinade (you might suspect miso or soy sauce) but as we love it we loved it. The coleslaw is worth making on it&#039;s own too. Thanks so much for posting!"
1677099,498781,2013/4/25,5,"This is a classy tasting cake.  The stars are for taste.  I used greek yogurt and mixed things out of order....yogurt then sugar, then butter then eggs then flour.  Added a pinch of salt.  Oiled a silicone fancy bunt pan. Had to cook 20 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  I tried to take it out while still warm and it broke apart  Reality is it stuck so badly it would not have mattered if I had waited until it cooled."
2000539188,515024,2015/10/8,3,I halved the recipe only making about 8 cookies. The texture is more of a bread than a cookie. It tasted like a bowl of plain oatmeal with raisins. Overall I was hoping for more flavor it was very bland. Next time I would definitely recommend adding some kind of sweetener.
2001381408,515024,2017/2/6,5,"I really liked these cookies, thank you for posting this recipe. They were perfect for my requirements, I found them just the right amount of sweetness, and it was a forgiving recipe. (I'm not a precise measurer, and my measuring cup is in UK vs. US units too.) Worked out really well, I'm making them a second time now."
280271,501838,2013/10/19,5,This is such a yummy dish! Not sure if I would rate it the best wings I&#039;ve ever ate...but it sure is close...I watched the video...and I also used the oyster sauce...I gotta say this is finger licking good...the sauce sticks to your fingers while you eat it...you really need to make sure that you emulsify the sauce at the end...that&#039;s what gives the wings the caramelizing effect...very yummy indeed...thanks for posting it...it&#039;s going in my best of 2013 cookbook...=)
286566,501838,2013/11/20,5,"Due to stove top restrictions I baked these in the oven, put them in a foiled lined tray and spooned the sauce over them and baked them in a 175C fan forced oven for 50 minutes for delicious and meat fall of the bones sticky wings and thoroughly enjoyed by us all, thank you Sharon123, made for Rookies tag game."
2901022,493833,2013/7/14,5,"Easy, tasted great, and got a lot of compliments. After hearing about all the bad stuff in jarred pasta sauces, I wanted to try making my own, but my image of the type of a person who made their own sauce was the Italian grandmother slaving away over a pot for hours, chopping, simmering, and waiting.  This sauce was nothing like that and turned out great.  It took no time at all and little prep.  Chose an onion, open a few cans, and throw in some dried spices. I&#039;ll never buy jarred sauce again.  I didn&#039;t have the rosemary or the red pepper, but I think the red pepper would have added a nice kick."
1802573705,493833,2014/3/11,5,Love the recipe. Had all seasonings needed in dried Italian seasoning. I added sweet Italian sausage and about half a Tbsp. of celery flake to it. Yum! Perfecto!
45610261,493833,2018/8/11,0,Great but I used Ketchup and fresh tomatoes along with lots of sweet bell peppers. Also put in some red wine vinegar. Yumm added a can of diced seasoned tomatoes.
2002256762,525403,2018/8/25,0,yummy
1802827485,507190,2014/6/15,5,Made this for dessert for Father&#039;a Day! It was amazing!!
487098,511888,2015/12/4,5,"Really easy and delicious!  Will need to get a better way to flip it over, as it ended up being a partial loaf and loaf chunks with my first attempt!"
1742193,497139,2013/11/23,5,This was absolutely delicous! The fish has so much flavor and it is so easy to do. My husband and I loved it!!  ( I used 1 teaspoon of dried parsley instead of fresh.) I will use this recipe probably every time I have cod!
37449,505527,2013/8/20,5,A nice mix of flavors and textures! Used to top your Tangled salad. I adjusted it to my tastes. Thanks twissis! Made for ZWT 2013 by one of the Hot Stuff.
418718,497382,2013/3/13,5,awesome recipe!!!
865936,501203,2013/11/15,4,"This recipe translates well and was unexpectedly delicious!  I did use some Peruvian olives in place of the green (don&#039;t ask).  This would be a lovely addition to a relish tray.  Made for MFO, November 2013."
945395,506260,2013/8/30,5,"I loved this potato salad! I&#039;ve been an underdog for Miracle Whip ever since I heard my own mother spew, &quot;When I think of Miracle Whip, I think of trailer trash&quot;. This is an excellent recipe!"
2935562,501028,2013/8/7,5,"We tried this chili tonight, and it was FANTASTIC! Not too spicy, not too mild. Although the addition of chocolate to the recipe sounds odd at first, I must say that it adds that little &quot;something&quot; that you didn&#039;t even know was missing! I would highly recommend this recipe!"
1800119725,501028,2013/10/26,0,We tried it last weekend and it the entire family loved it!  Spicy but not too spicy.  It is the best chili I&#039;ve ever tried.  Great Crock Pot recipe and the house smelled great while cooking!  Awesome!  In the process of cooking our second batch to take to a Halloween party tonight.
2002139966,527299,2018/5/5,1,This is a travesty to both the mint julep and the margarita. Sometimes less is more.
2002142031,527299,2018/5/5,0,I'll be making a mint julep for the Derby and later I'll do margaritas. This seems wrong... lol
1520738,497274,2017/2/6,5,"Really yummy. The biscuit topping was really great, I changed the filling a bit by cubing and freezing/thawing the tofu, giving it more of a traditional chicken pot pie feel."

47892,507236,2013/10/2,0,"Very yellow, very pretty! ~Tasty Dish~ devoured it! Served with chicken Sunday evening and soup tonight. I cheated (I do that often) and used the ABM to prep the dough. The recipe was also cut in half and I made two small loaves. Tasted good this morning toasted with a little bit of butter and to accompany scrambled eggs. Made for NA*ME Tag/September."
542159,507236,2013/10/12,5,The color and smell had me drooling before the first bite and oh what a yummy bite it was. Enjoyed the first with butter this morning it was ear marked for our dinner but by dinner time it was missing two pieces because I just had to have another with my lunch lol. I made using the fennel option and would like to try the caraway option next time. Thanks for wonderful post.
163112,507236,2013/11/17,5,"I did it!  I did it!!  Absolutely stunning &amp; delicious!!  I used fennel seeds instead of caraway.  I had no bread flour so used AP flour.  Only had 1/2c semolina so filled in with AP flour.  I did add 4tsp gluten as directed by the box to make up for the flours I used.  I *know* this would have better texture with the correct amounts of the correct flours but the bread I made was amazing!  dh thought it was a bit &#039;white bready&#039; because it was soft.  This is not difficult, just a bit time consuming.  I need to find a better way to prep the saffron, lol.  I ended up sloshing it all over the place!  The first shocker was that the yeast bubbled &amp; frothed.  Understand that I don&#039;t LIKE to bake.  I dislike making bread even more - there&#039;s little room for error &amp; I like to dump, stir &amp; be done.  My mom &amp; grandmother were excellent bakers &amp; think nothing of throwing together flour &amp; water, shoving it into the oven and have something marvelous come out.  I just don&#039;t GET it.  But I CAN do it when so inclined.  And I&#039;ve been looking at this recipe for a long time.  I am so happy I made it.  And amazed, lol, considering the alterations I made.  I have lots of pics to add later, Annacia!  Made for NA/ME Tag Fall &#039;13.  :)"
39835,507236,2014/5/18,5,Wonderful bread - I tagged this recipe to use up some semolina flour -- and so glad I did. This bread is wonderful and so pretty! I used the anise seed option and the bread was wonderful with chicken salad. Thanks for sharing!
126440,507236,2014/5/22,5,Wow!  Turned out great.  Love the flavor and texture.
1800083423,507609,2014/12/8,5,If you love cinnamon you&#039;ll love these bars. They are incredible.
2000912622,507609,2017/2/5,3,"Well, they've been in the oven for about 45 minutes, 15 of that on convection bake, top is getting dark brown and they are still gooey-raw looking in the center! I was supposed to have them frosted and be at a party by now..."
227978,501155,2013/6/24,0,"This was quite tasty, but I am only leaving a comment because I am not sure I made the sorbet correctly.  The recipe instructions clearly state what to do with the sugar and water, but it didn&#039;t give any further instructions regarding when to add any of the remaining ingredients. So I winged it and did what I thought seemed logical, but it didn&#039;t quite set up well enough to finish in the food processor (as specified in the last part of Step #1).  I&#039;ll be sure to try this again when I have more thorough instructions, because I know it&#039;s going to be fantastic.  Made for the Raiders of the Lost Pantry cooking contest."
58104,501155,2013/6/24,0,This is for those with a very sweet tooth! I&#039;m sorry I really wanted to enjoy this. I cheated to make this easier. I placed everything into my vita mix and blend till smooth added 6 ice cubes blended again till smooth. Placed in the freezer after 2 hour tasted (It was very very sweet) and reblended with 4 more ice cubes.  Placed in the freezer to firm up more. Removed after a couple hours tasted and we just didn&#039;t enjoy it. Sorry.
520340,500131,2013/7/11,5,Quick and easy. My family loved it. low cal as well..
994748,499476,2013/4/29,5,"This is very good and from a skeptical and picky family - that is a rave review.  I will say that I doubled the recipe and did not add the penne as my husband is avoiding pasta.  For my teenagers, I made egg noodles and topped it with the chicken and vegetables.  Thank you so much for sharing!  I will definitely be making this again!"
1803563799,523081,2016/1/16,5,"Wonderful recipe! Fresh ingredients, very easy, and delicious."
2000431901,523081,2017/11/10,5,"Good and easy. Used unsweetened coconut flakes to reduce sugar, and went with the mayo rather than ranch. Still delicious!"
20159,493561,2015/2/16,5,This is a very easy and tasty recipe!  I just started using a cast iron skillet and this was my second time using it.  Loved the corn bread!  I did have to increase the bake time by 15 mins to get the center to finish.  Was a beautiful brown on the bottom too.
2000141389,493561,2016/8/1,5,Excellent recipie with tasty results. Straightforward and easy to make. Anyone who tries to make this without greasing the pans will be sorry. I used vegtable shorting and it worked perfectly. 5 stars.
963934,493561,2017/1/19,5,"Is there anything better than finding a perfect recipe??? This is fabulous cornbread - light, sweet and the directions are spot-on. I only did one thing differently, and that was to swirl the butter in the hot cast iron skillet to coat the sides before adding the batter. My skillet is new and not seasoned for long so I expected the batter to stick. Not so. And by the by, I used butter all the way because, of course, everything IS better with butter. DH loved it and considers it cake (oh these Italians who don't get the concept of sweet/savory.) That said, I may reduce the sugar a bit next time (tonight!) just to see. A thousand thanks Doodle Pirate for working this one out. I now have a happy future without dry or gummy or gritty cornbread!"
1686076,493561,2018/12/4,4,I am not a baker so this is about as adventurous as I get in this area. The recipe was clear and straight-forward and I followed it easily. The finished bread was light and moist. I would cut back on the sugar next time as I found it a little too sweet for our taste. It also didn't hold together as well as I might have hoped and I will have to examine things to know if that was due to some error on my part or just the nature of this cornbread.
494084,518066,2015/2/7,5,"Very good.  DH and I enjoyed this healthy, easy, and quick salad.  A little sweet, a little tangy.  Kids were less thrilled but I guess thats to be expected...sigh.  Thanks for the great recipe...."
285039,495492,2013/3/2,5,I loved this combination of flavors; I also sprinkled some finely chopped prosciutto on top before baking.  I used homemade crust and sauce ... delicious!
2780567,502254,2014/1/17,5,"Thanks for the recipe!  Many moons ago, we would go to Forest View Gardens for Easter every year with my then in-laws, and got the hot slaw every time.  I recently had left over cabbage, and was looking for a hot slaw recipe and was so happy to find this!  It tasted great, but I might leave the cabbage on the counter for a while rather than putting back in the fridge so the salad would be a little warmer when mixed with the dressing.  Will definitely make again."
695933,504586,2013/11/8,5,"You certainly got my attention and interest.- To me it like or very similar to s jerk chicken. I&#039;ve used rum before, in a Caribbean dish, but never so much. So I used Myers Dark Rum, I think you may used Appleton Rum not spiced but proper Jamaican rum. Yes, excellent sauce that can be used for a number of dishes This was fantastic and So easy to do! I will definitely make this again. Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to y&#039;all!....PRMR 2013.....Grpa"
169430,505239,2014/4/30,5,"The perfect, crisp and cool, side to your steak and oven fries. Thanks for sharing your great recipes and a outstanding dinner tonight. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
632249,504071,2014/5/9,4,"A nice little smoothie and certainly easy to do.  I liked it better when I added a bit of mixed berries to it as it punched up the flavour, but that is personal taste.  I think I may even try this with a bit of peanut butter added. Thanks for the recipe! Spring PAC 2014."
461834,501114,2013/6/6,5,"These are nice and fluffly rolls!!  I made 1/4 of the recipe, which did yield 3 nice sized rolls.  To me, it seemed like a lot of extra work and pans/dishes to clean by making the Tangzhong, and I didn&#039;t notice a big difference compared to other rolls I have made at home.  But no matter how you make these, they are great rolls!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for New Kids on the Block Tag Game."
1593589,501114,2013/7/11,0,"For a rich tasting roll, use milk instead of water and butter or shortening instead of oil."
1287956,518210,2014/8/28,3,"Those are NOT fiery.  Even my tender-tongued kids didn&#039;t think this was fiery enough.  I liked the flavor of the marinade, but in order to even be considered fiery, I&#039;ll add in a couple of ghost peppers and a Trinidad Scorpion pepper, and let it marinade for a couple of hours to allow the flavors to reach a proper level."
590640,498426,2014/2/11,5,"We just recently learned my husband was diabetic and it&#039;s been interesting finding a balance between his favorite foods and what works with his blood sugar. He wanted sausage gravy and biscuits this morning and I made these biscuits. They were great! I was a little concerned about there being no egg, but they were delicious. Thanks for the recipe, it&#039;s a keeper!"
2001644177,532920,2017/7/26,5,Absolutely amazing recipe! The BOU added great flavor to the beef stir fry and vegetables. The cube wasn't too salty and was very easy to use!!!
1783373,513103,2014/3/17,5,"This corned beef dish is simply marvelous!  Made it using russet potatoes, carrots, cabbage and Korean sweet potato (my favorite).  The sour cream sauce is such a great addition too and pares perfectly.  I will be making this again, except that I need a better pressure cooker (mines from the 70&#039;s and not too safe).  Great dish KateL!  Thanks for sharing:)"
258080,513103,2014/3/22,5,This is the first time for me to cook corned beef in pressure cooker.  It came out great!! The beef was flavorful and tender and the sauce goes so well together. Best corned beef ever!!
2597942,513103,2014/4/18,5,"I actually made this on St Patty&#039;s Day, but never got around to reviewing until now. I must confess... I do not have a pressure cooker, but made the corned beef and veggies in a dutch oven on my stove top. All the ingredients on the list for the beef &amp; veg are what I use every time I make one... but the star or KateL&#039;s dish was definitely the &quot;Horseradish Sauce&quot;!!! Oh my gosh... EXCELLENT!!! Every time I make a corned beef from now on, I will be sure that this accompanies it. Truly delicious. Thanks for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
1706426,503897,2013/7/16,5,"This was good! Very refreshing, thanks for sharing! Made for zwt9"
383346,503897,2013/7/25,5,This drink was so good.  I added maybe a little bit more rum.  Thanks mersaydees :)  Made for ZWT9
135470,503897,2013/8/30,5,"Lovely! Perfect for a warm, humid summer evening. I liked the balance of the flavors, I used Jack Rudy Small Batch Grenadine which is the real stuff made with pomegranate rather than all  artificial stuff. I think this made it a little bit less sweet and gave it an earthier flavor than it might have had otherwise. Thanks for sharing mersaydees! Made for ZWT 9 by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers"
305531,536124,2018/7/9,5,"I really enjoyed this. It's close to the standard loco moco, but I love caramelized onions and they were a great addition. I cheated a little bit and used a leftover Hawaiian fried rice as the base for this. Very good. Thanks for sharing, Chef PotPie."
55906,513160,2014/2/16,2,"The photo of this recipe, on other sites, looks delightful.   Looks can be deceiving!   I read the reviews and figured the few &quot;naysayers&quot; were probably wrong.  The recipe is easy to prepare, but the end results are mediocre at best.  The dessert was rather bland tasting and the cake part was somewhat tough.  Sorry , I will not make again."
386585,508312,2014/3/19,4,"What a nice change of pace from the soups I&#039;ve been making all winter long.  It turn out a little different than I expected, and sort of reminded me or Welsh rarebit.  The flavor of the ale really carries through, which I like.  I was surprised that the cheese did not seem to make a dent in the flavor, so I added 2 more cups!  I thought that gave it the right balance.  Using the immersion blender really brought everything together nicely.  Thanks for sharing!"
2001310632,509329,2018/10/16,4,"This is a very healthy dish. Fortunately, I had an onion on hand as it is not listed in the ingredient list, but is listed in the directions. Also, 10 minutes is too long to cook small shrimp. Overall, it is a good recipe, but it could use a little more depth."
2001944535,530722,2018/1/21,0,"I just made the pancakes, I didn’t add cinnamon, flaxseed and vanilla as I didn’t have these ingredients and I forgot about salt. But they still turned out delicious!! Just eat them all, so satisfying!! Thank you!"
2617035,500022,2013/12/1,2,Made these cookies today for some Taiwanese guests coming for coffee.  Am wondering if something is missing from the recipe as the dough did not come together.  I could not roll it into balls as it just fell apart.  Added a little water to try to bind it enough to get it onto the baking sheet; it was all pretty messy.  They are now cooked and I will serve them with apologies.
226863,533151,2017/8/13,5,I halved this recipe for two servings. Turned out deliciously. I added more milk to the sauce because it was getting too thick. I also took my cauliflower out of the oven at 20 minutes. It was getting too brown. Flavors are wonderful. I enjoyed this dish with salmon. Thanks for sharing! Made for CQ 2017 for the Smok'in Chefs.
226867,533151,2017/8/22,5,"Very good cauliflower dish! I will not bother to save any leek to put on the top - it just got kind of brown and had the feel of onion skin. But it looked lovely and was delish! I used sharp, white cheddar, btw. Made for CQ4 - 2017"
157425,533151,2017/8/23,5,Delicious!
323186,533151,2018/8/29,5,"Always great comfort food, and nice with the leeks. much enjoyed, thank you, for Susies World tour"
1620171,493575,2013/3/10,5,"This was lovely. Rather easy to make too. I must admit, I'm terrible at flattening out chicken, so these probably won't be the greatest pictures for this meal, but a few skewers got that sorted out. That did mean that I was unable to follow the browning direction accurately, so I just cooked the chicken for longer. Couldn't fit the mushrooms into the rolls, so we did them in garlic and butter and served on the side, yum. Roasted the left over asparagus and served them with balsamic vinegar. Thanks for a wonderful dinner. Made for phototag winter/spring 2013"
6651,502899,2013/8/20,5,"Eggplant is my favorite &quot;new&quot; ingredient this summer. I&#039;m discovering new ways to prepare an old favorite that I used to prepare only as eggplant parmesan. This is a great recipe for a light summer dinner.  To serve, I drizzled the stacks with balsamic viniagrette.  My mozzarella slices were too thick, and next time I&#039;ll use thinner slices.  I made this recipe as a last-minute idea for dinner and only had dried herbs on hand.  Fresh herbs would make it even better."
58104,502899,2014/1/13,5,"Love this healthy and easy to make recipe. I used 1 eggplant 2 tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese adding leftover roasted Exotic Mushrooms consisting off Oyster, Maitake, and Lion&#039;s mane. After 15 minutes of roasting the eggplant I flipped then topped with very thinly sliced onion and minced garlic. I opted for a warm meal being January. So I layered all the ingredients with dried summer herbs and placed in the oven to heat n melt the cheese. Thank you."
182809,502899,2014/2/14,5,"What a hit this was at my house! I say this with true joy as all my students right now are from Asian countries and and don&#039;t go much for cheese.  After reading the reviews I did add a some grilles onions  with a little fresh garlic.I. I did cut the cheese as thin as I could. Now my big change came in how I served it. I used each stack to stuff baked portobello mushroom caps. I also drizzled just a touch of rice wine vinegar. Yes, I did make changes to your recipe but without your original one, how would I gotten to this? Thanks for a really enjoyable recipe"
37449,512716,2014/1/30,5,I used veggie bacon and loved it. I used swiss cheese with good results. Thanks!
2597942,512716,2014/3/17,5,"I made a salad for lunch today to take into my shop (I kept the dressing off until I was ready to eat it). I just finished eating it. Such a super simple and yummy salad. I&#039;m not sure if the Provolone was suppose to be shredded or cubed, but when I asked hubby to pick up 8 ounces for me the other day, he came home with deli sliced Provolone. I cut the slices into thin strips and used it that way. Thanks for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
2198343,512415,2014/5/4,5,My kids absolutely loved this ice cream sandwich cake.  It was gone in no time!  I loved that it was so easy to make.
47892,498137,2013/4/27,5,"yum! Dreamer, we made veggie bowls with this recipe. Lined the bowls with baby spinach then added a spoonful of basmati rice, the vegetable mixture/beans, fresh mint and fresh cilantro, lime slices. Perfect! Bought organic cauliflower from the farmer&#039;s market just for this occasion, too! Don&#039;t skip the mint! Made for Veg Tag/April. Thank you!"
2399085,499343,2013/9/19,5,"This was great. I let it marinate overnight and made for lunch today. We loved it! If this is how the food tastes in New Orleans, I will be visiting in the near future!!!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks"
486725,499343,2015/3/23,5,"I&#039;ve never had a po&#039; boy quite like this, but it was an excellent sandwich. We subbed pepperoni for the ham (personal preference), but I do suppose any &quot;salumi&quot; or cheese you like would work with this combo. We used only a fourth of the oil and did not hollow out the bread, but both worked out just fine. The olive tapenade is really to die for - I could see many other uses for it as well."
226867,537319,2018/11/6,3,"I'm so sorry, Bonnie - but I followed the directions exactly and I burnt the heck out of it. I checked half way through and there was no color change, then when the time was up, it was very dark and the pecans were black. I can't believe I didn't smell it burning. I will try this again and check the time more frequently! I think the squirrels will think they're having a feast tomorrow!"
2423055,497442,2013/3/13,5,"What a beautiful and delicious sounding appetizer. Perfect for a dinner party, luncheon or tea. Or would be elegant served at a wedding reception. Truly impressive. nj"

39835,503643,2013/7/18,3,this was okay but I prefer jambalaya with tomatoes and/or other vegetables and more liquid. Thanks for sharing!
226863,503643,2013/7/23,5,"I made this as posted, except I couldn&#039;t bring myself to use kielbasa in cajun jambalaya.  So I used the spicier andouille sausage and used a bit more than called for.  Loved the heat that the andouille gave this dish.  I subbed red bell peppers instead of green, because that was what i had on hand.  I&#039;m not sure what this would taste like with kielbasa, but with the andouille sausage its a 5.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Market tag game."
1226388,504835,2013/8/4,5,This was so delicious!  I love smoked salmon with eggs!  I reduced the recipe to two servings and I had this for a yummy lunch along with recipe#504846.  I used cocktail sized pumperickel breads and some of my brother&#039;s delicious home smoked sockeye salmon.  Heaven!  Made for ZWT9
296809,504835,2013/9/6,5,"Made for a fellow Goddess of ZWT-9 &amp; for Family Picks, this recipe is an easy-fix &amp; classic for the genre. It is beautiful &amp; delicious, but I doubt it would make great party food. For those who follow me, take care when you spread the bread w/butter. A very thin swipe of butter lightly applied w/a pastry brush is best. Otherwise when the hot eggs hit the buttered bread, you will have a melted mess that will not work as finger food. ~ I used Radskonubraud (a very dense &amp; heavily-seeded dark bread), cut rounds w/my 1.5-in &amp; 3-in cookie cutters &amp; served them w/fruit as you see in the pics. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. We loved it &amp; it was a great breakfast (eaten at the table w/a knife &amp; fork). :-)"
2216338,497382,2013/3/13,5,Great recipe.  I love the flvor combination.  sw%u263A
945395,500911,2013/8/7,5,"Kate, this is awesome, I love it! Perfect blend of flavors, great texture (this is somebody who grew up on peanut butter/banana sandwiches!). The sour cream balances everything beautifully. I used all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour. Thanks for your recipe. I will be making it often!"
2002046678,500911,2018/3/20,5,Great recipe. I was skeptical of only 1\4 cup brown sugar but it's sweet enough. I tend to weigh bananas because they vary so much in size so 1 and 1\2cups is between 10&amp;11 ounces peeled bananas. I was short bananas so I made up the difference in volume with some vanilla instant pudding made with water that I waited to set and just added enough to make the correct volume of bananas called for. Personally I am going to toast and spread some Hershey's chocolate spread on it.
318262,517857,2014/8/28,5,This was absolutely delicious and addictive! Such a complex taste with so few sauce ingredients. The potatoes especially soaked up the flavors in a great way. Will make this again and again.
1802636312,515015,2014/4/1,5,Great pizza! Easy instructions and tastes great!
1802643345,515015,2014/4/5,5,Epic!!!
1802643397,515015,2014/4/5,5,Loved the bacon jam! Great change to pizza!
11341007,515015,2014/4/6,4,Different for sure. Recipe easy to follow.
1802644423,515015,2014/4/7,5,"My favorite things finally together! I&#039;ve always enjoyed leftover pizza for breakfast, but a breakfast pizza? I was reluctant at first, but I&#039;m so glad I tried this. It is ridiculously good! Easy to make. Great instructions. Well done!"
865936,501399,2013/8/24,4,This is red because of the tomato sauce.  Love the flavor.
906665,510939,2013/12/30,4,"I really liked making this in the crockpot. So much easier than the oven! The only issue I had was that many of the shreddies burned. More frequent stirring should help that, as the Cheerios and pretzels were just fine. Thanks for the recipe!"
2430064,497382,2013/3/13,0,Glad the phot is up because this is pretty and sounds delicious too!
204024,495101,2013/4/5,5,"Easy, quick and delicious.   Just the right amount of topping and great with ice cream on top.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2013."
131126,495101,2013/9/22,4,"While this tasted good, my diners thought it would have benefited from a juicier filling. The topping was great, but the lack of moisture in the apples rendered the overall flavor dry. Pairing it with ice cream helped. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
1800195590,508215,2013/11/5,5,"These were excellent.  Very yummy, not too sweet.  I did a half batch and the recipe halved nicely.  I also didn&#039;t let mine sit anywhere near 30 minutes - more like 15 - and the cookies were perfect coming out of the oven at 30 minute cook time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thanks!"
1802593349,508215,2014/3/17,1,"This was probably the worst tasting recipe I have ever baked. I followed the recipe very carefully. When I tasted them, I thought I must have missed some crucial ingredients, but after rechecking the ingredients, measurements and instructions, I hadn&#039;t. They are very, very bland, unless you happen to get a chocolate chip in every bite. My family wouldn&#039;t touch them with a 10 foot pole. I had to throw them out, which is something I&#039;ve never had to do with any of my baked goods. Healthy does not have to be tasteless."
486725,514338,2015/6/23,4,"We love green enchilada sauce, so were excited to try this as a new way to have our veggie burgers. It was good (if a bit messy!)."
107135,514338,2015/8/31,5,loved these very messy but amazing  cherry bombers
128473,527645,2016/8/3,5,I really enjoy fried plantain chips and this lovely recipe does not disappoint. All the fried chips need is a little sea salt. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Made for CQ3 - Bahamas
143318,504154,2013/7/30,5,"This really does taste like a Greek salad with the olives, feta and lemon. This was my first time removing the skin from chickpeas and it makes them a nice consistency; I will start doing that when I make hummus too! Great recipe!"
486725,504154,2013/8/17,5,Really good! Definitely reminded us of hummus. Used lots more cucumbers and I bet using thick slices as a topping instead would give it a great crunch. Flavors all work wonderfully in this.
452355,504154,2013/9/27,4,"I enjoyed this salad stuffed inside of a pita pocket.  I used mayo because that is what I had on hand, but I think I would have enjoyed it better with the Greek yogurt option.  I appreciated that this made for a quick and easy meal with ingredients I typically have.  Thanks for posting."
2000849677,500803,2016/2/1,2,"Too wet, flat and eggy. Next time I would add some kind of raising agent - salt or something. I whipped the egg whites and folded them in for some measure of body. Good thing I did because otherwise, it would have been a total disaster."

305531,494308,2016/11/16,5,I really enjoyed this simple dinner. Only change I made was to add onion. Thanks for sharing.
865936,503850,2013/7/24,5,"Very lovely potato salad.  It had cooled by the time I was serving,  so I popped it into the microwave for one minute."
582561,503850,2013/10/18,4,"I used small white skinned potatoes as I couldn&#039;t find small red skinned variety.  Used slightly less oil as suggested by Tisme, otherwise made as per recipe.  Very nice and went well with the sirloin steak I cooked.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap October 2013."
1802694579,515553,2014/4/24,5,Great recipe!
169430,515553,2014/5/4,5,"Had to use white wine vinegar and Splenda and got a very enjoyable salad. I love that this delivers a lot of flavor while remaining low in fat. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
314579,517872,2014/8/20,4,"Really great.  I decided to skewer the pineapple.  The only downside is that I think shaking the pineapple in the baggie with the sugar, put too much sugar coating on the pineapple.  I don&#039;t think this would be a problem if you did it slices per the recipe.  Thanks Lynn!"
305531,517872,2014/8/24,5,Tasty! I cut my pineapple in thick wedges. My coals were a little too low (after grilling the meat) so they didn&#039;t cook very well. My fault. I finished them up on a stove top grill. We really enjoyed these but I found it impossible to stage them for a photo. lol. Thanks Lynn for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
542159,518104,2014/8/30,4,This had a nice light fluffy filling that had a wonderful Italian flavor. I cut this down to serve one so just kind of eyeballed the herbs and used 1/4 lb. of ground meat. The pepper was cooked perfectly and by letting it rest 10 minutes I enjoyed a nice hot pepper without burning my mouth. The only change I might make in the future is to add some kind of binder such as an egg or some cheese. But as written is nice and healthy and very tasty. Thanks for the post.
1052873,536119,2018/7/4,5,This was easy and tasty. The toasted macadamia nuts really made it. Next time I would use less dressing.
10404,536119,2018/7/6,5,Wow I enjoyed this. As another reviewer said it makes a lot of dressing so next time I will use half for basting chicken or pork to go with this wonderful slaw! Loved the nut addition! Made for Susie's World Tour 2018.
227978,536119,2018/7/7,5,"This was really good, and it's so easy to make, too. The addition of the pineapple gave it a nice hint of sweetness, and the sesame/soy dressing was super good. We all loved it, and that doesn't happen all that often in my home. Thanks, Chef PotPie. Made for SWT 2018 (Hawaii)."
246482,536119,2018/7/7,5,Excellent it was light enough to enjoy with a big meal. Made for Susies WORLD TOUR 2018 FOR HAWAII I am with the pantry Pirates

690623,536119,2018/7/12,5,We just loved this slaw. So bright and fresh! I'll be making this one for years to come. Thank you for posting! Made for Susie's World Tour 2018
226867,536119,2018/7/14,5,What a lovely version of coleslaw! We liked this a lot plus it was pretty! I didn't roast the the nuts in the oil b/c I forgot to! Made for SWT2018
305531,536119,2018/7/22,5,Nice coleslaw. I especially enjoyed the addition of the mac nuts and pineapple. Thanks for sharing.
128473,515664,2014/5/9,4,"These were lovely scrambled eggs.  I never made eggs with baking powder added to them before.  It worked really well in this dish.  The eggs were light, tender, fluffy and fragile.  I enjoyed them prepared this way.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
280271,510904,2013/12/19,5,What a pleasant surprise...the chicken was crispy on the outside...yet the inside was moist and tender...I put all the flour ingredients in a zip lock bag...tossed and turned it all with the chicken pieces inside...they got a nice coating of the flour mixture...when all was done I just tossed the bag in the trash...easy peasy...and delicious...=)
305531,510904,2014/1/16,5,Great chicken! I used thighs and drumsticks and did as Teresa did - coated them in the flour mixture in a zip lock bag. It was just the way we like chicken - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Thanks Rosie for sharing. Congrats again on your football win!
226863,510904,2014/1/17,5,"I coated my chicken by tossing in a ziplock bag, and this worked perfectly.  The chicken was very moist and tender, while the crust was nice and crisp.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for your win in Football Tag!"
870705,510904,2014/2/25,5,This great recipe is similar to one I already use except this one uses less butter.  A great addition to my chicken recipe rotation!  Made for Football Pool 2013.
724631,510904,2014/2/26,5,"Simplicity triumphs!  No fancy herb mixture, no thick crumb crust, just well-cooked chicken with a thin crisp skin and a fantastic red-brown glow.  It just tastes great!  I almost felt guilty for not working more for dinner, but the guilt disappeared when we ate this succulent chicken.  For the record, I ate every bit of the skin, wouldn&#039;t miss it for the world!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
183964,510904,2017/1/25,5,"I loved it! This is the best way to get fried chicken without making a huge mess and using a quart of oil. All of my other oven fried chicken recipes need bread or panko crumbs blah blah blah and are dry-baked. This is sooo much better and only uses seasoned flour that you can adjust to your family's tastes. This is the ONLY way I will make EVER make oven fried chicken in the future. Good job, Rosie!"

2859859,501428,2013/6/11,5,This was excellent!  I did my normal adding Pico to it.
1803051449,501428,2014/8/19,0,seems lame.  where is the grill ?  why marinate scallops at all&lt;br/&gt;when they are delicious on their own with maybe a quick dressing while they are cooking.
169430,500553,2014/6/1,5,"I cut this back to 2 servings and made as directed minus the cucumber which I can&#039;t say that I love. Oh Yeah, and I had to use dried mint as I haven&#039;t seen any fresh yet this year (1.5 tsp&#039;s there of). I know that the fresh mint would have been nicer but when it comes down to it, you have to work with what you have. I still loved it a lot and the pistachio/apricot combo is stellar. So glad I found this for the NA/ME Couscous and Rice tag (Spring 2014)."
2001634004,507365,2017/7/19,0,"I have made this wonderful cake many times and it's always a big hit. However, when I remove it from the oven, the lovely top has formed a crust that collapses onto the cake. I use a hand mixer and only beat the butter and sugar on medium and as I add the eggs I turn the mixer to low. By hand, I incorporate the cake flour because I thought I was over beating. Do you have any idea what is causing this? The frosting masks the problem but I'd like to get it done right!! Thanks."
2001628781,514337,2017/7/16,0,It worked perfectly. I don't own a microwave so I heated it on the stove whisking for the two minutes. I used olive oil instead of canola and added a bit more as I found the texture was too dense. I used it as the two egg yolks in a traditional mayonnaise recipe and it tasted just like regular homemade mayo.
357071,492767,2013/1/9,5,this was excellent.  I did add a small onion and I served it cold. thanks for a great recipe.
1745502,505724,2013/8/19,4,"This was a nice recipe, but a bit bland for me. I chopped the veggies into bite-sized peices and grilled them in a grilling basket. That made the prep time shorter. I liked the lemony flavour, but I would have increased the amount of spices."
1591701,517715,2014/8/17,5,This was a great recipe. Only thing we added was a clove of garlic. Very tasty! Thanks for sharing!
780172,503601,2013/9/11,4,"This was a nice change of pace from the usual green beans I make. I love tomatoes, so it was nice to have them along with the green beans. Only thing is there was too much liquid, not sure if I was suppose to drain the beans at the end, but then I felt you wouldn&#039;t get the tomato flavor enough. I used fresh green beans and fresh herbs from my garden. Next time I will use a little more herbs, felt it could have been a little more flavorful or maybe use the flavored diced tomatoes."
461834,536384,2018/7/26,5,"Wonderful, tasty, buttery biscuits!! I cut the recipe in half, and made as written except for adding some chopped chives!! So good. I used my ice cream scoop for making the drop biscuits, but they were on the small side, so next time I will just hand form them to the size I want, lol!! Thanks for sharing this yummy biscuit recipe."
542159,536384,2018/7/28,5,"These were sooo buttery good!! I made using an enamel coated cast iron pan which gave a nice crispy bottom to the biscuits. I did not have an ice cream scoop so used a large spoon to kind of drop them into the pan which made them kind of too big, next time will use a smaller spoon. And yes there will be a next time because these were amazing."
128473,536384,2018/8/6,5,"These biscuits were perfect. I wish i could give you 10 stars... so good, just the way I like them, crisp and crunchy on the outside with a beautiful butter flavor and soft and tender inside.

2549237,502878,2013/7/16,4,"This marinade was super easy to make.  You couldn&#039;t really taste the orange, but I think that my oranges were old.  It reminded me of a butter garlic wing sauce.  I made along with your recipe for Mojo Chicken Wings.  Thanks Lavender Lynn.  Made for New Kids On The Block tag game."
2597942,495524,2013/4/7,5,"I am soooo happy that I ran across this recipe this morning. I made this for hubby and I, for a late lunch today. The only way I can describe this recipe is &quot;Tator Tot &amp; Chicken Nugget&quot; got married in a bucket of hot sauce!!! I used the ingredients listed (except the blue cheese), but found it necessary to switch it up a bit. I only had two boneless, skinless chicken breasts thawed (which was plenty for us). I started marinating the chicken in homemade hot sauce as soon as I found this recipe, and thawed the hash-browns (I used approx 2 cups). I tried to dredge one strip in the potatoes, but they didn&#039;t seem to stick well. So the chicken went back into the marinade, potatoes went into the food processor for two or three pulses, then I wrung them out in a cotton dish towel. I spread the potatoes back into the casserole dish and let sit a bit. I tried dredging again, and the chicken was coated perfectly! I placed them on a parchment paper lined sheet pan, and cooked as directed. (I forgot to mention... I only sliced one breast into strips, the other I made into chicken nuggets). When they were almost cooked thru (about 20 minutes), I dipped them again into the hot sauce, returned them to the oven and cooked a few more minutes (I didn&#039;t want hubby to be dipping/dripping hot sauce over our beige carpeting). We do not like blue cheese, so I skipped that portion of this recipe. I served the chicken strips and nuggets with baby carrot sticks and some pre-packaged Ranch dressing cups (those little things are great to pack in a &quot;to-go&quot; lunch). Thank you for posting such a clever recipe. I will make this again. (Made for &quot;Zarr Chef Alphabet Soup&quot; tag game)."

Had minced garlic in the fridge so that is what I used and parsley instead of cilantro. The orange juice wasnt very sour so I added some pineapple juice for tartness. We will make this marinade for the chicken wings again soon!"
2001690935,502297,2017/8/28,5,"Wonderful. Left out the Capers, while they were listed in the ingredients list they were not in the directions. Also was short on time and baked this at 400 for 3 1/2 hours and got the same outcome. Made this thinking it was the Couscous version, guess I should have finished reading the last sentence of the directions. Now I just have to figure out where we can find that Amazir Wine they serve at Restaurant Marrakesh."
2765447,497396,2013/4/1,5,What a treat!  My favorite mushrooms with just the right amount of potatoes and cheese...the only part I didn&#039;t like was having to wait for 30 minutes before digging in :-)
2000541579,511679,2015/10/9,1,Stuck to the parchment paper grr if you didn&#039;t get them off right away so mad grr
384210,519510,2017/3/19,5,"Super yummy, and easy. The brown sugar seems to burn more easily than white sugar so make sure you don't make your layer too thick!"
2324285,501326,2013/6/10,5,"I loved this stew!   The coconut milk makes it taste like a Thai curry, but the Brazilian flavors are there as well.  Very nice-looking, and easy to make.  I chopped up 3 tomatoes instead of using canned tomatoes- I&#039;m sure it really made a difference and was worth the small amount of extra effort."
1800169667,501326,2013/10/30,1,Only one ingredient missing - but a VERY important one: &quot;Dend&ecirc;&quot; Oil - also called Palm Oil.
1802707332,501326,2014/4/30,5,Absolutely delicious!! I used heavy cream and half the amount of sriracha sauce and it was perfect to me (I love spicy food). I will make it again and again.
2001573748,501326,2017/6/7,5,"Made the recipe a day before I was going to eat the stew and let it cool down with the shrimp. When I ate the shrimp stew the next day what a treat. There are a few things I might change next time-I would add the shrimp after I had turned off the heat and let them cook more slowly so they didn't get so tough, and add the cilantro just before serving, as it got lost in the stew. I did need to add about 1 tablespoon of sugar to tone down the lime juice but that was a personal preference. So easy to make and went great as a summer soup with grilled steak. Looking forward to making it again-note that I used unsweetened coconut milk when i made the recipe."
2001853370,501326,2017/12/12,5,"After seeing the dish on a Food Network show (at a restaurant far, far away), I went hunting for a recipe like this. Perfect, easy, fun to make! Except peeling the shrimp, but hey"
305531,504079,2013/8/19,5,Loved this! I couldn&#039;t believe how much flavor this added to the corn. This is going straight into my Best of 2013 cookbook. Thanks Sharon for this great keeper. Made for ZWT9.
539686,504079,2013/8/22,5,"I agree with lazyme...it was amazing! I meant to take a photo but before I could, they disappeared. The taste is fantastic and they are very easy to do. I cooked them a bit differently than called for since I don&#039;t enjoy having the husks left on. I husked my corn and steamed them for about 8 minutes. Then I grilled them on my cast iron griddle and applied the coconut milk baste at that time. The grill marks look pretty and it is a keeper for sure!!! Made for ZWT 9."
383346,504079,2013/8/22,5,"When I saw this recipe, I was curious of the taste of coconut with corn.  I was not too sure about it.  But finally it&#039;s so good.  I liked it a lot.  THanks Sharon :)  Made for ZWT9"
383346,499661,2013/6/3,5,The marinade gave a really good taste to the beef.  The fajitas were yummy with the veggies.  We added shredded cheddar cheese.  Thanks Lynn :)  Made for PRMR tag game
2597942,499661,2013/6/8,5,"Absolutely 5 *****  This meal was delightful! I had a very small lime, so I don&#039;t think that I got quite a 1/4 c of juice out of it... and I did use the rest to make my Recipe #495237 , to serve with it (the traditional version). Didn&#039;t matter either way... dinner was wonderful! I think my flour tortillas were only bout 6&quot;, but I didn&#039;t measure. I nuked them about 15 seconds wrapped in a damp paper towel in the microwave. Hubby over cooked the steak a tad bit on the grill, but that&#039;s why the marinade is so helpful... it wasn&#039;t dry! (I did mine about 6 hours).  I also served this with cheese and sour cream on the side. Thank you for posting this lovely recipe. (Made for &quot;Name That Ingredient&quot; tag). P.S. I forgot to mention... I skipped the oregano and I used a green bell pepper."
266635,499661,2014/5/22,5,"Great fajitas!  Marinated the meat overnight and it was really flavorful and tender.  The only change I made was to use a large piece of sirloin steak as flank steak is not readily available (not sure why) and I didn&#039;t want to use skirt steak.  Served with grilled onions/peppers, avocado, lime crema and cheese.  Served alongside Mexican rice and corn on the cob.  Great dinner.  Made for PRMR, May, 2014."
2000467054,523541,2015/9/11,5,"This was the bomb! I ain&#039;t even having a sleeve, just wanted a good soup with lots of protein. I ended up adding another container of broth and some chick peas."
45083701,499178,2014/11/16,5,"I have made this in the past, and yes, it is a lot of work, but the taste is phenomenal. I will add that if you are working on an electric or convection type stove top, this recipe is more challenging because of the different temperatures needed throughout the recipe. The custard needs to be monitored carefully. If I had a gas range top, this recipe would be easier. &lt;br/&gt;Don&#039;t let that discourage you! I will be making this recipe again next week for my husbands birthday, so I will try to most some images if possible."
1803504070,499178,2014/12/18,5,Excellent recipe.. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUT the &quot;author&quot; left out 1-1/2 tsp vanilla extract in the pastry cream recipe ingredients. The instructions say &quot;add vanilla&quot; but she didnt&#039; put the quantity in the ingredients list.
1663041,499178,2017/1/5,5,"I have used cake mix in the past for my boston cream pie, but I decided to try a scratch cake recipe and this did not disappoint. The cake was moist and sweet, and so much tastier than a boxed cake. I made my favorite pastry cream from another site, but I did use the recipe for this ganache (semisweet chips instead of the bittersweet chocolate), which was easy and delicious. I would advise first-time bakers to read the recipe through carefully, as it is a little unusual. The end result is well worth the effort."
2000947534,499178,2018/2/17,5,"I thought this was excellent, I just arranged mine a little different, I put the cakes in the freezer to really chill them and semi frozen, then i cut each in half, spread custard on all the layers, then drizzled the chocolate glaze on top, next time I will make a bit more custard and lean to a chocolate gnash for the glaze.- always cut with a knife that is run in hot water between slices or dipped in a pan of hot water to get that clean slice."
2002054878,499178,2018/3/16,5,"Followed this recipe exactly for my husbands birthday... we loved it! Something you should know before starting, it requires parchment paper and lots of time to chill in between and after steps, but it is worth it and delicious!"
2002182274,499178,2018/6/11,5,"Time consuming? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely!! My 6 year old son wanted Boston Cream Pie after watching Great American Baker. He helped every step of the way and it turned out perfectly. Try it, you will LOVE it!"
2001241356,499178,2018/7/12,5,"I don't remember that last I spend this much in the kitchen for just 1 dessert, but well worth my time. I did however make substitions for all the sugars and instead used Great Value No Calorie Sweetener, you use it like sugar cup for cup. I have diabetics in my home and their Doc's tend a little snippy when blood sugar levels go up and up, lol. Anyway I did have a problem with the topping, it was fairly runny, I am wondering if anyone else has had this problem and to rectify this runny situation."
2002279303,499178,2018/9/19,5,Followed the recipe exactly as written. Was amazed at how perfectly it turned out - the recipe is written so well. I do agree with another commenter that said this would be difficult if using an electric cooktop -- the quick temperature adjustments when making the pastry cream would be a challenge.
2002131611,499178,2018/10/4,5,Fantastic recipe! I love to bake and wouldn’t call myself a novice but I was a little intimidated because I had never even tasted a Boston cream pie. But it turned out flawlessly and even my Boston cream connoisseur parents in law loved it!
136997,496350,2014/2/22,4,"Going on what the recipe poster mentioned in their intro, I did some adjustments to this recipe. I chose to use 1 cup fresh breadcrumbs, adding 1/4 cup of stock to moisten, because I felt the dry crumbs would make the stuffing too dry. It also might benefit from a bit more oregano. I sauteed a clove of garlic in the drippings before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients. I agree with the poster, there&#039;s something missing, but overall we enjoyed it. Made for Everyday Holiday Tag game. :)"
1287956,517108,2014/7/14,5,"I&#039;m not a huge fan of curry, but when it was combined with the cilantro in the rice, the sweetness from the brown sugar, and the heat from the chilies, it was outstanding.  Instead of jalepenos, I used a few pequins because under the heat, those have a bit of citrus flavor, which melded better with the shrimp."
865936,503439,2013/9/6,4,This was very good and different from anything I&#039;ve had before.  It also was great to pack for taking to work.
143318,514181,2014/3/24,5,"Outstanding in every way! Vibrant colors and flavors (don&#039;t leave out the jalapeno), and a filling healthy meal. I made in advance and refrigerated, adding the chilled dressing and sliced mango and avocado before serving. The lime cilantro dressing is an amazing recipe on its own!"
128473,493197,2013/12/11,5,"Made exactly as written but I did marinate the pork for 8 hours, wow, was it ever flavorful.  It was perfection, tender and oh so flavorful.  This quick and easy to make dish was splendid served with Jamaican rice and peas and butter roasted carrots.  What a great meal we had. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  My dh enjoyed it so much that he has already asked me to make it again."
857489,493197,2014/1/24,5,"This is our favorite for pork tenderloin! Made it just as directed, except I use 2 lbs tenderloin  ( 2  1 pound pieces) . I serve it with mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Highly recommended !"
539686,497096,2013/4/4,5,These are just what I was looking for! So tasty and easy to make. I served them with a white sauce and veggies and it was a tasty and easy on the calorie dinner. Thanks for posting.
2824276,497096,2013/7/7,4,"4.5 stars! Made this today and we loved them! I wanted meatballs I could bake and we are also trying to be healthier (although I did use some for Swedish meatballs tonight, which is not so healthy but yummy!). I used a 3# package of 85% lean turkey and 2-9 oz. packages of frozen spinach. I got LOTS of meatballs, about 70+ so mine are smaller than the poster&#039;s were. It was a lot of spinach, kinda too much, but the overall flavor was so good and most importantly, my little one ate them and said &#039;more, please&#039;. I also used whole wheat Italian seasoned breadcrumbs; I mixed the Worchester sauce in with the turkey/egg/breadcrumbs simply because I&#039;ve always done it that way. Next time I may try less spinach and either brown rice or quinoa instead of bread crumbs (trying to eat less processed stuff) but most definitely will make this again, and I have a ton in the freezer which is wonderful for quick future meals."
1802975920,497096,2014/7/29,5,"This is the second time I have made these meatballs.  The first time, I made them almost exactly as written, although I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  They were terrific.  Tonight I had very little spinach, so I substituted fresh arugula and fresh romaine plus a little bit of fresh basil to round out the greens.  As suggested by another reviewer,  I also used whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs, added a little fresh jalapeno to the saut&eacute;ed garlic and onion, and a handful of parmesan cheese to the whole mixture before baking.  They were absolutely delicious this time, too!  I served it with whole wheat pasta and pre-made marinara from Costco.  This is my new go-to baked meatball recipe.  Thanks, emcglone."
2001134508,497096,2016/8/19,5,"This has become a family favorite. We have been making it for at least 2 years now. My son is allergic to eggs, so we substitute ground flax seeds and usually use fresh spinach instead of frozen. Great flavor combination! Easy and quick. We serve with a red sauce!"
280271,507114,2013/9/29,4,This was really good...although both hubby and I didn&#039;t care for the salmon on the salad...it just didn&#039;t seem to fit in with the dish...it was too dominant ...we loved the dressing with the asparagus and salad...I will make this again but leave off the salmon...btw...I used Alaskan wild salmon...=)
174096,502823,2013/8/21,5,"Great blend of flavors - this has everything - spicy, sweet, tangy, salty!  Very flavorful and packs a punch.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
222478,502823,2014/3/2,5,This had a beautiful balance of flavor and was a great dipping sauce for some mini spring rolls. Only change I made was to use fresh chilies rather than dried.
724631,511698,2014/1/25,5,"A Walk on the Wild Side for me, but I loved these!  Step 1: the chicken came out moist and delicious. but my favorite way to cook chicken and get some chicken broth is Recipe #369106.   Step 2: the most daring part for me: I had 2 jalapeno peppers (couldn&#039;t get serrano peppers) and that took the sauce to &quot;2-Alarms&quot;, the maximum amount of heat DH and I can tolerate.  For the tomatoes, I used the whole tomatoes from 2 28-oz. cans of whole San Marzano tomatoes, reserving the tomato juice for some miscellaneous liquid requirement.  The sauce tasted &quot;finished&quot;, not canned, yippee!  Step 3: here is where I wish I had 3 cups chicken broth from Recipe#369106 for fuller flavor (although there is so much flavor in the sauce as written).  I found that 1 hr. 30 minutes of simmering was needed to develop a thick sauce, and I would do the same next time.  Step 4: Couldn&#039;t find Mexican crema, but Chowhound folks insist that cr&egrave;me fraiche is very similar; I was very happy that I used cr&egrave;me fraiche instead of ubiquitous grocery store sour cream.  Step5: made me tremble and procrastinate, but once I used my small saut&eacute; pan and made sure that the vegetable oil had reached a very high temperature, this step was a piece of cake. Step 6: well, I forgot to add the sliced onions that had been chilling in the refrigerator, but I was thrilled with my enchilada!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2702088,495259,2013/2/24,5,"Love this ""version"" of Mexican cornbread."
2836883,497509,2013/5/23,0,"I really want to try this recipe from scratch one day.  My grandmother, born in Louisiana of Sicilian parents,  would celebrate St. Joseph&#039;s Day by cooking this dish. She never wrote down any recipies, so I don&#039;t have it, but am happy to find it here!  I have used the canned Con Sarde and added tomato paste and water to it and then served it over spaghetti. I learned of the canned product and was so happy to, after many years, experience the taste of this wonderful dish!"
2198343,507271,2014/2/18,5,"This is a great crepe recipe, the crepes are really soft and with a nice creamy taste.  They are perfect to eat with a sweet or savory filling.  I have always used the same recipe, but now I am switching to this one."
43588527,533917,2017/11/14,0,"Rather than make a pie crust or bake it like a pie, do you think I could triple the ingredients and bake it in a 9&quot; x 14&quot; glass baking dish?"

My NA*ME neighbor said that Recipe #492975 would be more typically Omani, but she took home a large container of rice and chicken for her dinner tomorrow night.  I bought the smallest chicken I could find, but the roaster took 1 1/2 hours; I think it would have been tastier had I used my Showtime rotisserie to baste the chicken as it cooked.

1802722039,515833,2014/5/6,5,"Hands down, one of the best tacos I&#039;ve ever had. Delicious!  These need to be readily available for those folks that don&#039;t cook, i.e. food truck or restaurant. I will attempt to make them myself:) Thanks for sharing!"

126440,515833,2014/6/22,4,Very good use for the leftover pulled pork I had.  Made the sauce and the tacos.  Served with a salad.
690623,496507,2013/3/11,5,A really lovely dressing that does not overpower the salad ingredients.  It's a keeper!  I can see using this on any sort of greens with almost any add ins.  A winner in this house!
453440,520092,2015/10/23,5,"Awesome bread for taste, texture!  Oh and the whole house smells so good when I make it.  It deserves many more stars than five.  Thank you for putting an old recipe in a safe place.  I have been making this recipe for many years.  It&#039;s a fun recipe to make.  If you love making bread, you need to try this one.  Putting the dough together and rolling it out isn&#039;t difficult. (I do knead it a bit to ready it for rolling out.)  After rolling out the dough I cut  it out in strips rather than filling the rolled out dough.  It may take more time to fill each strip, but, it&#039;s easier to pinch each strip for braiding, for me.  I usually make one bread.  Move the filled strips to my baking pan and braid it there.  Let it raise and then bake.  It&#039;s worth the time.  I usually make it when I have stew, soup, or a basic meal that is ready and just needs to be warmed up for dinner.  You will have time to prepare a veggie or salad while it is rising for the oven.  If you try it I know you will love it."
2000431901,515833,2016/5/13,5,"I would give this a sixth star if I could! Really easy, so flavorful. Made wonderful tacos with a broccoli slaw, pickled radishes, and sriracha mayo. Making these for family on our beach trip next week. Oh, only change was I used a generic BBQ sauce and molasses in place of the hoisin because I was out. Added a smokey flavor that was really wonderful."
2000207906,515833,2017/7/9,5,"I didn't have rice wine so I used some chardonnay and I used the squeeze bottles of lemongrass and ginger since I didn't have fresh on hand, but otherwise I followed the recipe list exactly as written. I didn't baste my pork in the sauce during slow cooking because my pork had a nice layer of fat and I knew the sauce would get lost. However, as soon as I shredded the pork I added a generous 1/2 - 3/4 cup of sauce and kept warm while the rest of the sauce was thickening. I served the pork on grilled corn tortillas with red cabbage, savoy cabbage, sliced radishes and green onion. We drizzled siracha mayo and more sauce on top. What a fantastic recipe!!"
493093,515833,2018/6/30,0,I assume the first half cup of water goes in the crock pot ? The recipe doesn't mention it.

1800953684,530639,2018/3/19,0,"I have never liked making or eating this type of dessert.It is so Sweet and tastes like lard or a cube of Butter or Shortening. My Grandsons Love them however so I continue to make them with boys designs that they like. I had a little problem keeping them from falling off the stick so as soon as I got the cake cooled down, I mixed immediately with frosting as per recipe instructions stated then put them in the frig, oops, forgot 1 thing. I put some Melting Chocolate Wafers, Chocolate flavor for chocolate cake. I use white Chocolate in the mixture for other colors but it’s up to you on flavors and colors you want your Cake Pops to be. Then I chilled the dough for up to 30 minutes. ***After that time, remove dough from frig and using either a small Cookie Scoop or teaspoon, start making balls out of the dough trying to keep the dough the same size. If they vary in size too much, some cookies will be raw and some will be burned that is why consistency is so important. A Cookie scoop is easy for consistency, just fill with dough, pack it in good, then level it off flat. If you are using a teaspoon to scoop the dough and are not an experienced Baker, You can practice by using a good scale and trying to get the same amount of dough each time. Practice different sizes of Balls then practice rolling them in your “Clean Hands”. I hope this idea will help as far as the person not being able to keep Cake Pop on the Stick. It sounds like the dough is to wet."

2000067996,533869,2017/12/1,0,"At the top it says 2 hrs. 30 min, so I would presume since you refrigerate it for 2 hrs., it is somewhere around 30 mins."
2001729176,533869,2018/1/9,0,"This looks a sounds great, but you appear to be missing a step. How long do you bake it for? I'd love to try it this weekend, since it's so snowy and cold right now, but don't want to under- or over-cook it."
2002243778,533869,2018/8/9,0,loved it
2001202033,527037,2016/10/10,5,IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! Not overly sweet like other recipes I've tried
2156634,527037,2016/10/30,5,This was the perfect eggless cookie dough recipe. Flavour was what I was looking for and met my pregnancy cookie dough cravings without worrying about the eggs. Thanks for the recipe.
2002176137,527037,2018/10/4,0,Am I missing how hot the oven should be and how long they should cook??
2002242483,536688,2018/8/8,5,Good for kids...birthday parties!!!
2002261089,536688,2018/8/29,1,it does not work extremely dry add more liquid try topping with peanut butter or topping of your prefferences

1802981931,517709,2014/8/7,5,I made these tonight and they were a hit big thumbs up. Thank you for sharing. I love Swedish meatballs and they were next to best
2067245,517709,2014/8/7,5,"These were better than IKEA&#039;s Swedish meatballs, so that is saying a lot. Thanks for sharing and good luck."
1802623856,514975,2014/4/6,5,Wow....I saw quesadilla with sweet potatoes and brie and as a cook I had to try it. It was amazing!  Potatoes are not usually part of my diet but using sweet potatoes made me really want to try it because they are pretty good for you.  It was gourmet and a nice change to the other recipes using potatoes...hats off to this chef.  I have to admit that I was impressed and a little surprised others haven&#039;t tried this. Maybe everyone is used to meat and potatoes...but if you are up for a nice change give this recipe a shot!!
1802646184,514975,2014/4/6,0,"A sweet potato quesadilla...really???  How have I not done this before.  It is healthy, rich, and flavorful.  I can see it made with a bunch of cheeses but brie made it very tempting. I&#039;ve been looking at a lot of the recipes on this 5 ingredient fix link but this one actually used great ingredients instead of meat, canned food, and bland ingredients.  I might actually attempt this recipe for my daughter.  They might not even know it&#039;s relatively healthy for her!!!"
632249,504052,2014/5/4,5,"This is how we do it too.  We prefer the taste of the flavour packet when it isn&#039;t diluted in the broth as indicated on the packet.  Made for Spring PAC 2014, thanks for posting!"
2493184,512302,2014/5/23,5,My husband and I loved this recipe. This is not s dish for people that do not care for spicy food. The prep work will take some time but well worth it.
2001066024,512302,2016/6/27,5,"WOW!! This recipe, IMHO, is even better than PF Changs. I will def bemaking this again, forever. This is going in my all time favorites box. Thank you for this recipe. Again, WOW!!!!"
2002241833,512302,2018/8/7,0,Delicious but needed more oil and a tad dry. It’s good though.
37449,504639,2013/8/6,5,"So easy and so good. My plantain turned black, which produced a very sweet taste. Love plantain like this with rice and beans. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 by team Hot Stuff."

852554,504639,2013/8/10,5,"These were very good for my first time making plantains!  I double fried them and sprinkled with salt as soon as they came out the second time, then with the chives.  Made for ZWT 9"
865936,504639,2013/8/11,5,"This is how I find restaurants serve sweet plantain.  I was afraid they would not cook through, but they did - no problem!"
39835,510489,2013/12/20,5,"We made this recipe with modifications -- but it was still  a winner. As I did not have any ravioli I used a package of macaroni, cooked and instead of the mozzarella I used 8 ounces or so of shredded cheese (Mexican - mixed types of cheese), but otherwise followed the directions a written. This dish was very good -- my family cleaned the casserole -- and I think using the ravioli would have made it that much better. Thanks for sharing!"
2000213777,510489,2015/5/20,5,My non-vegetable eating husband LOVED this!! It&#039;s simple. It&#039;s delicious! It&#039;s a great meal to freeze for later!
169430,512456,2014/2/1,5,Aside from omitting the molasses and using less hot peppers for DH&#039;s sake this was made by the recipe and very much enjoyed. We&#039;re doing home reno and it was great to have this on the stove ready for anyone to dip into for tasty substance. Yummy!
386585,503259,2013/8/20,5,"I made this exactly as posted, and the result was a very flavorful and unique salad.  The dressing is really quite nice, and could probably work well on a green salad too.  I did not add the parmesan, however, and don&#039;t think it needed it.  This made a great take-along-to-work lunch.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT 9."
226867,503259,2014/12/19,5,"I cannot begin explain how delicious this was! I made two rather significant changes:&lt;br/&gt;When the hot couscous was sitting in the pot minding its own business, I added two left-over sliced venison  kielbasa. (change 1) And change 2 - served it warm. Everything else was as stated, but it was SO good! That happened to be what kind of sausage we had, but any type of pre-cooked sausage would probably be good, as well. It&#039;s just too darn cold to make this into a chilled salad! thanks, Twissis - made for her football pool win 2014"
169430,511195,2014/1/4,5,"Oh Boy, is it snowing today!  I made 6 servings of this winter delight and simply love not only the  flavor and comfort factor but that it&#039;s in the small crock kept warm. DH and I have been have been taking refills all day. I used no sugar added cranberry juice and Splenda to sweeten to taste, we like it a little on the tart side. Keeper recipe for sure. :D"
227978,511195,2014/1/26,5,"Delightful!  The subtle cinnamon tones really made this a pleasant hot beverage, and the cranberry and orange flavors melded quite nicely together here.  This is a very pleasant and tasty hot beverage to offset the chill I have from the freezing weather we&#039;re having. I&#039;m so glad I ran across this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Sharon123.  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
381180,506854,2014/12/13,5,"Really good, and quickly made in about 40 minutes!  I used chicken broth because I had an open carton, and red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno.  The bisque was naturally sweet from the onions, carrots and sweet potato, so I garnished with lime wedges.  The bit of lime juice at the table gave it a bright finish!

242766,506854,2015/12/23,5,"We loved this quick, easy, flavorful soup.  It is very similar to a favorite soup that we get at a local deli. I made it as written except that I added a little extra heavy cream for more creaminess.  Also, I cooked up some 3-cheese tortellini and added it to the soup as I always do when serving tomato soups.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.  **Made for 2015 Football Pool**"
895132,499331,2014/4/18,5,"Yum! I made these gluten free and used whole millet flour for the whole wheat, using 1 tablespoon less than 1/4 cup so it didn&#039;t become dry. For the shortening I used non-hydrogenated margarine. I make small cookies, so I got 48 out of this. Love them, they&#039;re really yummy :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1783373,501856,2014/2/6,5,"Love, Love this fruit salad!  It is so clean and refreshing and a welcome treat especially from all the heavy eating from the holidays.  I used most of the fruits listed except for raspberries (none in the market) and used a little extra honey because my strawberries weren&#039;t quit ripe.  Next time I will use fresh ginger - I bet it would be even better.  I could see this being served at a dinner party after the entree to freshen-up the pallet.  Thank you Nancy&#039;s Pantry for a wonderful new addition to my repertoire of foods to make."
674022,501856,2014/5/18,0,The amount of fruit is a total of 6 cups per the Trisha Yearwood recipe
39835,497604,2013/7/15,5,"Very good scallops -- my scallops were huge, but this was a very easy and quick way to fix them. I used a white onion instead of a red onion but otherwise made as directed. Thanks for sharing!"
67728,497604,2013/7/27,5,"We eat a lot of seafood, so I&#039;m always happy to try new and different ways to prepare it. This was super-tasty, with a nice kick to it. I reduced the amount of onion, because DH shies away from dishes that have too much onion, but I probably would&#039;ve used the full amount if I was making this for just me -- the spice and onion together were great! I used Recipe#503970 for the Cajun spice. Now if only I could figure out how to properly brown my scallops, all would be right with the world... Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9"
7211484,524962,2017/4/3,0,"Is that one cup of cooked brown rice or one cup of brown rice , cooked, which would be about 2 cups.....not feeling the sweet potato either.....but I think I'll give it a go as a have a lone sweet potato waiting to be used."
296809,497604,2013/9/1,5,"Made for the Goddesses of ZWT-9 &amp; Family Picks - I wanted to make these tasty scallops during the Cajun part of the Tour, but I also wanted to put a bit of my own spin on the prep &amp; presentation, so I decided to wait for Family Picks. Like another reviewer, I used white onion that I lightly caramelized &amp; then removed from the pan to cook the scallops. This method produced a lovely caramel color w/o overcooking the scallops. I served them to dinner guests as part of a multi-recipe starter tasting-plate, so I dressed up the presentation w/tasting spoons, bits of crisped bacon &amp; lemon zest. The bits of bacon idea came from a restaurant experience &amp; adds a salty crunch we liked a lot. My guests were very impressed &amp; I was a proud hostess. Thx for sharing your recipe w/us."
2001493928,530364,2017/4/17,5,"This pasta tastes like it was made with love; I'm surpised that's not listed as one of the ingredients! It's my favorite dish that my husband makes for me. He made it for me when we first started dating, after organizing a Valentine's day treasure hunt that was chock full of surprises. This was his grand finale. Love love love this dish! Try it :-)"
222478,496158,2013/7/13,5,Yum! The corn and chorizo was a great addition. Pickled jalapeno isn&#039;t widely available locally so I used a tomato / chili based salsa instead.
2002369939,528696,2018/12/17,0,"Very good recipe. I used Trader Joes corn medley and added a little fresh sweet bell pepper , but it was great."
2889093,501210,2013/7/4,5,It&#039;s awesome desert I used white chocolate pudding very good!!!
2000006263,519642,2015/2/18,5,Absolutely the BESTEST cookies ever. They are so fresh tasting and chewy. I added 1 tsp of ginger too....awesome X2
2000161031,519642,2015/4/23,5,"Fantastic recipe!!!! Kids, husband and I ALL love them. I used maple and brown sugar oatmeal, and all other ingredients except nuts. They are SO GOOD. These cookies are going to become a favorite around here for sure. Easy too!!!! :) :) YUM"
2000225119,519642,2015/5/25,5,"YUM!  I made a double batch and used 9 packets of Cinnamon Spice and 3 packets of Maple &amp; Brown Sugar.   Because of the cinnamon spice oatmeal, I omitted the tsp. of cinnamon in the recipe.  I omitted the nuts and raisins, too.   It was a little thick when I doubled it, so I added a little extra milk - no more than a tbsp.   They were so easy and an instant hit.   I will definitely be making these again."
2000400493,519642,2015/8/13,4,"I used 3 maple and brown sugar and 3 apple cinnamon, I omitted the extra brown sugar and white sugar, cinnamon, and honey. I added an extra tablespoon of vanilla. I omitted the ingredients because the instant oatmeal packets have enough sugar and flavor. This recipe was great to give me something to follow. The cookies were delicious."

2000535326,519642,2015/11/8,5,I made a double batch with 12 packets of pumpkin oatmeal. Omitted the honey and raisins. So good! My fianc&eacute; and I love them!
2000839534,519642,2016/1/26,4,"These were pretty tasty! I used 9 packets of plain Quaker oatmeal, so I increased the other ingredients accordingly. Omitted the honey, just because. I used a couple tablespoons of plain applesauce instead of the milk and  1/2 an egg I would&#039;ve needed, and instead of extra cinnamon I threw in 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. The flavor was great! The only thing I regretted was flattening the cookies before baking... The second batch I made were much larger cookies and I piled the dough high without any flattening and they held up much better. Definitely a good recipe to use if you don&#039;t have any old fashioned oats to use!"
2000920499,519642,2016/3/15,4,"Very yummy! Delicious, in fact. But, the prep time took a bit more time then expected. Though definitely worth it."
2001091443,519642,2016/7/17,5,"Easy and delicious. I used Bisquick for the flour, so I left out the baking soda and baking powder. Used chopped dried dates for my fruit and extra cinnamon. The recipe made a lot of cookies with just the right amount of crispy and chewy. I will make these again!"
2001192603,519642,2016/10/3,5,I am an amateur cook/baker and this recipe was absolutely awesome. I used peaches and cream instant oatmeal packets which gave the cookies a fruity taste. I found the recipe very easy to follow and my family enjoyed it.
2001353327,519642,2017/1/15,5,"Great recipe, I used 3 packets each of cranberry and brown sugar flavors. They were great !! I'll be trying different flavors in the future...btw, the directions say &quot;brown butter&quot; , but I think you meant to say brown sugar............."
2001622589,519642,2017/7/11,5,"Love it! I started with pumpkin spice oatmeal packets since I had bought several on sale. I doubled the recipe. 12 packs of pumpkin, then instead of flour, I processed two packets of cinnamon spice into flour and used that. Instead of butter, I pur&eacute;ed two of those plastic serving cups of diced peaches. Skipped the white and brown sugar, but added 2 T of honey. Added a little vanilla and pumpkin pie spice. Added the soda, powder, eggs, and milk. Didn't flatten too much, and baked about 12 minutes. Got 49 cookies, and they calculate out to about 65 calories each. And they taste amazing!!"
2001754215,519642,2017/10/16,5,"This recipe is great!! My 10 year old daughter helped me, we had fun making these and making memories!!"

2001836519,519642,2017/12/3,0,4 packets of Cocoa/almond oatmeal and rest with plain quick oats. Omitted vanilla (had none) replaced with So. Comfort... Cocoa powder for cinnamon and 1/3 c. Graham flour substitute. To the flour and pecans and a bit less sugar baked in loaf pan
2002225437,519642,2018/7/21,5,"I used organic oats and flaxseed instant. (maple and brown sugar), instead of honey, I used 100% maple syrup. They are DELICIOUS! Thank you."
169430,498832,2013/10/5,5,"I tagged this recipe on just the ingredients. To to totally I didn&#039;t really feel like massaging the kale so I lightly steamed it (sorry Jan). It was steamed just long enough to soften it a bit, nowhere near limp. We had the first hard frost of the year today and the temp was -5 until about 1pm and I ate the salad with the kale still warm and have to say that I loved it that way. Everything in it was yummy and I think I&#039;ll do it again tomorrow. :D"
412162,526764,2016/7/3,5,"These are the exact same cookies we had in my elementary school cafeteria back in the 60's. It's hard to believe I FINALLY found the recipe after all these years. My sister and brother (1 and 2 yrs younger than I) have often fondly mentioned these cookies over years. It was hard to search for them because we weren't sure if these ball-shaped things were cookies or a candy (LOL!). And they're surprisingly easy to make. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
526411,505907,2013/9/7,5,"This was easy and quick.  I had never thought of adding spices to my whipped topping before.  This was really good; we ate it on top of pecan pie.  It would be good on pecan, apple, sweet potato, or pumpkin, too.  I tried it in my home made latte and didn&#039;t like that, however.  Only because of the texture of the spices when i drank it.  I made this for New Kids on the Block tag game.  I am a horrible picture taker, but this looked really nice in person."
2001622485,532044,2017/7/12,5,"I have made this recipe twice and each time for a large group of people. Both times, I received rave reviews. It's great and easy."
2675725,505640,2013/8/13,4,This is an easy recipe with easy to find ingredients.  I made it as written except I saut&eacute;ed the onions separate (for my daughter-in-law who cannot eat onions due to diet restrictions).  The seasonings need to be jacked up a bit.  Would suggest adding peanut sauce or peanut butter and maybe marinating the chicken before cooking with a honey/soy marinade.  I served it over Chinese style noodles.
39835,493539,2013/3/4,4,I really liked this simple to make stew even though I had to skip some of the ingredients that I do not have access to. So good and so easy and a great pantry dish! Thanks for sharing!
381180,515425,2014/4/27,5,"Nice flavor, crumb and crust!  I admit it!  I mixed this on the dough cycle of my ABM.  I have a Kitchenaid mixer, but the ABM is much more convenient.  I made the recipe as written, EXCEPT I added 3/4 teaspoon salt, and made the dough into 21 small sandwich thins topped with toasted sesame seeds, instead of shaping it into a loaf.  I baked the thins at 400F for 10 minutes.  Tagged as a Preemie adoption, Spring PAC 2014."
1680722,515425,2014/5/7,5,"That&#039;s wonderful! The steps are very clear and it was easy to follow the the procedure.&lt;br/&gt;I added about 1/2 teaspoon salt, as I&#039;m used to salted bread.&lt;br/&gt;I used my knead machine and followed exactly the steps and speeds as described.  This is an easy way to prepare bread and you have only just to wait for rising and baking time.&lt;br/&gt;I can really recommend this recipe and adapt it for the different sizes and shapes you like; you have only to adjust the cooking time!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for posting your recipe."
137302,515425,2014/5/9,5,This recipe made a very good bread.  I liked everything about it.  However I used my ABM to mix and knead the dough then baked it in my oven.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
350334,515425,2018/3/9,0,"Just made this bread today and it is great! Soft inside and crusty outside...am eating a slice right now! Made EXACTLY according to the recipe including bake-time (which I thought was a little longer than other recipes but went with it and it is perfect) and used Red Star Platinium Superior Baking Yeast...this yeast has bread enhancers in it. This loaf does not have a strong yeast flavor which I never cared for in home made breads...and this bread tastes much better than store bought. Going to have another slice with my dinner! Thanks, TJfromFL for sharing!"
560491,499551,2013/5/16,5,"Very tasty!!  I loved the marinade, not too sweet or salty.  I liked the use of the lemon pepper and garlic powder and I left out the salt since the marinade had soy sauce.  Grill time was perfect.  Will make this easy recipe again!  Made for Photo Tag."

I wanted to use the ground chicken I got on sale - and I had some Frank&#039;s hot sauce in the fridge, however we didn&#039;t have any rolls, so we just piled our meatballs on bread and topped with the blue cheese and had meatball sandwiches instead of subs -- served with chips. Great meal! Thanks for sharing!"
1419314,515677,2014/5/6,5,"Just tried this tonight.  Scrumptious!  I got rave reviews from my family.  One thing I really like about this way of doing pot pie is that you mix the chicken bites with the herbs and olive oil before cooking.  It made the meat within the pie so flavorful. Also, Tabasco&#039;s helpful hints were right on...she anticipates what we might do to mess it up, and warns you ahead of time.  That kind of thing makes this home-cook-generated web site so special... you feel you are standing right in the kitchen with the cook learning the do&#039;s and don&#039;ts.  Thank you for this keeper."
1751447,525743,2016/5/17,3,"This seems like a good recipe, but what in the world do you mean by &quot;French liqueur&quot;? Last time I checked there were about a million varieties of French liqueur. I guess I could just choose one I like..."
1802495731,500135,2014/2/16,4,"New vegan here, but this recipe served as the basis for a very successful attempt at a vegan &quot;remake&quot; my cajun red beans and rice recipe. I made six sausages instead of just four, as the size more closely resembled the cajun hot sausages I would normally use in size, smell and look. They needed to steam a little more than 45 minutes - at least for my steamer. All in all with a bit of additional spices, these were a big hit. Everyone had seconds!"
424680,510490,2013/12/27,5,"Made these up shortly after tagging the recipe and they were a big hit with several neighbors! I did, however, have to read through the recipe carefully and make notes in the margins, and pretty much followed your tips and suggestions. The result was some outrageously great cinnamon rolls! Your recipe is a definite keeper! Many thanks for sharing it! [Made and reviewed in Please Review My Recipe]"
695933,500822,2013/12/16,5,"Spiced Bacon Twist or candied bacon may sound wrong, but it&#039;s oh so right! To make this easy recipe, all you need to do is coat bacon with a sugar and spice mixture and bake it until it&#039;s crispy. The resulting treat is simultaneously chewy and crunchy, sweet and salty, and completely addicting.  I bake anywhere from 6 to 9 lbs of bacon for our family &amp; friends Christmas breakfast just the way you describe except that I use the parchment paper for 2 rounds of baking before changing it out. It truly is the best way to cook bacon. I like to mention sprinkling it all with some brown sugar toward the end of baking ? heavenly! The hunters here today love it for breakfast! Thank You!

743849,498649,2013/11/14,0,"I&#039;m going to post my review without leaving stars because I&#039;m not sure I followed the recipe correctly: I couldn&#039;t figure out where to use the flour listed in the ingredients, so I dusted the chicken with the flour prior to dipping the chicken into the egg. I had to use two eggs instead of one egg for all four pieces of chicken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The onion crumble made a decent &quot;breading&quot;, but it started to burn on a couple of my chicken breasts after 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Luckily, I used thin-sliced chicken cutlets, so my chicken was cooked all the way through. It might have been trickier had I been using a thicker breast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end result was crunchy and good; both my husband and I thought it was bland. If I make this again (it&#039;s easy and a good way to use up the end of a can of fried onions), I will season the flour (salt, pepper, garlic powder, etc) to jazz up the chicken just a little bit."
88099,508212,2014/5/4,5,Excellent and I didn&#039;t miss the light breading at all.  It had the perfect a amount of lemon flavor for us.  I would not change a thing about this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PAC Spring 2014
865936,502841,2013/8/20,4,I served this with some spicy grilled corn on the cob.  It was very complimentary.  I was in the mood for something coconut-y and this fit the bill.
496803,502841,2013/8/22,4,"I served this with Thai chicken skewers, expecting the sweet to offset any heat in the chicken.  It wasn&#039;t as sweet as I expected, and the coconut flavor muted a bit as well. It was good, but didn&#039;t really blow my socks off.  Made for ZWT9"
361931,502841,2013/8/24,4,"Made this to see what it would taste like, and get an idea of what I could use to serve it with...  wasn&#039;t quite as sweet as I expected it to be, but I could see using it to compliment mildly spicy dishes (as another reviewer said, not sure it is quite sweet enough, or quite strong enough to offset serious heat), or even as a starting base for other sauces (such as a sauce for coconut shrimp -- YUM)."
383346,502841,2013/8/25,5,I made a small batch for me to use on grilled corn and it was so good.  Thanks Twissis :)  Made for ZWT9
135566,493022,2013/4/13,5,Easy and delicious broccoli.  I will definitely be making this recipe again. Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef.
653438,493022,2013/4/17,5,I fixed this last night to go with our dinner and I did cut the recipe in half but ohhhhhhh so tasty.  Who would have thought to add bacon!  Definately a keeper.  Made for Spring PAC 2013.
1706426,493022,2013/4/18,5,"Very good! I did drain the bacon fat, though.I used 1/3 c. water, covered and basically steamed for about ten minutes. I figured the scraps on the bottom of the pan, along with the bacon bits was plenty of bacon flavor, and it worked well for me Thanks for sharing! Made for Spring PAC 2013"
323186,493022,2013/4/23,5,"I took this a little further,  as I cooked the bacon I slightly par-cooked the broccoli in a pot of water before adding it to the bacon, then used the water to cook penne.  Once the penne was cooked, I tossed everything together for a truly scrumptious but oh-so-simple pasta dinner.  I scattered a few slivered almonds on top.   Thank you,  Joy,  this was so good!   made for I Recommend tag game"
2755882,495588,2013/3/26,5,"mmmmm...they are deliciously yummy,follow the recipe ....especially the baking time and they will be chewy,my kids love them to (they love smores when we go camping over the bonfire to) .....and yup me too,a fav cookie and raw dough yum"
2209112,524983,2015/12/7,5,I made this dish yesterday for dinner and every one love it.  I wish I would have bough double the bread to soak up all the delicious sauce.
2210917,524983,2015/12/7,5,The crunchy pine nuts are such a great addition to the basil tomato sauce. YUM!
2211309,524983,2015/12/7,5,This recipe is delicious! I made it and all anyone wanted was more! I will defiantly make this again!
2215436,524983,2015/12/7,5,What a quick dinner recipe.  I love that it will be ready in no time!
2215432,524983,2015/12/7,5,"This is really a complete meal with the addition of the eggs and chickpeas, and you can never go wrong with spaghetti sauce."
2212465,524983,2015/12/7,4,"Can&#039;t wait to try this recipe, it is so different and full of flavor!"

2212462,524983,2015/12/7,5,YUM!! loving this recipe
296809,503240,2013/8/4,5,"Made as written for the Goddesses of ZWT-9 &amp; we really liked this bread. It was slathered w/butter &amp; tasted warm from the ABM. It is a very dense bread &amp; I am sure will make excellent toast in the morning. There were tense moments early on as my ABM groaned, jerked a bit &amp; finally stopped -- BUT after the addition of 2 extra tbsp of the rm temp beer, all went well. Our condo smelled like a bakery &amp; I&#039;m sure our neighbors were jealous. Thx for sharing your recipe for this delicious bread."
1474152,503240,2015/10/11,5,"I finally found a limpa rye that works for me! All others have been dried bricks. Keep a little beer from the can handy, as you might need to add a couple tablespoons more like I did. I also gave the seeds a little grind in the mortar to release their flavor and I will be adding a teaspoon more of each because I like lots of seasoning. Thank you Mikekey!"
1624278,507489,2013/10/5,5,this is the best red cabbage recipe eer
400407,502398,2017/8/13,5,"Fabulous! great flavor, I skipped the Vanilla and Sugar and spread with a bit of onion and chive cream cheese before rolling. Next time i would leave in the blender and give it a quick mix before every pour as the batter separates quickly."
2000498330,510839,2017/3/19,4,"Easy, good, basic pot of lentils. Great with crusty homemade bread. The cloves added a subtle flavor-could take or leave them."
163112,493794,2013/2/18,4,"The end result of how I cooked this was off the charts fabulous.  BUT there is no way in the world I am cooking any green, especially tender swiss chard, for 1 hour or more.  SO, I boiled the wheat berries in salted water until *almost* cooked, then drained them.  I sauteed the onion (no leeks), stems, added all the rest except the leaves.  I let that cook until the liquid absorbed, getting the crusty bottom.  THEN I added the leaves & stirred them in until wilted & served.  I would add more pomegranate molasses next time.  This is a super yummy combo that we ate & ate & ate & ate....then it was gone.  :(  Made for Sun & Spice Tag 2.2013."
323186,513928,2014/3/7,5,"Ridiculously easy recipe which we both loved and highly recommended!    I might have liked mine a little more spicy but DH said perfect as is!   I hope you dont mind that I had to sub red pepper for the carrot, not realising that I had no carrots until I started preparations,  the pepper was good and I will happily use carrots another time!  Thank you for sharing a very special recipe that can easily be enjoyed any night of the week, made for PRMR tag game!"
128473,513928,2017/5/23,5,Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe Teresa. We enjoyed this dish very much. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the flavor was amazing. This is very quick and easy to make. I highly recommend this tasty treat. Made for Went To Market Tag game. 2017
143318,500845,2013/6/28,4,"Very good! My lentils took longer than 15 minutes to cook all the way through, but still a quick and healthy weeknight meal."
2924260,500845,2013/7/30,5,"This was so tasty and easy. I sauteed the onion in the oil first, then added the ginger/garlic paste once they were starting to brown (then added the seeds). My 14 month old loved it too! Not too spicy for him like many of the curry recipes I&#039;ve tried. Will definitely make frequently - and double the recipe. Didn&#039;t make much if eating as the main meal"
679953,494131,2013/4/14,5,"This really made for a nice syrup this morning on some pancakes for us.  So nice and simple, but the lemon flavor really added some fantastic flavors, that gave this a zing.  Tagged and made for PRMR Tag."
128473,494131,2013/7/30,5,"This blackberry infused maple syrup was wonderful.  It was perfect, smooth, light and flavorful.  It filled all the nicks and crannies of my waffles.

329769,503991,2013/7/21,5,Reviewed for ZWT9- an easy recipe to prepare and cook. Made as written (though minus the mushrooms as I realised that I didn&#039;t have any at the last minute). Served over basmati rice for a tasty and hearty vege meal. Photo also to be posted
144373,503991,2013/7/23,5,"Very flavorful vegetables, loved the combination of vegetables with the basmati rice.  Made as written, except for the cornstarch. For the Holy Trinity Cooking Challenge.  For ZWT-9 - The Apron String Travelers"
480195,503991,2013/7/27,5,What a delicious way to serve a vegetarian dinner and not miss meat at all. We thoroughly enjoyed this meal and I will be making it again often. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
80353,503991,2013/8/28,5,I actually used this as a side that incorporated both veggies and starch to accompany fish.  Very easy to make and very tasty.
107583,500263,2013/5/18,5,Easy method and great results.  I made the Cinnamon and the Ginger.  Both are great and the ginger version I had to keep myself from eating it by the spoonful.  Will be using these in tea and the ginger version I will try in lemonade.  Going to do some of these during the holidays for gifts.
37449,512751,2014/2/3,5,"All the flavors of buffalo wings, but without the meat! Much enjoyed. Thanks!"
1179225,512751,2014/2/7,5,"Yummmmy.....fun and decadent. I had to substitute Lighthouse blue cheese dressing for the crumbles, but that worked great. The only change I&#039;ll make next time would be to skip salting the potatoes, everything else was perfect. Thanks for posting the recipe."
1072593,523848,2016/8/17,5,OMG now I'm scared! What new hummus recipe could I possibly find? Vegemite-chipotle? Jalapeno-Sashimi? Tarantula-sun dried tomato? All sounds good to me. Good truffle hummus!
2000424257,498243,2015/8/23,0,The fifth ingredient in this &quot;Soy-Free&quot; meatballs is soy sauce.??!!
242766,503297,2015/1/10,5,"We really enjoyed these easy and tasty red beans and sausage.  I used the &quot;quick soak&quot; method for soaking the beans by bringing the beans &amp; water to a boil for 2 minutes, removing the pot from the heat and allowing the beans to soak, covered, for 1 hour. I used Cajun andouille smoked sausage and 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  I would have liked them spicier but I didn&#039;t dare add more red pepper flakes or my husband wouldn&#039;t have eaten it.  I didn&#039;t have a meaty ham bone, so I added a couple tablespoons of ham base instead. I served this over brown steamed rice and with cornbread on the side.  As soon as my husband tasted this, he commented that it reminded him of something he had one time at the &quot;House of Blues&quot; restaurant in New Orleans.  Thank you for sharing this keeper recipe.  **Made for 2014 Football Pool**"
128473,515356,2014/4/23,5,"We really enjoyed this tasty rub.  I served it on thick lean pork chops , which I roasted in the oven.  Wow, were they ever good.  I can&#039;t wait to try this rub on grilled chicken breasts.  The rub was quick and easy to make with ingredients always found in my pantry. Thank you so much for sharing. Made for Spring Pac 2014."
400708,515356,2014/4/26,5,"After reading BK&#039;s review knew I needed to try this.  I served on boneless pork chops and grilled outside, so good and just that little different with the sweet and spicy combo.  I did add a little extra cayenne pepper about a total of 1 teaspoon as DH likes his extra spicy and it was perfect for us.  We&#039;ll be using this often when grilling season is here.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
307214,515356,2014/4/28,4,Easy but a little too sweet for our family.  We had it on very thick pork chops.
137302,515356,2014/5/3,5,This is a wonderful tasting rub.  I plan to use it the next time I make roasted chicken on the rotisserie.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
2585084,499386,2013/4/28,5,I smeared this creamy concoction all over toast and topped it with banana slices.  Yummy!
695933,499386,2013/11/24,5,"Really good and very easy to make. I add vanilla extract to it and we use it on baked potatoes. To do butter with some amazing flavor I love it any time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 tsp cinnamon&lt;br/&gt;    1/2 C peaches, chopped&lt;br/&gt;    1/2 C bluberries, smashed&lt;br/&gt;    Beat together honey, butter and vanilla for 10 minutes until light and fluffy&lt;br/&gt;    Add in flavor of choice - cinnamon, peach or blueberry&lt;br/&gt;    Mix until well blended and refrigerate until ready to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet butters are delicious on breakfast foods: toast, bagels, muffins, pancakes, waffles et al. They also are delicious on crackers or biscuits for snacks or tea. &lt;br/&gt;You Got Inspired to do a new recipe with this, It is absolutely over the Top!!"
128473,536070,2018/10/3,5,"Delicious scones Bonnie, absolutely delicious. Quick and easy to make also. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe that I will enjoy often. The glaze is the perfect topping for this wonderful treat. Made FYC tag game."

1802979607,494258,2014/7/30,4,"I used a good fish stock rather than clam juice as it&#039;s hard to get hold of in the UK and expensive when you can get it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It went down well in this house and has been requested again today, which has prompted me to review it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic dried breadcrumbs were used and the whole dish worked wonderfully."
169430,503976,2014/4/30,5,"So Good. I didn&#039;t have porterhouse steaks but I did have, and used, large 1 inch thick New York strips. I made the butter a couple of days ago and it had lots of wonderful flavor this evening. The grilled steak is simply delicious cooked to a perfect med-rare with that great melting butter. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
1706426,505062,2013/8/28,4,"Quite good, but I did change a few things. I added an egg to the cheese mixture and some basil. Also I was too lazy, not to mention hungry (!) to make my own pasta, so I used a boxed pasta. Thanks for sharing, made for PRMR 2013"

133174,505062,2013/10/22,5,Fantastic idea!  The flavors of this dish are dependent upon a good rich sauce.  I used 2 boxed gluten free noodles and with a salad this made 2 servings for me.  Cottage cheese was whipped and used in place of the ricotta.  A touch of ground nutmeg was added to the cheese filling.  I like the idea of making lasagna rolls and freezing them.  Thank you for a great meal for one.  Made for Aussie Swap.

2002160578,532391,2018/5/21,5,I've been GF before GF was cool. Making GF pizza crust dough is such a drag &amp; high carb to boot.

1802622608,514925,2014/3/27,5,This is one of my favorite dishes. It&#039;s perfect for large parties and especially around the holidays!
1802622636,514925,2014/3/27,5,Comforting and delicious.  This is a great easy side dish or potluck meal!
1802622712,514925,2014/3/27,5,"Delicious, comforting, and so easy to make! Minimal prep and mess, and you probably have most of the ingredients already. Would definitely make again as an easy family meal side dish or for a potluck. Can&#039;t wait to try the breakfast suggestion!"
1802623021,514925,2014/3/27,0,"With 5 ingredients and a 10-minute prep time, this baked potato casserole fits the bill for large family get-togethers. I would serve it as a side with omelets and fruit for brunch, or steak and salad for dinner. The green chiles add the perfect punch of flavor to this simple and savory dish, too! Loved it!"
1802622634,514925,2014/3/28,5,I tried this last night and it was delish! Thanks for posting!
2597942,510088,2013/12/2,5,"I made these wraps today for lunch for hubby and I. I felt kinda silly when I asked the man at the deli to give me just 4 slices of Gouda cheese... but it didn&#039;t seem to phase him (I had no idea that cheese is quite pricey). I cheated and added 2 slices of bacon to each of the wraps (we love bacon). I thinly sliced a Granny Smith apple (that&#039;s all I had), and used the last of our Thanksgiving turkey in the fridge (not counting what I froze last week). I had bagged baby greens which had arugula, red &amp; green lettuces, etc. On mine I also added some very thinly sliced red onion. These wraps are very tasty. I&#039;m trying to figure out a good condiment that would work with them just to add a little moisture. I was almost tempted to smear the tortillas with my left-over Recipe #509843, but I didn&#039;t. I think it would have been pretty good. We enjoyed these. Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
226867,510088,2014/12/13,5,"Made a little adjustment - I only had some small tortillas, so I made sandwiches with whole wheat bread. Yum! I&#039;ll try as a wrap another time!"
242766,510088,2016/10/17,5,"This wrap made a very tasty, light, and healthy lunch. I really loved the salty/ sweet combination of the apple and bacon. I used a garden spinach herb tortilla, honey roasted turkey, gala apple and spring mix for the baby greens. Loved it! Thank you for sharing. **Made for 2016 Football Pool**"

182312,514011,2018/4/18,4,"Made as directed, no tweaks. Flavor turned out great. Nice and custardy kind of on the inside the way it should be. It never really got super crunchy like the stuff you get at the food stalls, but I’m not sure if that is due to the recipe or my pan. Thx!"
1553277,501758,2014/7/18,5,These biscotti are tender crisp and so flavourful.  I love making biscotti because they stay fresh for so long.
1802940935,501758,2014/7/21,5,This is now my favorite biscotti recipe.
348402,514889,2015/5/30,4,Thought this was very good.  Next time I will make more than 1lb of fish for 4 people though.... it fed 2 little kids and 2 adults..but the adults would have preferred more fish.  ;)  Also..I think I would only use the juice of 1/2 a lime...as much as I love lime it was overwhelming the mango flavor.  I served over short grain brown rice along with a small corn tortilla for wrapping.
898893,514889,2017/7/31,5,"Wow - great blackened fish! I did not make the salsa, but this will be my goto recipe for blackened fish rub! Also I did not finish in the oven searing on both sides was perfect."
498271,505283,2013/10/8,5,This is a great and easy salsa!  Nice and spicy and loved the addition of the lime.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

2001150335,505283,2016/9/1,5,I have tried so many &quot;On the Boarder&quot; recipes and this one is a grande slam! It is as close to the actual OTB salsa that I have ever tried. The OTB salsa itself is a bit to spicy for me so I cut the cayenne pepper in half. Once done I tried it right out of the blender (okay but nothing special) then let it sit for an hour or so and BAM. Flavors all across the board! If you like salsa in general then try this! My roommates and I have already eaten the whole serving in about 8 hours (all 3 of us really love good salsa)
2002255039,505283,2018/8/23,5,Thank you!! This is delicious just like On the Border’s.
2002153007,512316,2018/5/15,5,Made this soup tonight and it is delicious. I soaked the beans. Cooked for 35 min and then letting pot sit for 10min before I let pressure release. I used spinach because I couldn’t find escarole. The broth is rich and tasty. Adding the sherry vinegar made the soup bright tasting. Highly recommend. I’m sure if you want to make this vegan you can add smoked paprika instead of the chorizo. But please make it with chorizo. This is truly amazing. So flavorful. I’m keeping this in the rotation.
226863,502812,2014/12/18,5,"I made this as posted, except I used olive salad from Central Grocery in New Orleans instead of the pickled veggies and olives.

My first run with homemade dough came out wrong, but tonight I tried making them with the skull pan and store bought sheet dough and they look great. I had a couple leak but that was my own fault. Definitely worth a try for anyone who wants a bunch of pizza pockets for the fridge, freezer or just to eat for dinner."
1680722,503128,2014/4/4,5,"Dear Kato, these biscotti are really delicious! Not too sweet, crunchy but not too hard and tasty.&lt;br/&gt;I prepared the recipe as suggersted I only added some sesame seed on the loafs before making the incisions.&lt;br/&gt;The steps were easy, did not need a lot of time to prepare them, excluding the drying time in the oven.&lt;br/&gt;I will keep this recipe for safe and I will adopt it to make variations on  this as the dough is really perfect.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for posting this recipe!"
323186,535831,2018/9/12,5,"This was FABULOUS!!! We are so in love, and my daughter wants the recipe. I didn't know you could make dumplings, said my husband! aha :) Minor changes, I used fresh carrots, diced, because I had them, I also added a thinly sliced red onion, ditto. I added these with the chicken. I decided to add a dash of red pepper flakes because my husband does enjoy a bit of a bite. Otherwise, as recipe, and oh, so good. Thank you for sharing!!!!"
305531,503636,2013/7/24,5,Great shanks. I made as directed but used fresh mint from the garden and used a mixture of Greek olives that I got at the deli. Simple and so good. Thanks loof for sharing. Made for ZWT9.
593927,503971,2013/7/15,5,Very nice buttery oatmeal cookies. I used all organic ingredients however the recipe certainly made more than it says but that may be due to me making a half batch with a whole egg. I may make these again insha Allah (God willing).
2000999552,535267,2018/9/29,5,"Thank you for this wonderful recipe. Its quick and easy and really good!!! We've used it over veggies, pasta and even made cheesy french fries!!! Thanks again!! :-)"
1020526,501324,2014/8/10,5,"I found this recipe in Taste of Home 2008 Annual Recipes.  I added a bunch more cilantro.  I tried it with a nice crusty bread, but I preferred dipping chips in it.  Tasty stuff.  Thanks for posting!"
280271,501653,2013/9/19,5,This is so delicious...packed full of Vietnamese taste...this is differently a soup...I had leftover ground pork so that is what I used...but I bet the ground turkey would be yummy too! I cut the recipe down to serve 2 and there was plenty...I used soft soba noodles...what was really surprising was how the hubby raved about it...I cooked my patties on the George Foreman Grill...this is a keeper and going in my best of 2013 cookbook...thanks for posting it...=)
50509,501653,2014/1/26,5,"Very delicious. I did things a little differently, but it still turned out well. I had made the patties earlier in the day. I put all the ingredients for the sauce/broth in a small saucepan (used a ripe jalapeno, as I had not serrano), tossed in the patties and after it came to a simmer, added some rice noodles. Once all was done, I transferred to a dish which had my torn Boston lettuce leaves and cilantro in it. The broth was very flavorful and the red jalapeno bits looked attractive. Oh, I used some agave syrup instead of cooking up the water and sugar, just a matter of available time.  Definitely something I would do again."

Just warmed my heart to think that PammyOwl is looking down from heaven watching all of us continuing her cooking legacy.  Me and my family really enjoyed these darling creamsicles.  I couldn&#039;t believe that I forgot to add both the vanilla and orange extract and realized it when it was too late (already frozen), but not to fear because they were still GOOD!  I especially loved the addition of the coconut milk-Yummers.  PammyOwl, may your soul rest in peace and thank you for adding warmth to my heart tonight when tasting your creamsicles:)"
461834,492931,2013/3/31,5,"OMG!!!  The smell of this meat while it was being grilled was so good!!!  I made it for dinner for our DS and his girlfriend and we were all drooling from the smell while DH grilled it, which also was cooked to perfection, medium-rare to medium throughout the steak!!  I am giving it 5 stars despite it being too salty.  I thought, as I was making this marinade, that 6 teaspoons (2 Tablespoons) seasoned salt was going to be too much(even though I love salt and especially Lawry&#039;s seasoned salt), but thought maybe with the amount of beef broth it would dilute it enough, but all 4 of us found it too salty.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I would use about half of all the ingredients(as I felt it made more then needed for the amount of steak) and then 1/2 the seasoned salt again.  Also suggest using low sodium soy sauce and next time will use &quot;Better then Beef Bouillon&quot;(has 1/3 less salt then normal bouillons) rather then a canned beef broth.  This has a wonderful flavor combination and think had I used my initial gut feeling and gone less salt, it would have been one of the best marinated flanks steaks!!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for 2013 &quot;Pick A Chef&quot; event."
2597942,492931,2013/5/2,5,"This was excellent! I marinated last night, and made this for lunch today. I actually made 2 smallish flank steaks, but there was more than enough marinade for them both. (I turned and tossed them a few times in the baggie over the course of approx 15 hours). I used another reviewers advice and cut the seasoning salt down to 1 tablespoon. I&#039;m glad I did. Between the beef broth, seasoning salt and soy sauce, it was plenty salty! I made them under my oven broiler (since it is storming here), but they worked out great! I sliced one thinly, across the grain, and used it on top of crisp, fresh salads for hubby and I. we both loved it. The other I am saving to have for dinner tomorrow night and eat as a &quot;steak&quot;. I plan to make some fried onion slices in EVOO and Lawry&#039;s seasoning salt (those are the best) to serve over the top. Thank you for posting such a terrific marinade. I plan to use it again. (Made for PAC - Spring 2013)"
305531,492931,2014/2/11,5,"Yummy! I marinated my steak overnight and reduced the amount of seasoning based on prior reviews. Because of the weather, I grilled this on a stove top grill pan. Very nice marinade.  Thanks for sharing. Made for Best of 2013 Tag."
1436160,492931,2014/3/3,5,"I used this on sirloin steak that was a bit old. I reduced the seasoning salt to 1 tablespoon,  used low sodium salt, and Better than Beef Bouillon. The steak were  marinated overnight, then grilled in what the prelude to what I hope is our last &quot;snow event&quot; of this winter. The steak was very flavorful. Thanks for sharing. Made for Best of 2013 tag."
280271,512757,2014/2/22,5,I made sliders...my pork was still on the firm side after 7 hours so I turned the crock pot on high...after a half hour I was able to shed the meat...I left it on high for an additional half hour...I liked it with the cabbage/onion on top...hubby didn&#039;t he said all he could taste was red onion...btw only put about 2 tbs of the mixture on top...there isn&#039;t enough for 1/2 cup of each for 4 servings...I have left overs...yummy...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
2001809775,519786,2017/11/20,0,"Is this recipe calling for egg whites only? the way it reads, it could mean use yolks and eggs, but beat the whites separately."
178427,496090,2013/3/26,5,Loved this sausage stew! I made it as written but subbed spinach for the bok choy. Great flavor and easy to make. I served it with tossed salad and garlic bread for a terrific Italian meal. Thanks for sharing. Made for PAC 2013.
482376,496993,2014/4/17,5,"Wonderful! Every recipe I have tried of yours has been fabulous, and this is not exception. This was an absolute breeze to prepare. I loved the crumb topping. Tasty!! Thank you. Made for the Spring Pick-A-Chef event in the contests and events forum."
2000596756,496993,2015/10/23,5,I love this recipe! It is not high calorie and it tastes so good! Thank you.
1644334,496993,2017/7/20,2,Too much garlic powder. Wonder if this is a typo. Should it have been teaspoons instead of tablespoons?
62494,522824,2015/11/11,5,"I really liked this recipe. I made this sandwich at the request of my partner, not really expecting to like it much.  It was much better than I expected! I did not use vegan mayo or milk, I used regular.  Also I added some blue cheese crumbles on top of the ranch layer.  It was delicious!"
1268829,532962,2018/1/4,0,How much flour do you use?
2001036169,532962,2018/1/25,5,This turned out lovely and moist! The best vegan chocolate cake I have made yet. I had never tried the trick with the vinegar and the baking soda to take the place of eggs but it worked! I adore the chocolate &quot;frosting&quot; but this cake is so good with a little dusting of powdered sugar as well.
653438,497830,2013/10/5,5,Gailanng another wonderful dish!!!  I made this for My 3 Chefs October 2013 and what a hit!  I did follow the instructions except for using recipe#359889#359889 to make a heartier salad.  The dressing is to die for.  I love avocados and here in California we have them at hand. Thank you for posting and into my Favorites of 2013.

226863,495399,2013/3/31,5,"This is a great marinade.  I will use low sodium soy salt next time as I found it a bit salty.  I could smell the bourbon in the marinade, but couldn&#039;t taste it in the chicken.  So I may increase that a bit next time.  The ginger and garlic are spot on, and it smelled so good while cooking on the grill.  My neighbors had to ask what I was grilling!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game."
285039,495399,2013/4/27,5,"Quick, easy with fabulous results.  I served this over a salad of greens, broccoli slaw mix, almonds and sesame stix with an oriental vinaigrette.  Delicious!"
400708,496983,2013/3/17,4,"I&#039;m so proud to be the first to review this recipe.  I have to admit to some concern prior to making this as was just not sure how it would turn out.  Well, have to tell you it was very good and pretty easy to make as I had left over rice from the night before already prepared.  I did cut the recipe in half for 2 of us, I used an Italian mix shredded cheese as that&#039;s what I had on hand, then added a some red bell pepper and some fresh chopped cilantro to the mix, next time might even add a little jalapeno for some extra zing. Be careful not to over steam the eggs past your desired doneness.  A very good recipe as it stands and lends itself to a wide variety of options.  Made for Spring PAC 2013"
2796729,499768,2013/5/6,5,Made these over the weekend. Easy and really good.
107135,503213,2013/8/29,5,"wow oh wow this is good didnt add as much garlic dot let the weird  ingredients  fool you ,if you like heat in the morning try this zwt9"
2235640,497404,2013/4/23,4,"This dish had a lot of flavor! We took it to my parent&#039;s house for Easter and everyone loved it, especially the texture. I don&#039;t know that it&#039;s necessary to put it in a springform pan and call it a cheesecake, next time I&#039;ll just bake in a regular baking dish. But definitely a solid, enjoyable dish."
2001797288,533168,2017/12/5,5,Never would have thought of it! It was delicious. I used a dairy free cheese and a hard boiled egg. I will be making this regularly!
226863,494570,2014/1/26,5,This is so quick and easy!  I really enjoyed the lemon flavor from the fresh lemon juice.  Wonderful with fish.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game.
286566,513947,2014/3/13,5,"The only changes I made was to omit the parsley as the recent heat wave has taken its toll on the herb garden and to sub sharp cheddar cheese finely grated for the parmesan and only used 1 egg in the crumbing for 6 chicken cutlets bone in and skin on and sprayed with a little oil instead of using the butter and baked on rack at 175C for 45 minutes for crunchy and some of the most succulent chicken we have ever had, thank you TeresaS, made for Rookie tag game."
128473,513947,2014/3/21,5,"What a lovely chicken recipe TeresaS.  We really enjoyed the chicken prepared this way.  What great flavors this had.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
2549237,499841,2013/6/14,5,Thank you for such a wonderful brisket!  I made this tonight as my husband&#039;s birthday dinner along with cabbage and roasted potatoes and everyone loved it!  I will gladly make this again for other special occasions.  Thank you very much duonyte!  Made for New Kids On The Block tag game.
1199502,510138,2014/2/21,5,Delish! Went perfectly over a lemon loaf I made. Was a little thin though so I would recommend using 2 T limoncello first and adding more if desired! Flavor was awesome!
212609,494016,2013/1/27,5,What a wonderful twist to garlic bread.....simple but devilishly effective....and very addictive!!<br/>Made for PRMR.
226863,494016,2013/2/27,5,"This bread is delicious!  I used shaved parm, and once I flipped the bread the cheese stuck to the foil.  Didn't effect the taste at all.  This is so delicious that I'd say you need to make more than you think you will eat.  I cut the recipe down by 1/3 and used 1 tsp sriracha sauce.  So mine was delectably spicy!  Thanks for sharing....made for PRMR tag."
383346,494016,2013/4/9,5,Me and DH like garlic bread so when I saw this one had sriracha I had to try it.  It was so good and spicy.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for PAC Spring 2013
131126,494016,2013/4/15,5,"I&#039;m a big fan of sriracha so when I saw this featured in Pick a chef 2013 I had to try it.  I wasn&#039;t disappointed.  It was garlicky, spicy, cheesy good!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
318262,494016,2014/1/24,5,"This is wonderful!! The ingredients come together perfectly. I didn&#039;t butter both sides, just one and broiled for a few minutes. I started only making 8 pieces and before I knew it my whole loaf was gone!"
220348,503491,2013/8/7,5,"Definetely a chocolate lover&#039;s delight. It was easy to make, and the baking time was spot on. I did find it moist, which is really great."
107135,503491,2013/8/11,5,easy good
171790,503491,2013/8/11,5,"Rich, gooey and yummy. On top of that it&#039;s very easy to make. Made for ZWT9 Soup A Stars."
124416,503491,2016/8/16,0,"Very sticky, very chocolatey, very quick, very good. Thanks, Elizabeth, very good recipe."
2001520764,503491,2017/5/4,3,"Nice but really, really (sickly) sweet. I would definitely recommend cutting back the sugar. I really like the idea of a gooey warm chocolatey cake though, so will persist with this recipe until it suits my taste."
280271,494016,2015/1/21,5,"Loved, loved, loved it...like some of the other reviewers I just buttered on one side...I also cooked my in the toaster oven...cut this way back for two servings...but this is just so easy to make that I&#039;m keeping this in my back pocket...it&#039;s a keeper...served it with recipe #454936...made for Best of 2014 tag game...thanks for posting the recipe...it&#039;s going in my best of 2015 cookbook...=)"
128473,494016,2015/1/31,5,"Wow, what a terrific recipe Sharon.  Who knew that Sriracha would be so wonderful paired with garlic and butter.  This was truly special.  We enjoyed this garlic bread very much and will be enjoying it often.  Made as written using Ciabatta Lunga bread, it was wonderful, so many crevices for the lovely butter mixture to get captured in.  We loved it with the edges charred, thank you so much for sharing another winner.  Kudos on making it into my Favorites Cookbook for 2015."
386585,494016,2015/2/3,5,"I cannot say enough good things about this bread.  The sriracha really takes it over the top, and is SOOO delicious.  Unfortunately, I think I see more bread in my diet now.  It&#039;s addictive.  Made for Best of 2014 Tag Game."
2002102760,531758,2018/4/8,0,I like ranch dressing in cucumber salad!
545717,503910,2014/3/29,0,"A very easy and tasty recipe. I love the fact that it&#039;s natural and can be sweetened  to our taste. I have also used as a filling for hand pies, delicious!"
1156979,499458,2013/5/14,5,Love these and kept a bunch of the dough too munch on too! A perfect treat for dairy free diets!
2362312,499458,2013/6/4,5,Sooo yummy!!! I added 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips for extra sweetness. Delish!!!! I&#039;m sure they&#039;re even yummy without the chocolate!! Great Recipe!!! &lt;3
2106905,499458,2013/6/9,2,"I think maybe if you HAD to go dairy and egg free then these would be ok. They are edible. I was a little skeptical of the lack of some key ingredients  but tried it anyway and I was right. Kind of gross actually. Really bad texture. I used parchment (thank God) because even still I couldn&#039;t pry them off of it. They didn&#039;t hold together well when picking them up. They tasted exactly like banana, peanut butter and oats so like I said, edible but not a good cookie. (I even added m&amp;ms and it didn&#039;t help.)"
2947543,499458,2013/8/17,4,"This is an easy peasy, yummy vegan cookie :)  It was a bit fluffy and the banana was the prominent tasting ingredient, but the kids, the dog (he&#039;s spoiled!) and I love them.  You really can&#039;t beat 5 ingredients and 15 minutes for yummy goodness!!!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for the recipe :)"
1802474181,499458,2014/2/10,4,"Nice healthy treat. They were a little lacking in flavor so I added a few sprinkles of apple pie spice. That made them much better. Cinnamon would work too. Otherwise they taste like bananas, oatmeal, and peanut butter."
642455,499458,2015/5/27,4,"I was looking for a more nutritious cookie - something like an &quot;energy cookie,&quot; and this recipe looked like a pretty good start.  I used almond butter instead of peanut butter, 1 banana &amp; 1/2 sweet potato.  (Didn&#039;t have any applesauce.) I only use the old fashioned oats - I never buy that over-processed quick-cook stuff. Didn&#039;t really measure, but stirred it all together in with a generous portion of unsweetened shredded coconut, cacao nibs, goji berries, and just a bit of maple syrup to keep it moist, and a bit of vanilla...Hmmm.  I think I added chia seeds also! Two pinches of cardamom &amp; a shake of cinnamon.  I&#039;m pleasantly surprised. :-)"
10404,492790,2013/1/4,5,"Outstanding comes to mind-that and ""need more stars"".  I set my eggs and cheese's out the night before-we keep our house cool and night so that worked perfectly for pulling this recipe together ""the morning of"".  It comes together like a dream, it is dense and creamy, and it is to die for!  I like my cheesecake plain but made a simple blackberry topping for my DH.  I'm making this for Valentines Day and may omit the 1 teaspoon vanilla extract for 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.  Then again I might not-it really is perfect ""as is"".  If your single and looking to get engaged, this is the dessert recipe for you-just be sure he or she is the one because they will hound you to make it again.  And again.  Thank you for posting this recipe (I think ;-) )"
2000351299,499458,2015/7/20,3,Not a bad cookie.  They are easy and I had everything I needed. I would add some cinnamon or something next time for more flavor.  But they made a great dairy free snack and got rid of my sweet tooth also.
2001132206,499458,2016/8/18,5,"Great start to build off of! I was craving something sweet and didn't have much to work with in my pantry, but this fit the bill! I added cinnamon, chocolate extract, and some chocolate flavored protein powder! Turned out great."
1925613,499458,2016/11/8,5,"I love this recipe!You really can't mess this up. I added more flour to make a stiffer cookie dough, cinnamon, allspice and raisens. It turned out great!"
363055,507155,2014/1/14,5,This was very tasty.  I will make again for sure.  I saut&eacute;ed chicken tenders for this.  I used red bell pepper in place of green peppers.  Next time I will add a can of black beans rinsed and drained.
655203,511606,2015/7/5,5,This was so wonderful! Thank you for the recipe! I made this for my husband&#039;s birthday since he loves bananas and we are trying to stay away from a lot of sugar. I did add a little bit (like  2 tbsp) of pure maple syrup to add a little extra sweetness to both the pie filling and the whipped cream. So good!
2001416839,511606,2017/3/4,1,"An absolutely horrible flop! Disgusting looking and a pie plate of goo. I am an experienced cook and baker. I have made many, many cream pies, this was just en epic fail. I will make it again, in a few weeks. But this time, it is a grayish, brownish color, would not set, just a jiggly goo in the crust, tasted a wee bit of flour, very little banana flavor."
160280,498489,2013/9/28,1,"I made this tonight for supper. My family loves chowder, and loves seafood. I couldn&#039;t eat it. Everyone else ate a small portion. No one wants it again. I followed the recipe exactly - using Cod, Scallops and Lobster. It was just bits of seafood in a huge amount of thin milk. I added salt after tasting hoping it would get better but after adding a couple of teaspoons it still was just a fishy tasting bowl of milk. I then tried thickening it with some flour but finally decided it was a waste to add any more ingredients. There was just no making it better. I have seen this recipe on other websites with great reviews but I honestly can&#039;t imagine what the appeal could be.  I&#039;m not usually negative but seafood isn&#039;t cheap and this was a huge disappointment."
2858443,499298,2013/6/10,5,"This is a great recipe!  It was moist, delicious, and had a nice texture. I doubled the amount of cinnamon, since we like a lot of spice."
107135,503295,2013/7/18,5,wowser this was good .toss fast with the lime mixtureso popcorn not soggy. lime and parm go REALLY well together .zwt9
174096,503295,2013/8/31,5,Wonderful popcorn - so flavorful!  The tang from the lime juice and the heat from the Cajun seasoning were a great combo.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9
226867,503295,2013/9/2,4,I wish there was a way to get the lime juice more evenly dispersed - the pieces that absorbed the lime juice were the best! ZWT9 Soup-a-Stare
2000985833,503295,2016/4/24,4,"Great recipe, but, don&#039;t be afraid to double or triple the recipe. Secret is to pour some, stir popcorn, pour some stir popcorn, continue till gone. This way you can spread that delicious flavor more evenly."
266635,507506,2014/9/15,5,"This is a delicious and  hearty lentil soup -- loved the addition of the vermicelli and of course, the spinach.  Definitely a keeper. I served this with a chickpea, tomato, cucumber and feta salad. Next time I might add a bit more cumin to the soup and possibly a little heat (just my preference). Will definitely make this soup again. : )"
386585,507506,2015/1/21,5,"This was a really unique take on lentil soup which we thoroughly enjoyed.  I made this exactly as posted, using a combination of red and green lentils.  I am not a cumin fan, and was afraid it would be overpowering, but it wasn&#039;t.  This was very hearty and filling."
1271506,507506,2015/1/28,5,"This was delicious -- perfect soup for a snowy day here in &quot;Downeast&quot; Maine!  As one reviewer suggested, I added a little extra cumin as well as 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne to give it a bit of heat.  The technique of sauteing the spinach until almost brown and then adding it at the end was really different and definitely added to the flavor.  I will definitely be making this again."
318262,507506,2015/2/5,5,Loved the noodles in this and good seasoning for a unique taste. I had to add some water at the end as it had all boiled away. Served with naan and veggies on the side.
1762637,512283,2014/1/31,5,Delicious and refreshing
204024,507387,2014/5/5,5,"We really enjoyed this salad.  When tasting the dressing I felt that it was way too sweet, but when we put it all together it really fit in with the ingredients.   Made for Spring PAC 2014."
2767670,496609,2013/4/3,0,Sound good and very easy to prepare.
37449,503628,2013/7/17,4,A nice basic potato salad. I scaled down the recipe for 2 and added some chopped parsley. Thanks!

2000457779,501005,2017/8/1,3,"Needs more kimchi, kimchi juice (oh, and a reference to adding the kimchi). I would also add some korean pepper powder if you have for a true bite. We all liked the initial first few bites but then the combination of creamy and mushy became unpleasant."
296809,527457,2016/7/15,5,"Made exactly as written for Culinary Quest #3 (Philippines Region) - This is great, Stacy, &amp; such an easy fix that I managed in minutes. I had mangoes that were perfectly ripe &amp; ready for your recipe. It did seem very thin as I did the assembly, but chilling in the fridge for 6 1/2 hrs took care of that. It thickened nicely, was well-flavored &amp; enjoyed by both Siggi &amp; myself. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us &amp; the Quest. You got us off to an excellent start. :-)."
50509,510980,2013/12/29,4,"A lovely soup. I could not find any rosemary (I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll find it tomorrow!), so used fresh dill, adding some to the meatballs and the rest at the end of cooking. I made half the meatballs and just 1 quart of the soup - this was two servings for us. The lemon added a bright touch to both."
2002061683,528172,2018/3/19,0,OMG !!!!!!! The best fish ever. We went to Lazy Days today for lunch after hopping off of a charter out of Bud n Mary’s next door. We have been thinking of this fish offering forever. Googled and found the recipe. We’ll try it in a few wks and am sure it won’t be as perfect. We travel up and down The Keys and Lazy Days is the best for cooking our catch!! Gotta fish and visit Lazy Days. We ebyoyed your little store on the first floor. Great addition. So happy you’re up and running after Irma. See u next year! .

I googled lazy days style on a whim and was thrilled to see this. I was able to make the butter sauce 30 min in advance and had tomato, cheese and green onion (no scallion available) combined. Parsley ready on the side. Grilled the lobster, pan fried the fish, lazy day all the way! A little butter leftover will appear over chicken later this week."

1773360,508015,2014/7/9,5,This was absolutely wonderful as well as easy to prepare.  Will definitely make it again!!!
2001353474,502334,2017/1/15,1,I followed the directions as written. The rice wasn't even halfway cooked. Maybe it would work if you extended the rice's cooking time to about 50 minutes before adding the scallops. Looks like it's frozen pizza for us tonight.
44729320,507315,2014/11/9,4,"Very good, I modified it by increasing batch, tiny bit of olive oil on the pan to prevent butter burning, half way through cooking sprinkled some fine sea salt. Two minutes before done I added slivered almonds and tossed. Before removing from the oven I scattered 6 or 7 semi-sweet chocolate chips and tossed until melted.  So I loved the recipe and had fun adding my favs!"
2001285006,525973,2016/12/6,4,Haven't made it but sounds really good. Stopped at the Worcestshire sauce. That has anchovies and not vegetarian .
2000744382,516617,2016/3/13,3,"What a lovely and novel preparation for chicken!

I was left craving more pepperoni and more mozzarella in the stuffing, which is no reflection on OP. I also will use a meat tenderizer to flatten the chicken breast after butterfly-ing, which again is no reflection on OP. Salt and pepper the meat to taste.

I created a little bit of a mess because I rushed through the breading stage; However, I was careful to follow OP&#039;s instructions to keep the skillet hot prior to frying the chicken. Excellent suggestion OP!

I baked mine for 25 minutes. My oven is one of the most cooperative I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of working with, so 20 minutes would have been fine, but that&#039;s just my kitchen. 

It&#039;s worth making at least once! Give it a go! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1925885,527825,2016/8/25,5,"Loved this easy and elegant dessert! Just one word, though - fresh - in terms of the eggs, since they're not cooked. I only made half a recipe. And, to make life easier, I used a new toy, my whipped cream maker from Pampered Chef. Wow - whipped cream in under a minute! The toasted macaroon crumbs were genius. Luckily I made more than called for, which was a good thing because I couldn't stop nibbling on them! The half recipe made more than two 6 oz servings, so I put the rest of the mousse in small individual tasting cups. So cute - and they would make a perfect dessert for company. Light and so flavorful, with those bits of macaroon crumb floating inside. Thanks for posting this keeper of a recipe! Made for Culinary Quest 2016. Team Pi Rho Maniacs."
2002060495,536845,2018/9/11,0,What is cauliflower rice ? Is it a califlower that has been chopped quite finely after cooking or before cooking ? Or is it rice mixed with chopped cauliflower ? What do you do with the olive oil ? Thank you . Monique V.
2002038311,536845,2018/10/22,0,What do you do with the olive oil?
2911683,507434,2013/11/28,0,"I heard that two cups of coffee during pregnancy is ideal. I am pregnant and I was really searching for some variety in coffee, I have tried only Nestle&#039;s Greek Frappe. Now this creamy pumpkin coffee is a variety. I made it with milkmaid instead of milk. Trust me, that was awesome!!!"
107583,507434,2014/5/9,5,"This was a great treat for my mid-morning coffee.  Tastes just like S******k&#039;s and a lot cheaper.  If we ever get some warmer weather around here, I am going to try it as a frappe.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
895132,507434,2014/5/14,5,"Just plain yummy :) I used soy milk, and it tasted sooo good! Will make it again! Thanks for sharing.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAV Spring 2014"
163112,493301,2013/1/16,5,"So simple & so divine.  Quick, too.  Good for last minute desserts or impulse snacks.  ;)  I cut up pitted dates & topped it with a huge pile of very lightly sweetened whipped cream.  I added some slivered almonds & went out on a limb by adding a sprinkling of cinnamon.  MmmmmMMMMMMM!!  Made for Exploring Oman 1/13.  :)"
47892,493301,2013/1/19,5,"I added a couple more ""layers"" to this dessert: a sprinkle of ground cardamom and a pinch of saffron. Lovely! I very lightly sweetened the heavy cream with honey. Made for Exploring Oman January 2013. Thank you!"
1680722,513732,2014/8/21,5,Great chicken with great sauce. I preapared this dish for Culinary Quest 2014 and I&#039;m glad I tried this out. I loved the sauce combination of tomatoes with coconut milk and I love the ginger addition very much. We enjoyed it with leftover rice and leftover pasta; the sauce was appreciated with both!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this amazing dish!
226863,513732,2014/8/22,5,"I love grilled chicken and this was no exception.  I served with sauteed chayote and roasted potatoes.  Delicious.  Not quite as good as my chicken with Alabama White Sauce, but still good!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Culinary Quest Summer 2014 at Yuku.com."
895132,513732,2014/8/23,5,"Yum! We loved this, and I followed the recipe exactly except that I grilled the chicken under the broiler. This went very well with recipe #456714. I&#039;ll make this again, the sauce is a total winner! Thanks for sharing :)"
1620171,501185,2013/6/21,5,"Really yummy, however would have halved the &#039;drizzle&#039; as I had to throw a lot out, and would have halved the Cornflake crumbs as there were far too many. I did have to bake an extra 10 minutes, but I&#039;ll put that down to the size of the breast. All in all, solid effort, very very nice and moist and the coating was lovely. It was also very easy to make. Made for Raiders of the Lost Pantry June 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rating is based on flavour, not qty."
169430,501185,2013/6/21,5,"This really pleased some guests, in fact they raved. I did use the red pepper flakes to help offset the sweetness from the honey. Using really big breasts (from Costco), I needed about another 15 mins cooking time which was no problem. The chicken was tender and very well flavored and my guests left with the ask for recipe."
2585084,501185,2013/6/21,5,"I loved the sweet, crispy crust on this chicken.  The coconut and ginger gave this chicken crunch and loads of flavor.  My family enjoyed very much."
107583,501185,2013/6/21,5,"We tend to shy away from chicken breast recipes, as the meat often turns out dry.  Not this one.  Delicious and stayed so juicy.  The flavors are incredible.  I used the optional red pepper flakes.  Used the extra drizzle over some pasta I served with the chicken.  We will be having this again!"
131126,501185,2013/6/22,5,I had a table of happy diners! The flavors are incredible &amp; the drizzle puts it over the top. I did use the red pepper flakes and real butter.  I also appreciated the detailed instructions.  Good instructions do make for a better instructions.  Good luck in the contest!
266635,501185,2014/1/18,5,This chicken is sooo incredibly good and DH absolutely loved it too.  The lime/honey drizzle really makes this dish and compliments the coconut/cornflake breading very well.  I served this alongside your recipe#205944 and a side salad.  This recipe will also be going into my Best of 2014 Cookbook and it will be made often.  Thanks for a great dinner! : )
227978,501185,2015/1/8,5,"Super Delicious, Baby Kato!  The honey/butter/lime drizzle added an element that everyone agreed was what made it so delicious.  I used the optional red pepper flakes (maybe 1/2 teaspoon), and I&#039;m glad I did.  It wasn&#039;t too hot for tender taste buds, yet it still added a nice kick for those who like that extra punch.  I loved it!"
482376,501185,2015/5/8,5,"Oh my goodness, this recipe is absolutely delicious! I&#039;m putting it into my Best of 2015 cookbook. The chicken was crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside. The flavor from the breading technique and ingredients was excellent! I loved the touch of coconut flavor and the hint of heat from the red pepper flakes. The sauce really complements the flavors in the chicken. I kept drizzing &quot;just a little bit more&quot; over my chicken as I ate! I used a combination of boneless/skinless chicken breasts and thighs - both worked well. I feel you could easily halve the sauce recipe - although, I put the leftovers in my fridge to use as a salad dressing this week! I also think you could halve the cornflake mixture and still be fine. Thank you!"
266635,495095,2013/9/5,5,"This dish was really delicious and so satisfying.  Loved the sweetness from the dates along with the savory spices.  Comes together very quickly and it makes a very filling entree.  Served this dish over couscous along with a side salad.  Made for NA/ME, September, 2013."
498271,503314,2013/7/21,5,"Absolutely delicious!  Easy to make; I was generous with the pepper which was perfect with the sweetness of the ricotta and the brightness of the lemon.  Really loved this - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
114027,503314,2013/9/4,5,Really liked the lemon and black pepper flavors in this. I&#039;ll be making this for the next pot luck I go to! Made for ZWT9 the Hot Pink Panthers.
266635,503314,2014/3/6,5,"Delish!  Loved all the flavors and I added extra pepper as well.  Can&#039;t wait to serve this for Company. : )  Made for Best of 2013 Cookbook tag, March, 2014."
296809,503314,2014/12/3,5,Made as written for the Sweet December event. This is a tasty &amp; easy-fix. I do think it can be served hot or cold. I added extra garlic &amp; chose a different presentation. I served it w/flatbread made for another game &amp; glazed ham (also made for the Sweet December event). I will prob serve it cold or reduce the amt of lemon juice next time as it tended to separate from the mixture when heated. Thx for sharing this delicious recipe w/us.
37636,503314,2014/12/29,5,"We love baked ricotta and this was no exception. The lemon especially highlighted the dip, especially when I serve it with hot peperoncini. Very simple and quick to make as well. Thanks for sharing. ~s"
2000646752,524415,2015/11/6,5,I have had this made by the recipe creator and it was awesome.  So happy to be able to now make it on my own!
2000646768,524415,2015/11/6,5,"This has turned Taco Tuesday into a delicious night. The kids gobble them up, one after another."
2000660100,524415,2015/11/9,5,"Seriously tho-- our family is Latina so we eat this sort of thing on the regular... But this is easy to throw in the slow cooker and go about your day, it&#039;s got crazy awesome flavor and I haven&#039;t met a person yet (children included) who doesn&#039;t love it. Try it!"
1584433,524415,2016/6/22,5,"This recipe is seriously delicious and couldn't be easier. I currently have a batch going in the crock! I read a different recipe that mentioned throwing the pieces in the oven on broil for a few minutes after cooking, to brown them up. I'm going to try that this time around. (It takes quite a long time to boil down liquid and then brown pieces in the skillet.) Either way, this recipe is a real winner. Thanks for posting. :)"
125853,519248,2014/11/5,5,I used a bumper crop of Serrano peppers and added sliced onions and carrots.  Wonderful- and easy!
2734642,495800,2013/3/13,5,Delicious and easy to make!
1706426,499451,2013/4/30,4,"I thought I would love this, I love lobster and crab bisque, but it didn&#039;t really work for me, too rich is the only way I can think of to describe it. It was a fun experiment, though, thanks Mikekey! Made for please make my recipe 2013"
2002050154,535288,2018/3/14,5,Thank you!! My grandson wanted a Black Panther birthday cake and this is perfect! And purple is his favorite color. Win! Win!
137302,493109,2013/4/6,4,"At first bite I didn&#039;t think I was going to appreciate the flavor of this since it is so different in taste from normal Mac &amp;  Cheese recipes.  I used the basil and it definitely gave the macaroni a different but nice flavor.  I didn&#039;t think it was as cheesy as most of the casseroles, but actually was good.  I think the milk diluted the cheese a bit but after eating more of it, I realized the cheese flavor was there, it was just more delicate as if it had been made with an alfredo sauce.  I&#039;m giving it 4 stars because I liked it afterall and am about to have a small second helping.  BTW, I baked it at 375  degrees for about 30 minutes instead of on top of the stove.  Made for PAC Spring 2013."
498271,493109,2013/4/6,4,"This is a very nice mac-n-cheese recipe, and you&#039;ve gotta love comfort food that you can put together quickly with ingredients that are always on hand!  So much better than a boxed mix and really not much more effort than that.  I topped mine with a little smoked paprika and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2013"
296809,503222,2013/7/23,4,"Made for ZWT-9 &amp; the Goddesses. I actually made this twice, the 1st time as written &amp; we found it rather bland w/no seasoning(s). On a 2nd effort, I added lemon pepper &amp; Old Bay Seasoning (I favor using OBS w/lobster &amp; shrimp dishes). We liked it much better the 2nd time. DH preferred his plain, but I added a generous amt of grated smoked Gouda. Yum! We&#039;re so lucky that lobster is reasonable here vs the cost in the US. This was served w/toasted homemade bread, bagels &amp; fruit. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
169430,499446,2013/5/10,5,"An absolute delight. I coulden&#039;t find any chocolate no sugar added ice cream so I just had to break down and make my own, lol. I had beautiful dark Belgian chocolate ice cream with my favorite Van Houtte Mexican coffee and DH&#039;s stashed rum for the ingredients. It was marvelous on this beautiful sun filled afternoon. I&#039;ll be making this again and next time I&#039;ll get a photo (I can&#039;t even see my table top currently). So good!!"
2597942,515843,2014/5/13,5,"Oh my... this was so much fun! I had never thought of &quot;sprouting&quot; rice before. In the photos above, I took daily pics of the rice at various stages. First was the initial placing (in the Ball jar), then the 12 hour rinse (in the strainer), and then last, but not least... the final outcome!!! I did rinse and re-soak (3 times per day after the initial first 12 hours), and it took approx. 2 full days for them to reach full &quot;sprout-age&quot;. Maybe I should have stopped them when they had just little nubs (1 1/2 days)... but we shall see. Thanks for the fun time, Sharon. (Made for PRMR) P.S. I&#039;m planning to dry the rice out for a few days (as suggested), and then use it to make my Recipe #503914... I feel healthier already. :)"
1745502,504585,2013/8/9,5,"A simple yummy salad that can double as a meal. I used a weird kind of Danish blue cheese that was smeary instead of crumbly. I would have liked crumbly more. Loved the lightly fried bread, not so greasy or dry as croutons can get."
2711815,495226,2013/2/25,0,Love this idea!
2001134959,508517,2016/8/20,5,"Wonderful recipe- we've been making this weekly x 3 months and have it dialed in perfectly to reduce the prep/wait time: Make multiple batches of dough and topings at once and freeze in individual portions. when you want pizza, pull outa ball of dough and container of toppings, the evening before, let thaw in fridge, in morning,drop the dough onto the oiled pan and turn over once to coat the dough with oil. Press out into a 6 x 10&quot; rectangle-- let sit all day in fridge, when you get home, stretch again and let rise a second time(45 min). Bake per directions.... if you don't want to heat up the house in the summer you can bake it on a grill--- 350-400 deg, 15 min-- keep a close eye-- will brown well on bottom but not top edges. We've even brought it to my folks house as a surprise---let it rise at home and called ahead to preheat the oven when we were 30 min away. Travels well!"
2001482437,531109,2017/4/11,5,"Not only are they super yummy, they actually work with boosting your milk supply! I was able to pump an extra ounce per session and that means a lot when your trying to provide the most for your baby!"
1072593,499767,2015/9/3,5,"For all the cleaning products I&#039;ve made from food.com, I figure I may as well be the poster girl for the Keep America Beautiful campaign.  The best yet!"
2001942442,508517,2018/1/20,5,"Wow! Time and yeast work their magic - super light, delicious crust. Had to add a little more flour to get the dough to come together, and the cheese underneath the sauce felt strange - result was great. This definitely will become a steady part of the pizza rotation. As this is very little dough for the bowl of a stand mixer, there are t wo alternatives: 1) Use the paddle attachment 2) Use ice water and mix in the food processor for about 90-120 seconds. Great recipe."
37636,504041,2015/1/25,5,"Occasionally I like to try recipes that are a little different from what I usually make to see how my old standbys hold up and this is one of  those. While this recipe has a few different ingredients which really change the flavor from what I am used to, this is still an excellent recipe. And it goes to show that just like gumbo, there are many ways to do things. Now I have two favorite recipes for dirty rice to choose from: this one and my other old favorite.  Choices are good! Thanks for sharing."
39835,504068,2014/1/25,4,"Very good and a different way to serve cod. We made as directed, except I forgot the green onions, served with rice and green peas and grapes. Thanks for sharing!"
2939825,494502,2013/8/11,4,"This interested me because it is rare to see coconut used with another fruit. My husband has given it 4 stars, I would have given 3. The flavour was a bit flat. Rather than using stevia, I used the same serving size of regular sugar which left it not sweet. And there was a too subtle hint of cinnamon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I filled the cases to the brim and sprinkled a cinnamon/sugar mixture on top which made a lovely crunchy topping. That is something I would highly recommend. And when I make them again, I&#039;ll be sure to add a touch more cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg and sugar."
2001489444,494502,2018/1/23,2,"Favor success, but a baking disaster! Though the combination of coconut and raspberries really works. The recipes wasn't a success. After 20 minutes the muffins weren't even close to down. 180C is 355 in Farenheit. Perhaps it was supposed to be something else. Had to but them back in for another 15 min. That didn't really work. Wouldn't use this recipe again but really did like that combination."
1907073,504068,2016/10/10,5,The sauce has a wonderful flavor and the fish is nice and light. The only change I made was adding some olive oil to the mix to give it a bit more body. Will definitely make again!
2001417616,504041,2017/3/5,5,"Very good. We didn't use the stock at the end to deglaze the pan, because our pan didn't need it. We doubled the recipe, but stuck close to it other than that. Kid and parent approved!"
219942,504041,2018/8/27,5,"When I saw the ingredients, I knew it had to be good, and authentic. You had my husband at &quot;chicken livers,&quot; he loves that kind of stuff. Truly, don't allow this ingredient to throw you off making this, you can't taste the liver, but somehow it adds to the &quot;dirtiness!&quot; This recipe is going into my keeper file, it is wonderful! I can't wait to make it for a crowd. SWT"
983832,492939,2014/7/20,5,"Coated a couple rib-eyes in brown sugar, grilled, drizzled reduction sauce over top. Delicious. Thank you."
2324285,498952,2013/5/12,5,"These burgers are really good!  However, I did not stuff these, and instead just put the feta on top of the patties.  I also topped these with some sliced black olives and tomatoes.  I loved the addition of sun-dried tomatoes to the ground chicken- I will double the amount next time."
539686,498952,2013/7/15,5,"Made for the ZWT #9 and it&#039;s a keeper! Delicious and moist, we will have these again. Thanks for posting."

542159,513756,2014/4/20,5,"Great lunch! Loved that there is no mayo in this and the texture (was worried when I started to mash that it would be too thick but it turned out to be perfect), another concern was that it would be too much curry for DH (sound just right for me but he is not big on spicy of any kind) but he said it was really good. Thanks for the post."
527607,513756,2014/5/29,5,"This was very good, I really enjoyed it, partner is still stuck on grilled cheeses for lunch lol."
128473,527646,2016/8/8,5,"Wow, what a lovely surprise this dish was. The papaya was wonderful prepared this way. All the natural sugar makes itself known in this tasty treat. It was lovely, great flavors and a really nice texture. It reminds me of squash prepared this way. Thank you for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy again. Made for gift shop CQ3 - Bahamas."
280271,501350,2013/8/1,4,This had some mixed reviews...some of the family thought it tasted like chili and others thought it tasted like taco&#039;s...but everyone thought it needed more cheese...the pie didn&#039;t really set up...I think next time I will use less milk...the corn tortillas ended up on the tough side after cooking them so I&#039;m thinking of using flour tortillas next time...I served this with some sour cream and tortilla chips...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
179133,500073,2013/10/15,4,"Very interesting dip. I followed the recipe except for halving it and replaced celery (yuck) with some chopped sweet pepper instead. Oh, and I also left out the salt (wasn&#039;t needed IMO). Used homemade dill pickles. Almost forgot, the food processor was having trouble with the thickness so I added a Tbsp of water to thin a little. Served with tortilla chips. Not sure I&#039;ll make this again but I&#039;m very happy to have tried something different with one of my favorite ingredients (beans!) Thanks for sharing :)"

1680722,510593,2013/12/30,5,This was really delicious! I prepared it for all of us 4 for breakfast and we enjoyed it with a fresh croissant.&lt;br/&gt;I used Asian coffee (&quot;robusta&quot;) quality and we topped it with beaten light cream instead of ice cream as it&#039;s now winter and we like warm beverages. The final topping was cinnamon!&lt;br/&gt;Mmmhh a great start in the morning!
37449,510593,2014/2/3,5,Yum! Thoroughly enjoyed! I served with whipped cream. Thanks!

673444,521407,2017/3/5,5,"My family absolutely loved this dish, especially the kids. I used canned crab claws which was a great change of pace from other recipes using imitation crab. Unfortunately I couldn't find any fish eggs, so left them out. I can see how they'd be great in adding a bit of saltiness and pop but it was delicious without it also. I used more rice than called for to fill my 9x13 casserole. I used kewpie mayonnaise and seasoned, Korean nori. I also broiled the dish for a few minutes at the end just to brown it up a touch. A winner! Thanks for posting."
610488,502766,2013/7/20,5,"This is a wonderful and filling side dish, in my case, that was served with Kielbasa and sauerkraut. I don&#039;t know if it would be filling enough by itself except as a light meal. Turned out great!! Used the following cajun seasoning mixture - paprika, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne powder, dried oregano and dried thyme."
446523,515604,2014/5/23,5,wow these are amazing cookies. Just getting use to my oven and they were a bit dark but so yummy and moreish.  Have eaten half of them already.
173579,506238,2013/10/3,5,We thought your marinade was really good.  Thanks for sharing.
560491,507217,2013/10/27,5,This was so easy to make and so tasty too!  Made a serving for 2 and it was more than enough for DH and I.  I didn&#039;t have frozen peas and carrots so I diced some carrots and steamed them for a few minutes to soften and then added so they wouldn&#039;t be too crunchy in the end.  Made for My Three Chefs.
2001128581,527693,2017/7/22,0,"Do you have a substitute for the za'atar spice mix? Or is it a package you buy, what is it? Would love to try this."
2001763638,530700,2017/10/23,0,Omg I love percy Jacksons books
546010,500868,2013/9/16,5,"I love beets in any way shape or form. This is a great way to eat &#039;em!  I made 2 minor blunders, totally forgot to add garlic and the balsamic vinegar. It was fantastic. Once I realized I forgot the balsamic, I drizzled some on before storing the leftovers. It was so YUMMY.  Served at room temperature. Also, the beets came precooked (Costco) so I roasted them for about 15 minutes, to heat them through with the salt seasonings and they were perfect. I love the idea of using the food processor to combine and mince the fresh herbs &amp; salt.  Thanks Gailanng!"
2000582693,530367,2018/1/22,5,Just made this.. it is amazing!!!
1072593,511312,2015/5/15,5,TOTALLY 5 Stars!  Nado for president!!!
386585,501891,2013/10/28,5,"I thought this would be good, I just didn&#039;t realize how good!  Super easy to make with tons of flavor.  The feta adds a nice creamy touch.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for My 3 Chefs - October 2013."
2001925638,530367,2018/2/4,5,"So good. I'm Whole30ing right now and this is such a satisfying treat. Sliced it cracker-thin so I can try making crispy toasts. It's amazing right out of the oven, so warm and crunchy."
2001974504,530367,2018/2/4,5,"Love this recipe. It makes a great hostess gift with a nice cheese. Sometimes I make different combos and give 1/2 of two different loaves. One important note. THE BODY DOESN'T DIGEST WHOLE flax seed well, so I grind it (or you can buy it ground), and use the same 1 cup. It works just fine, I also make it without the oil."
2001970386,530367,2018/2/5,3,"It was good, but it needs something... more salt or maybe a cup of dried cranberries!"
133174,499287,2013/11/12,5,Made this pretty much as per recipe.  I boiled the sausages till firm and then cut them into inch chunks.  Added them back to the pan and cooked until cooked through.  They were very lean and I did need olive oil to cook the onions and garlic.  This was served other cooked quinoa with a salad and corn muffins for a nutrition packed meal.  Everyone thought the dish was wonderful.  Made for Aussie Swap.
83682,509249,2013/11/12,5,"This recipe appeared in a local paper over a year ago and I have kept a mix of it on&lt;br/&gt;hand ever since.  It is the best of the mug/microwave cakes.  I&#039;ve handed samples&lt;br/&gt;out to a lot of people and now they all use only this recipe.  I&#039;m so glad to see it&lt;br/&gt;posted, and I urge all to try it."
1925885,533124,2017/8/17,5,"Amazingly good! I just loved the sweet spice combo. I ground up the star anise by hand, and absolutely adore the taste of cardamom and mango, so what's not to love about this? I could eat this for dessert every day! Mine was a bit thick because I used Greek yogurt, but using regular yogurt would make it more drinkable. I used a spoon and didn't mind one bit... Going into my favorites file. Made for CQ4."
2000669519,516386,2015/11/12,5,"Super Yummy! Love this dish. I used cottage cheese instead of mayonnaise and thing it is so good, and healthier. :)"
1803339003,516386,2014/11/13,5,Excellent! I did change a couple things. I used a 2 lb. bag of frozen cauliflower and one small onion instead of chives which I pan roasted before adding to the other ingredients. I also used 1/2 cup greek yogurt instead of sour cream to increase the protein. This can definitely replace your potato cravings.
1803563594,516386,2014/12/26,5,"I selected this recipe as I have seen it doing the circuit on Facebook. I substituted Broccoli instead of Cauliflower, onion instead of chives and it was delicious."
1803594988,516386,2015/1/1,5,delicous!
1803657752,516386,2015/1/13,5,"5 stars for a great idea but the recipe needed tweaking.  I thinned the mixture with a splash of half &amp; half, added salt and pepper, and topped it with crushed Ritz crackers mixed with melted butter and parsley.  NOW it&#039;s delicious."
2000056327,516386,2015/3/11,5,"Love this, but I tweaked it by using real bacon Bacos, chopped green onions, and plain FF greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and a light sprinkle of Panco bread crumbs on top. Delicious!"
592268,516386,2015/5/3,5,"This was sooo good! Next time I will probably use light sour cream or yogurt and light mayo, to see if I can make it even more healthier. It&#039;s a keeper though!"
2000341403,516386,2015/7/15,5,Really good for those who are on a low carb diet
135870,516386,2015/11/16,5,This is so good. I took it to a church potluck and several people asked for the recipe. Even my husband who hates cauliflower will eat it this way. The only thing I left out was the mushrooms because I didn&#039;t have any and my husband will not eat anything with mushrooms in it. I imagine it would be good with the mushrooms and I may add them one day.
2000310297,516386,2016/3/11,5,"Easy and addicting. Such an adaptable recipe - I used what I had on hand -1/2 stick cream cheese with sour cream and Greek yogurt, cheddar and Gouda - delicious!!"
2000977516,516386,2016/4/18,5,Amazing!  I did half colby jack and half pepperjack cheeses.
2001137765,516386,2016/8/22,5,"5 stars for a great BASE recipe! I generally don't tweak a recipe the first time I use it, but for some reason, it bothered me there were no seasonings (except chives) (not even salt and pepper) going into this one. I think it would've turned out fine if I would've just followed the directions exactly, but I couldn't just leave it. Here are my alterations and it turned out FANTASTICALLY delicious that even my 6-year-old was happy to chow down on! 1. Although, they're optional in the recipe, I did not use mushrooms because I am allergic to them, so that's gonna be omitted anyway with whatever I cook. 2. I used green onions instead of chives. I probably put 4 tablespoons of green onions in the mixture and about the same on top at the end of the cooking process. 3. I splashed in a little bit of milk (whole milk) to thin it out a bit because it seemed very thick. Not so much where it was liquidy, but just a little thinner than it originally was. 4. I added garlic salt and black pepper to taste. I think next time I'll do crushed red pepper and/or Cajun seasoning though because that seems like it will be even better! 5. I melted butter in my dish (just cut about 4 or 5 tablespoons of butter and popped the dish in the oven while it preheated to melt the butter) just to make sure it didn't have a sticky horrible clean up afterwards (I hate scrubbing dishes and butter makes everything better, IMHO!). Plus it added a little extra flavor and was absolutely DIVINE! 6. I had a whole head of cabbage, turned it white side down in a pot and filled pot with water until the cabbage was mostly covered (all but the green stalk part) and boiled it for about 8 minutes. I poured it into a strainer to drain and cool. Once it was cooled enough for me to touch it without burning the hell out of my hands, I removed the green part and just cut the cauliflower up quickly. It was so much faster to cut it that way than to cut it raw and then cook it on the stove. It definitely needs to be at least mostly cooked before it goes into the oven! It turned out so nicely cooked and not mushy or too hard! I already wrote basically this review, but I don't think it actually posted, so here it is again. I hope I remembered all the alterations I did and got them all down for you! Great base recipe at least, but absolutely a keeper in my family nonetheless!"
2000902244,516386,2017/1/29,0,Omg it was fantastic. I used pepper bacon and grated don sweet onion as I did not have chives. I also used pepper jack cheese with Mexican blend on the top I will make this many times. Thank you.
2001417228,516386,2017/3/4,0,I made this and added into it some left over roast chicken which I just shredded. Made it into the main meal and not just a side dish. This is awesome.
1802582540,516386,2017/6/28,5,"Loved it for our low carb lifestyle. Added garlic, onion, salt and pepper. Ty for sharing."
2001624298,516386,2017/7/13,4,Just got done making it. I forgot the mushrooms but made it without them. It was good without them. My oldest son said it's a interesting mix of flavors. He always says that when I cook a new dish lol.
2001711783,516386,2017/9/12,0,This will save the recipe for me because I would like to try it tomorrow night
2000153955,516386,2018/9/3,5,My family loves this recipe. I have not added the mushrooms. I mix bacon throughout and on top. My brother asks me to make it for him. I may try to do this as a casserole with leftover meat or my browning a ground meat. Any cheese on had will work as well. Hope everyone will enjoy this recipe as well.
2002113405,531150,2018/9/13,0,I don't see where you used the mustard??
266635,498600,2013/7/12,5,"This is really delicious chicken and we loved the combination of the lime, cilantro and of course, the garlic and butter.  I baked these breasts in the oven vs. the grill and they turned out really well.  Will definitely keep this recipe on my &quot;short list&quot; as it was really tasty. Will try the grill next time. Made for the Went To Market tag, July, 2013."
65502,502772,2013/8/1,5,"I only used half the jerk seasoning and this was plenty hot enough for us! Lots of flavour and a nice kick, this was enjoyed by all of us. I doubled the recipe for 4 of us and used some leftover spaghetti instead of fettucine. The one recommendation I would give is to add some red pepper or something else for some colour as it is all beige. Made for my fellow Tasty Tester. Thanks ElizabethKnicely! :)"
2002196331,520864,2018/6/24,1,Really thought this would turn out good but the finished product turned out to not be crispy.
2002251035,520864,2018/8/18,5,My chicken tenders was crispy juicy and tender
2001949873,520864,2018/8/24,5,"Try this chicken between two raspberry bismarcks, dusted with powdered sugar. That's it, nothing else. Saw it on the Food Network on a carnival foods special. It is to die for."
2001411311,513992,2017/2/28,0,"I love Spam, I mean I'd eat it every single day if I could. I cannot because of the preservatives used in it. Specifically Sodium Nitrite. Your *NOTE says your recipe does not contain preservatives. Unfortunately for me, that is incorrect. The ingredients for Morton's Quick Salt per their own website are as follows: Morton Tender Quick mix contains salt, the main preserving agent; sugar, both sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite, curing agents that also contribute to development of color and flavor; and propylene glycol to keep the mixture uniform. Morton Tender Quick is NOT a meat tenderizer."
50509,510475,2014/1/4,4,"This made a very quick dinner, especially as I had prepared the meatballs in the morning. I made half the meatballs, but the full quantity of the sauce - Mr Grumpy likes really saucy dishes, and the sauce was good not only with the meatballs and rice, but also with the Brussels sprouts I had steamed. I did add more cayenne, just to add a bit more spice"
573325,494427,2013/2/2,5,"Mmmm, yummy! This is sooo thick, creamy and tasty! I love the combination of cocoa and cinnamon. Since it is still winter and I was in the mood for some warm spices, I added a tad of cloves, ginger and nutmeg, which I liked a lot. I only had soy milk on hand and used cane sugar instead of maple syrup. It worked out great and I cannot wait to make this again. What a healthy and tasty treat! Thank you so much for sharing, WICC!<br/>Made and reviewed during Veggie Swap #55 February 2013."
542159,494427,2013/2/18,5,Very satisfying! I made using dark cocoa powder which combined with the cinnamon and chia for a wonderful Latin flavored pudding. Also loved how healthy this was. Thanks so very much for the post.
593927,494427,2013/4/29,4,"Our turned out thinner with quite a cinnimony flavour which I don&#039;t mind but was more pronounced than chocolate but that may be due to using organic cacao powder instead of cocoa powder! I made home-made almond milk so I did end up adding more chia seeds as home-made is a thinner liquid. It still was too thin though. I used organic, raw, local honey to taste instead of maple syrup as that is what I keep on hand, my cinnamon is cassia bark as is most cinnamon in North America. Made for Veggie Swap # 57 ~ April 2013"
895132,494427,2013/10/9,4,"Very yummy! It was a bit too liquid with two tablespoons chia seeds, so I added another half tablespoon. And the cinnamon taste was a bit strong for me so next time I&#039;ll reduce it a bit and maybe add some real vanilla. I&#039;ll definitely make this again and play around with it! Thanks for posting :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for My Diabetic Recipes / Diabetes Forum"
347873,494427,2015/2/26,5,"I was very happy with the ease and good taste of this recipe.  I did add a lot more cocoa and I may tweak it some more, but it&#039;s great.  Thanks for posting!"
560491,502313,2013/10/22,4,"This was an interesting recipe, but really tasty.  Not sure that i liked the BBQ sauce on the pasta; it would have been really good smothering the chicken and then topped with cheese.  I used grape tomatoes that I cut in half so DH could easily pick them out and I used whole grain mustard instead of the spicy brown since that is what I found in the fridge.  Made for My Three Chefs."
386585,506144,2013/10/28,4,"This made for a hearty dinner, and was fairly quick and easy to put together.  While the description refers to beef, the use of sausage meat in the recipe is a nice twist on a typical Bolognese sauce.  I found that w hen I added the mushrooms and tomato paste, the pan was too dry, so I added about 1/2 cup of dry red wine to deglaze and give some moisture.  The directions didn&#039;t indicate when to add the sausage back in to the pan, so I added them with the diced tomatoes (which I assumed was one 15-oz. can).  Instead of stirring in my pasta, I tossed them together in a serving bowl.  I had some nice homemade fettucine that my 89-year-old (!) aunt made for me, and this sauce went perfectly with it.  I think this recipe would also work well with beef, if that&#039;s your preference.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
369715,507824,2013/10/24,4,I followed the recipe other then I only used one can of refried beans. I also used beef broth instead of chicken. I don&#039;t like chili spicy but I had to add three tablespoons of chili powder to get this to the heat I like. We all enjoyed this.
350921,500875,2013/7/25,4,"The grated cauliflower looks like rice, and if you spice it up with chili oil, you can believe it is."
192799,500875,2014/3/24,5,"Very easy and very good recipe!  I added some ginger, sesame oil, and only used 2T of soy sauce.  Also added some chicken for protein and it was really good. You could easily add any of your favorite vegetables to this and it would be just as tasty.  Thanks for sharing!"
666224,500875,2015/1/16,5,"Thank you for this recipe. It was very, very good. I will be making this often."
1926335,500875,2015/1/22,5,"I added chicken and fresh ginger, very tasty and I will be making this again."
242766,503193,2013/8/8,5,"We enjoyed these quick and easy Swedish meatballs.  I liked the fact that I usually have all these ingredients on hand, so I can make them whenever I need a quick meal.  I got 27 meatballs and they fit perfectly in my 9&quot; x 13&quot; baking dish.  Next time, I would reduce the salt in both the meatballs and the sauce as it was a little too salty for our tastes.  I served these over egg noodles.  Thank you for sharing the wonderful recipe.  Made for ZWT 9 Scandinavia for The Apron String Travelers."
171790,503193,2013/8/11,5,Wonderful meat balls. These were enjoyed by all tonight. I used 2 lbs of meat as I had guests for dinner and wanted to be sure to have enough. Now there&#039;ll be a bit left over for dh&#039;s dinner tomorrow night. Made for ZWT9 Soup A Stars.
328048,503193,2013/8/30,5,"Mmm... this was lovely. Although it wasn&#039;t my all time favorite swedish meatball recipe, it was definitely up there. Easy to make and very yummy. However, next time I might use onion powder or dehydrated onion instead of mincing the onion myself; I can never get it small enough to fold into the meatballs properly. We ate it with brown rice and it was just right."
286566,503193,2013/10/22,5,"I have only once had Swedish Meatballs and that was at Ikea and to be honest did not like them but these we absolutely loved and I especially liked that they were cooked in the oven.  I used very lean mince only but next time will double the sauce (I had scaled the recipe back for 3 serves) as I would have liked more sauce for the pasta that we served with the meatball.  Thank you ElizabethKnicely, made for Everyday A Holiday tag game."
157167,505750,2013/8/21,5,"Light and refreshing! I served this over Greek yogurt, and let the dates sit in the juice as well since they looked dry - I really like how the dates soaked in the flavor and softened.  For ZWT9"
480195,505750,2013/8/24,5,What a wonderful combination of flavors! We enjoyed this as a light dessert. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
482376,503193,2014/2/16,5,"Yummy! Great meatballs. I used abour 1 1/2 pcs of whole wheat bread and processed them to make the bread crumbs. It was a bit more thatn 3/4 C, but it still worked out great. The flavor of the meatballs was wonderful. The sauce turned out very nice, although not like the gravy I&#039;m used to for Swedish meatballs.  I used about half the amount of salt. Thank you for a yummy take of meatballs!"
616177,503193,2015/1/31,5,"OK, sometimes I think grrr, how can you rate a recipe when you changed it so much? I used this recipe for just the meatballs, as I have my own sauce. So I am rating the meatballs alone. They were great! I doubled this recipe so I could freeze some for another meal. Made 64 meatballs with my medium pampered chef cookie scoop.  I also used dried minced onion instead of mincing my own (just followed the instruction on bottle for how much dried = fresh). Did not double the salt &amp; pepper, as a previous commenter thought they were too salty. I also only had panko breadcrumbs on hand, so I used those. Thanks!"
161282,508504,2013/11/1,5,This is usually how we make our steaks--with the exception of using olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I agree--the McCormick steak seasoning is a MUST. It showcases wonderfully that the old adage that &quot;less is more&quot; should oftentimes be heeded within the culinary world as well. Absolutely delicious!!!!
226863,505144,2013/8/19,5,"Great salad!  I used avocado in the dressing instead of yogurt.  It turned out very thick, so I just sort of stirred it into each individual serving.  I thought the dressing would be too citrusy, but once it was mixed in with the rest of the ingredients, it was just a delight!  Great salad, and I&#039;ll enjoy it often.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game."
400708,499971,2014/4/16,5,"Made this bread to go with dinner tonight, and my friends it&#039;s AWESOME, the best garlic bread I&#039;ve ever made, so many different and awesome flavors going on here I should have doubled the recipe (but then a good thing I didn&#039;t as know I&#039;d have eaten it all) This is going right into my &quot;Best of 2014&#039; book.  It&#039;s a recipe that should go far on this site.  I made it as directed and will not ever change a thing.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
169430,499971,2014/4/18,5,"Certainly worth 5 stars. I made this to accompany Recipe #313463 this evening and what a great combo. It&#039;s simply delicious and something that will certainly be made again in my house. A Keeper all the way. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
194993,497743,2013/4/7,4,"I chose this recipe because I am committed to low carb and it&#039;s hard to find soup recipes. I love avocados, so this fit the bill. I liked that the recipe was well written and easy to follow, as well as the fact that it&#039;s a simple thing to put together. I used my own home-made chicken broth. I thought the finished product was good but not super. I felt it was missing something. I think I would use additional scallions and maybe a little garlic next time. Thanks for the recipe, Mariposa."
2001953432,533435,2018/1/25,0,WHERE'S THE RECIPE FOR THE FRITA SAUCE OR IS THAT THE CHEESE SAUCE ALSO?
772473,496772,2014/3/15,5,AMAZING cookies!  Thanks for posting :)
2001750886,496772,2017/10/14,5,Absolutely loved these!! They came out so soft and chewy and just enough hint of coffee. These cookies were gone in under 5 minutes. I posted the picture I think next time I will try all white chocolate chips ?? thank you so much for sharing this recipe
2001705494,533949,2017/11/22,0,Can you make this a day in advance and keep it in the fridge?
204024,499963,2013/5/18,5,Great mixture of flavors.  Fluffy and garlicy!!  Made for New kids on the Block.
128473,499963,2013/5/21,5,"What a lovely recipe, I made it two ways one exactly as written for me and one made without the garlic for my dh.  Both versions were well received.  The potatoes were light, fluffy and full of flavor.  The texture was excellent, thanks for sharing a recipe that i will make again.  Made for New Kids on the Block"
2000154139,499963,2015/7/19,4,I haven&#039;t tried this yet but it looks delish.  Only thing is I do not like skins left on my potatoes so I&#039;ll make it without.  Can&#039;t wait to try it.  Thanks!
2000021603,499963,2015/12/4,3,Red potatoes are in the WAXY category and usually considered a good choice for mashing.  STARCHY varieties like Russet make a fluffy mash.
2597942,503398,2013/8/19,4,OMG... I just wrote a review and it vanished. I will come back later to repost. Sorry!
2001566028,511523,2017/10/7,5,Made this today and it turned out perfect. The flavor was spot on and it was creamy and smooth. Followed the directions exactly. Must say I used lots of pots and utensils so clean up was busy. Happily DH jumped in and washed big stuff. We really liked it. I think the only tweak I would make is fewer breadcrumbs and longer bake time. Center was not hot enough. Thanks for a great recipe.
724631,512937,2014/2/12,5,"Great tasting supper soup, doesn&#039;t remind me of minestrone, but DH and I enjoyed it.  Update: my 20-mo.-old granddaughter gobbled this up and asked for a 2nd bowl!  Made in my 8-quart Cooks Essential pressure cooker, took me 20 minutes to come to pressure and I had to wait 10 minutes before doing &quot;quick release&quot; per my manual.  I&#039;m curious how this would compare to a cooktop p.c.  If you have a 6-qt p.c., pay strict attention to the amounts listed or else you will overload your p.c.  My tortellini came in a 12-oz package (I used all) and my spaghetti sauce came in a 32-oz. jar (I used all).  The finished product maxed out the capacity of my 8-qt. p.c.

1287956,510740,2014/2/27,5,"I made this even easier by using the pre-grilled chicken strips in the frozen section, and then instead of the soy sauce, I used a Hawaiian teriyaki sauce.  This was just a quick, delicious meal that is perfect for a busy weeknight."
80353,513738,2014/8/8,5,"This recipe has a delicious sauce that would also be good over chicken.  Can&#039;t access arbol chilies so I used an ordinary green bell pepper.  All good.  Good flavour and easy recipe, despite the many ingredients and steps."
2002019647,512937,2018/2/27,5,"My family thought this was a tasty meal. Simple ingredients, fast prep and cook times. Made recipe per instructions. I did use the 120z pkg of tortellini which made the soup pretty thick. Very good."
724631,497910,2013/4/26,5,"Wow!  I had Sriracha sauce which I had been afraid to open.  This recipe changed my mind.  I made half a batch, 1/4 cup, which fit my toaster oven broiler pan quite nicely.  I used it instead of Mrs. Dash Fiery Blend when I cooked freshly caught rockfish (striped bass).  Although I used a small amount (don&#039;t laugh, I cook my fish &quot;poached&quot; in butter: I spray my Corning casserole dish with Pam, then sprinkle a thin coating of Mrs. Dash Garlic &amp; Herb, then sprinkle a smattering of Mrs. Dash Fiery Blend only this time I used Sriracha Garlic Salt, lay in the rinsed and patted dry fish filet, then sprinkle a lesser amount of Mrs. Dash Garlic &amp; Herb and a lesser amount of Mrs. Dash Fiery Blend replaced by Sriracha Garlic Salt, and then I load on a thick layer of shaved butter or I Can&#039;t Believe It&#039;s Not Butter before covering and baking at 350 for 15 minutes.  Depending on the size of the filet, it may be done in 15 minutes or take 30+ minutes; the fish is done when the butter starts bubbling.)  Even with this small amount, we noticed the difference, and loved the sweet taste it gave the rockfish.  I plan to make up batches to give our fiery-spice-loving children who may not have tried Sriracha sauce on their own.  Can&#039;t wait to use this again!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2002217900,506308,2018/7/14,5,Omgosh you read my mind I added mini chocolate chips and made banana fudgesicles delish simple amazing
695933,508748,2013/11/3,5,"It&#039;s perfectly wonderful and we are delighted that I chose this recipe, a delicious treat this was on a cool night. I cheated a little and used canned whipped cream to top the coffee. We like to Thank you! PRMR 2013....Grpa"
381180,508748,2013/11/17,4,"Very chocolatey!  I tasted more chocolate than coffee, and will cut back on the chocolate next time.  I need to buy decaf so I can enjoy this at night!  I made this with all coconut cream and sweetened the coffee mixture with one teaspoon sugar/two cups of coffee.  Tagged for PRMR 2013."
169430,504505,2014/1/25,5,I made this using all broth and no wine or wine vinegar. It came out with very moist and tender chicken and lots of flavor. Recipe #262189 was used here. One serving was all I made and it was generous so there will be plenty to go around for a family. Thanks for sharing ellie.
422608,516847,2014/9/4,5,OMG! So yummy! I only used 1/2 but it was so yummy thank you for posting it!
1179225,516847,2014/9/6,4,This was a nice change. It really had a kick. Thanks for posting.
226867,516847,2016/1/18,5,What a nice change from regular popcorn! I didn&#039;t use as much siracha as specified - I am a wimp! Made this for your football win from a long time ago! Thanks
2000431901,516847,2016/7/18,5,This was AMAZING! I made it as written and our whole family loved it. We took it to a movie and my 18 month old went crazy for it eating it by the handful and refusing to let anyone else have the bag!
2002280862,535290,2018/9/21,0,What kind of sprinkles are the best to use if you have a geek in your family and want to make it just for them? I've looked around and couldn't find any sprinkles that were geeky enough. Thanks!
128473,508748,2014/2/16,5,"I love coffee and this fine one is no exception.  Love the flavor of the coffee, chocolate, cinnamon and cream, combined.  I felt really decadent and added whipped cream to the top drizzled with a little more cinnamon.  I was in heaven, for a short while.  Thanks so much for sharing Sharon.  Made for Best of 2013 Tag game."
169430,503148,2015/1/21,5,"Thank you BK for the new and great way to use couscous, I made a dry Harissa mix and used some in the couscous and a bit on the fish that it accompanied for last nights dinner, Simply delicious. Will certainly use this again."
2000737867,524968,2015/12/10,5,So yummy and simple. I love shrimp in pasta!
2000738584,524968,2015/12/10,5,Yummy!
2000738859,524968,2015/12/10,5,Sounds delicious!
2000739318,524968,2015/12/11,5,Amazingly simply and yet tasty and nutritious!
2000191486,513416,2015/5/8,4,DONT TELL PEOPLE TO SPLASH WATER ON HOT OIL YOU IDIOT! That how you burn your house down!
2001099863,513416,2016/7/23,5,"I followed the direction and added the water like instructed. I have to share with everyone what happened..... My house did NOT burn down nor did the vegetable oil splash up. It's pretty safe to say if you follow the simple instructions, you will be OK. Thank you for the recipe."
2001375501,513416,2017/2/2,4,"These are good and easy directions. I was looking for more detail between levels of heat and covering. So I will add that covering the potatoes in a skillet is a good idea, it also creates he condensation so that you don't have to put a splash of water on top of the oil just add the potatoes seaosned with oil in the skillet and listen for the sizzle. Cook to perfection. 25 min medium to low to high heat at the right times is about right. Thanks for sharing!"
45027729,534900,2018/2/18,3,"This looks delicious, but I wish the recipes on this site gave nutritional information."
2001733900,534900,2018/2/18,0,I think the recipe could be tweaked to make more meatballs than 3. That is a lot of food for 3 people. I would double or triple it.
2001934539,534900,2018/2/18,4,"This sure looks great, however as the other reviewer, I wish this recipe was tweaked for more than 3 people."
2001047423,534900,2018/2/19,5,"Gorgeous - and DIFFERENT!! This appealed to the 'inner child' &amp; would be great for children, made smaller if necessary. I even used spaghetti just like the picture showed &amp; a jarred Bolognese sauce, basically thickened tomato sauce with herbs (no 'pizza sauce' in the UK, we use tomato puree for pizzas). Add peas &amp; salad to 'finish' the meal, my children said it reminded them of their dinosaur/volcano set when they were small &amp; Jurassic Park was about. I will cook again, try veggy meat &amp; oil-free crumbs next."
2001969686,534900,2018/2/26,5,Our volcanos turned out just like the pictures and tasted awesome. They were much easier to make than I expected. My 4 year old grandson loves dinosaurs so his plate had 4 little visiting plastic creatures beside the volcano. We used ground turkey instead of chicken and since we don't all like onions they were left out. The recipe was confusing since it said to set aside 1 cup of bread crumbs for the volcano meat mixture but then later said to use 1/4 C. We used the 1/4 rather than a full cup and they were perfect!
2002022489,534900,2018/3/1,1,I have been cooking for over 40 years. This is quite possibly the worst written and prepared recipe I have ever read. The first thing that should be there is that FOUR hands are required for the wet/dry washing. There is NO mention of Pasta or sauce until THE END!!! Anything else from this website will be deleted due to the HORRIBLE prep of this recipe!!!
2001836683,534900,2018/3/4,0,"The nutritional value, is posted next to the word INGREDIENTS."
2001225395,534900,2018/4/9,5,"Although the recipe is a little confusing, it was delicious! I don't have kids, so just made this into regular shaped large meatballs. I have never used ground chicken for meatballs and was surprised at how good they were. Planning to make again and just make smaller meatballs."
58104,497981,2013/7/25,5,When I saw coconut oil in this I had to make. T&lt;br/&gt;Love the benefits and flavor of coconut.&lt;br/&gt;The eggs were nice and fluffy. I served with garlic chives and sliced purple tomatoes.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks
358517,497981,2014/3/5,5,Coconut oil is my new &#039;Go To&#039; oil in the kitchen.  These eggs were delicious!
128473,497981,2014/6/6,5,"I really enjoyed these quick and easy to make scrambled eggs.  The eggs were light and fluffy and tasted great.  I loved the addition of the coconut oil, it gave the eggs a nice flavor and kept them from being greasy.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will make again and again."
2000490943,497981,2016/2/27,5,"Wow; I would never think to cook eggs in coconut oil but I gave this a go and it is magical. They oil gave the eggs nice flavor, they were light/fluffy, and they were not greasy. I&#039;m going to cook eggs like this from now on. Delicious!"
280271,496779,2013/4/12,5,Hubby loved this!...He even said he likes it better then my normal recipe I use...the only changes I made was to use fresh crab...lucky me I found some on sale...and I threw in a few bay scallops...also on sale...what a yummy dish...I did find it took awhile to get use to the roasted red peppers...and I did use the optional sugar...thanks for posting this...=)
498271,496779,2014/3/7,5,"This is a delicious fish soup!  I was surprised by the addition of the red wine but it was really good, adding a nice deep flavor.  I used the optional shrimp (salad-sized) and skipped the crabmeat.  For the fish I used tilapia.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
198154,518749,2015/11/5,4,"While this isn&#039;t our favorite enchilada recipe, we did enjoy them.  Our enchilada sauce and rotel were both mild. If I make them again I may  add additional garlic  with some fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon.  We topped them with a Mexican blend shredded cheese and sour cream."
2001618490,520568,2017/7/8,1,"This is NOT a duros recipe. I'm not sure what it is. It puffed up and tasted like pretzels. Not mad at it, but it's not what I wanted at all. If I could give negative stars, I would. If you're wanting real duros, find a different recipe."
2002280182,530002,2018/9/21,5,Turned out like the picture!
2001081808,496779,2016/7/9,5,Easy &amp;a huge hit w my book group. I added snow crab in the shell for extra flavor (yep on sale) and lo sodium chicken broth to have enough liquid when we got talking and the mixture boiled down. Extra time on a low simmer didnt hurt anything and I cooked the l eftovers the next day w more wine and it was even better!
169430,505625,2014/3/21,5,"I awoke quite early this morning and decided that breakfast should be something special as I had plenty of time,lol. Anyway this just really hit my buttons and it made a great morning food. One serving (DH wasn&#039;t interested, no surprise). I mixed olive oil and fresh lemon juice and had to use everyday chili powder. It all came out to be a real treat, even using the dry veggie stock mix which I keep as backup. It&#039;s not a light dish and it&#039;s sugar heavy but it is delicious and a real pleasure. I had a mug of hot apricot tea to go with. My day is off to a great start. Made for: In The Lands of Figs and Apricots in the NA/ME forum."
47892,505625,2014/4/2,5,"I made this as written except for stirring in the fresh herbs *right* before serving. I subbed aleppo chili powder from Turkey and Israeli/pearl couscous in place of standard. Wonderful pairing with roasted chicken. This would also work with basmati rice, too! Made for &#039;Land of Figs and Apricots&#039; tag game. Yum!"
42748871,512273,2014/12/29,0,Thank you for posting the recipe! I had saved the recipe on my Pinterest board but the link pointed to the Publix site where they have removed the recipe. I plan on making the bake this weekend. My coworker made the recipe last year for Christmas and it was a huge hit!
2201427,518143,2014/8/25,5,Wow!!  Awesome recipe!!  So TASTY!!  5 stars for sure!
1802651220,518143,2014/8/25,5,Beautiful colors and must be tasty as well!
2200921,518143,2014/8/26,5,Looks delicious
1772643,518143,2014/8/26,5,Giddy Up that looks good!!
2677925,518143,2014/8/26,5,"Oooh, a tart.  Yummy!!! Sounds wonderful"
1558394,496182,2014/8/12,3,this pretty good  but for little kids cut out the spice and coconut milk powder  awesome for a cold winter or fall day:)
2209000,518143,2014/8/26,5,The colors alone make this tart look so delicious!
2198132,518143,2014/8/26,5,Great recipe and looks wonderful!
2200124,518143,2014/8/27,5,Will definitely need to try this recipe!  Tasty!
2667767,518143,2014/8/27,5,Looks really great!
2192609,518143,2014/8/29,5,What a great idea AND a great recipe!  Five Stars for sure!
2216338,518143,2014/8/29,5,You can serve me this tart anyday!  Major drooling going on.
306726,518143,2014/9/2,5,Love this recipe! I&#039;ll be trying it out this week!!!!!!
2189849,518143,2014/9/3,5,Great concept! So creative and packed with flavor!
498271,511196,2014/1/16,4,"What a healthy and tasty salad!  I used chopped dates instead of currants and did not use the optional kelp.  I liked it with and without the syrup, and I might try honey instead of the syrup next time.  I served this with rosemary wafer crackers for a light lunch - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
37449,494526,2013/2/26,5,"This was a nice cake that I enjoyed, then shared with a friend and he enjoyed too. Thanks! Made for PRMR game."
169430,503145,2014/1/9,5,"Delicious. Unfortunately, I had to use ground beef in place of lamb but the result was still a great dinner. I made 2 servings and got 12 meat balls so I guess I made them a bit bigger (oh well, :D). The tomato sauce was yummy as well. I really loved the couscous and that, my friend, will be showing up again with with almost anything and, quite possibly alone for a lunch. Made for Baby Kato&#039;s win in the Sweet December Event 2013."
226863,511998,2014/11/26,5,"I followed the recipe exactly, except I made half with mushrooms and half without to accommodate a non-mushroom eater.  So easy and quick to make!  Turned out delicious....for my half, I added some crushed red pepper flakes, and we sprinkled a bit of kosher salt over the entire thing, since our chicken had no salt added.  I would love to try this on Naan bread....think it would be spectacular with some added minced garlic cloves and some fresh spinach thrown on.  Wonderfully easy dinner to make and enjoy after working all day and then facing the grocery store the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.  Thanks for a life-saving recipe!!"
296809,504495,2013/8/21,5,"Made as written for the Goddesses of ZWT-9 because I wanted an easy-fix sandwich to accompany some leftover Asian soup for a &quot;Soup &amp; Sammie Nite&quot;. This tasty sammie turned out to be an excellent choice. I cut the chicken breasts into medallions, used the oven-method &amp; the chicken was tender &amp; flavorful. The sammie was juicy &amp; a bit messy to eat, but better that than dry &amp; tasteless as cardboard as some chicken sandwiches can be. For a fleeting moment I was tempted to lick the drips off the plate! Thx for sharing your recipe w/us."
1056712,497927,2014/10/3,5,"I made this recipe with chicken, and it was delicious. Used ground ginger. I&#039;m glad there&#039;s plenty of yummy sauce for the rice. Thank you!"
1803728952,497927,2015/6/17,0,"A 5* recipe ?

I made it and it was very good.
The ingredients were accurate but the directions are lacking information ;-(

So what happened to the garlic? When does that get added? Should the garlic be sliced or minced?
How long to simmer until the meat is cooked through?
Simple things, but such a a lazy presentation for such a tasty meal."
323186,515963,2014/5/26,5,"Easily prepared, a lovely version of one of my favourite dishes. Don&#039;t worry, you dont miss the cream!!!    Other than not having any kind of spiral pasta (thought I did :(),  I made this exactly as recipe, DELICIOUS!    Thank you, made and enjoyed for PRMR tag game"
2001420105,502785,2017/3/6,3,"My husband liked this and I didn't like it at all. I must admit that I don't like any baked or barbecue fish recipes except for fish curry. Fish always seems over cooked with these methods and too dry. But in my opinion the mixture of stuffing and the tomato sauce was not a good combination. I'd use the tomato mixture again though but cook up with saut&eacute;d fillets of fish and add a spiced up tomato mixture with garlic, more chilli and coriander."
2001320581,518268,2016/12/25,2,"After 12 hours, I was ready for this easy to make wonderment. Note that low cooking it even this long will yield you 4 servings, not 6, unless the roma tomatoes where you are at are the size of grapefruits. My first bite melted my tongue off, luckily I don't need that to type. 1 teaspoon of cayenne is way to much spice and dominates the dish."
2711800,496049,2013/2/25,5,Great recipe the only thing I changed was I substituted chicken stock for the wine. I served this over white rice. It's a keeper! Next time I will make the rouille.
296085,496049,2013/2/28,3,"Easy to prep and make - make like a ""stew dish"".<br/>Flavors were a bit bland and one note but filling none the less. <br/>Served it with white rice. <br/>I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and some baby carrots and celery as we like some veg. <br/>I skipped the rouille as I did not think it was necessary. <br/><br/>Thanks for posting."
13012576,496049,2013/10/22,0,You should call this chicken stew.. not bouillabaisse as it has seafood in it..not chicken.
226863,502939,2014/8/18,5,"I enjoyed this wonderful seasoning blend on some fresh tuna steaks.  I think this would be wonderful on chicken, beef, or any type of seafood.  Thanks for sharing!"
1803563469,514831,2014/12/26,5,Great recipe! I saw this in delicious magazine but it had disappeared when I went back to get the recipe. So thank you very much for putting it here. It turned out great and my vegetarians at Christmas loved it.
242766,503542,2018/8/23,4,"This dip is creamy and rich with a definite Cajun flavor. It's easy to make and goes together quickly. I should have left out the 1 teaspoon salt, as it was much too salty for our tastes. Unfortunately, the saltiness overpowered the delicious flavor for us. I used a combination of red and orange bell pepper, and I used the half-and-half. I served this with slices of baguette bread. **Made for Susie's World Tour 2018**"
2700833,495750,2013/2/19,0,I tried this recipe because I love Reubans.  It was delicious.  Very simple and easy to put together. This is a great new idea on how to bring a classic sandwich and put it into a casserole dish.  I will make again and again.
2700851,495750,2013/2/19,0,This looks like an excellent for some of my 'kraut-loving' friends. Daddy Lew
2701382,495750,2013/2/19,5,This looked like something different and turned out delish!

41632595,518365,2016/11/16,4,This is really good. I would not have thought to replace mayonnaise with yogurt and low-fat milk
1803727138,500439,2018/3/29,1,Do you active the yeast when you make the dough. You don't give enough direction.
865936,504125,2013/8/26,4,Just what a whole grain salad should be!  Plenty of delicious healthy vegetables and tastes great!
114882,504125,2017/1/13,5,"Delicious! Served to us in our monthly Diabetes Group meeting with a half sandwich (lettuce, spinach, tomato, turkey, and a little mayo) and a fruit portion. This salad was so flavorful that I wanted to keep eating more. Note 1: You can also use the sesame dressing they sell at COSTCO. Note 2: we made the quinoa in a rice cooker. I plan on making this for our next office party. MAHALO : )"
4439,496288,2013/3/9,5,"Thank you for posting this recipe. It was in my pile to post and you saved me the trouble. I have made this recipe twice, once with ground beef and once with ground turkey and it was great both times. Spicy, but not ridiculous, I like the fact that it uses lettuce instead of leeks, hard to find and more expensive. Easy to make and really good."
285039,496288,2014/1/14,5,"Smashingly delicious! I saw this on the Rachael Ray Show this past week as one of her top 10 most downloaded recipes of 2013 and thought I&#039;d try it, so thank you for posting it!  I used sesame oil, added pea pods, used a red pepper instead of a chili pepper, and used Chinese noodles. I will definitely make this again, and think I might add shaved carrot, bean sprouts, and maybe sauteed broccoli next time as well."
131126,510053,2014/5/19,5,This was tasty and had a good texture. The additions of corn and jalapenos added color and flavor.  Very pretty! Made for Pick A Chef 2014.
128473,507342,2014/5/8,4,"These were some tasty meatballs.  Served with simple Marinara Sauce for a lovely spagetti and meatballs dinner.  Whats not to love, beef, bacon and cheddar, my dh was in heaven.  The meatballs were a little dry but very tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
369715,499911,2013/5/21,4,I used two heads of broccoli as I didn&#039;t have any cauliflower but followed the rest of the recipe as written. It made for a nice salad on a hot and humid day.
41983082,499911,2014/3/6,5,"This salad is sooooo yummy!!! The dressing is a tad on the sweet side, but you could cut back the sugar. I substituted pepper bacon real bacon pieces (in the salad fixings aisle) for the bacon (no cook, no mess) and I used pre-shredded triple cheddar blend cheese. All I can say is WOW!! I will definitely be making this again!!!!"
2246854,499911,2014/5/18,5,Cut sugar to 1/3 cup. Threw in some grated parmeson. YUM
1802751806,499911,2014/5/19,5,"This is an awesome salad!! The bad news is it is NO WHERE near 15 minute prep time!! By the time I cooked 1/2 pound of bacon, washed cut and chopped both a head of cauliflower and broccoli, (and I used the Vidalia Onion chopper to do it!!), then broke apart the bacon, added the dressing, etc. it was about 1/2 hour to 45 minutes by the time I put it in the fridge.  It is worth it, but unrealistic to say it is 15 minutes from start to finish."
1802799772,499911,2014/6/5,5,"This is a great salad recipe. On the second batch, For a little flare I used cracked pepper olive oil mayonnaise. It gave it a nice kick and offset the sweetness. I also added sunflower seeds and golden raisins. A new favorite!"
623399,499911,2016/8/1,5,"AMAZING!!! I have seen this same recipe posted over and over on Facebook the last couple of years and kept forgetting to save it. I finally made this and I can tell I will be making it all the time. I only made half the recipe and only used broccoli since I didn't have cauliflower. It is great with only broccoli if you don't have the cauliflower. I did add in some chopped onion and a little parmesan cheese to the dressing. This was amazingly flavorful and so good to serve right away if you don't have time to refrigerate. After about 2 hours in the fridge is did slightly break down the broccoli but it was still very crunchy and creamy, which is the way I like it. Amazing, Amazingly good! Whomever was the original creator to this recipe, thank you for the super yummy recipe!"
1800324154,499911,2016/8/25,4,"I agree that the prep time is way more than 15 minutes for one worker. I have made this several times and have reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and increased the salt to 1 teaspoon, the cheese to 2 cups and added 1/4 cup grated parmesan. I chop the vegetables fairly finely and it makes about 3 quarts of salad."
2001240481,499911,2016/11/10,5,"Excellent, and very tasty. But...it takes a long time to make and frankly, I like quick and easy. This is delicious but it is not quick. The 15 minute prep time? I have no idea how that was done in 15 minutes. The chopping alone too me forever."
2001544729,499911,2017/5/19,0,"I have made this several times. Agree the prep time is way longer than they say. Also, Imreduce the mayo, sour cream and sugar by about half. Still flavorable but less runny and less fat. If serving to friends who don't eat bacon,, I replace the bacon with red onion or vadalia onion. Gives it a different flare."
2001564667,499911,2017/6/1,0,"I've made this for several years, and it's a favorite every time I make it. I add about 1/2 cup of red onion along with green pepper. A good addition."
2001652763,499911,2017/8/1,5,"I love this salad. Usually, when I buy broccoli and cauliflower, I clean, cut it up and place in ziploc bags for future use. I also use bacon bits, sunflower seeds, cranberries and parmesan for an extra kick."
2001032416,499911,2018/3/23,4,"I really don't see why it took people so long to make this. The 15 minute prep time is increased to MAYBE 20 minutes if you do it right. So here is what you do. Pre heat your oven to 400&deg;F, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, place your bacon on the pan and bake while you prep the rest of the ingredients. Flip it about 10 minutes through and continue baking as you prep the rest of the ingredients until the bacon is about as crisp as you want it to be. If you do this you are incorporating the bacon cook time into the vegetable and dressing prep time therefore making a more efficient use of your time. OR if you plan to make bacon on a day or so before you make this salad, just make extra and hide it from the family. That way you have some on hand. That all aside, I found this to be a tad on the sweet side. I think next time I make this I will decrease the sugar by a bit. I plan to experiment with other ingredients also. There are a lot of possibilities for this salad. I find it to be a great summer time side dish."
2002228460,499911,2018/7/24,5,"This is a great salad. I'm low carb/keto, so replaced sugar w/ a few drops of liquid stevia in the dressing and added some slivered almonds for crunch. Quite delicious."
440735,503303,2013/8/22,4,A quick and easy dish for a last minute dinner.  Some of the family liked the shrimp and some just the pork. I used a heavy hand with red pepper chili flakes instead of the pepper. I loved the sweet and spicy flavors of the dish.  Made for ZWT9 for the Gourmet Goddesses July 2013.
2001297534,500594,2018/4/10,5,I made this recipe as written except for cutting the servings in half. It was easy to make and had a lot of flavor. I think the next time I make this I might add some red pepper flake. Thanks for sharing.
165933,513358,2014/2/18,5,Made this recipe yesterday in the bread machine but finished it in the oven.  I did have to add a bit more water but that was the only change.  This bread came out quite dense but had fantastic flavor.  It smelled so good in the toaster this morning.  Thanks.
37449,508387,2014/1/30,4,I really enjoyed this sandwich. Next time I may freeze the tofu for a few hours to make it a little chewier texture. Loved the slaw! Thanks!
1742738,498653,2014/12/24,5,I made this with imitation lobster since my wife refuses to put real lobster in anything but  unclarified melted butter.  We both just loved it.  We are trying it out on other family members tomorrow as a side dish for Christmas dinner.
107135,503848,2013/7/25,5,sorry about pic wet and raining here easy cheap and tastes great zwt9
2667977,494429,2013/1/30,5,The mixture of the ranch with the hot pepper sauce give it a nice kick.
2667986,494429,2013/1/30,5,Delicious!!
2667997,494429,2013/1/30,5,This is an amazing recipe. I am drooling over it. Thank you Pamela for sharing your culinary expertise with the rest of the world.
2668051,494429,2013/1/30,5,"Delish, loved it!"
2668181,494429,2013/1/30,5,Yummy!
2668446,494429,2013/1/31,5,I could make this every day!
2667917,494429,2013/1/31,5,So easy and sooo good!
136997,494429,2013/2/3,5,"This is delicious. I had large shrimp on hand, which I diced into smaller pieces. Omitted the hot pepper sauce, as I don't care for heat. Made for New ids on the Block Tag game. :)"
2684581,494429,2013/2/9,5,I could eat this every day!
2684792,494429,2013/2/9,5,Soooo delicious!
169430,515507,2014/4/29,5,"I love it! Had everything in the house except for the Luzianne tea so I used Tetley Ceylon with President&#039;s Choice Raspberry Thriller. Made early in the afternoon and enjoyed it with dinner. I just made a half amount as I&#039;m the only iced tea drinker in the house. Oh yeah, used Splenda for the sugar. Made for PAC, Spring 2014."
2000684248,519289,2015/11/16,5,Very good!  My family loved it
695933,506225,2013/12/8,5,"Oh my. Hello turtle dove martini. OK, so I?m not usually one for cocktails mixed with cream, but this has got D/F over the moon! Yum! I don?t think I?m the only one frothing at the mouth with this heaven in a martini glass! I?d like to try this one without the cream too. D/F think it?d be equally as yummy! Cheers!  PRMR 2013....Grpa"
865936,506496,2014/4/21,4,"This made a yummy snack which I ate for lunch.  I like all the flavors, just not too sure about using so much mayo.  Perhaps I could sub in plain yogurt?  Anyway, I enjoyed the dish very well."
1803297945,512390,2014/11/3,5,"Added olives, canned parmesan cheese, green chile and cilantro. Yummy! The longer you chill, the better it is."
2324285,503559,2014/2/17,5,"So simple and so good!  I could only find dry split peas, so the peas took far less time to cook and came out looking like green mashed potatoes.  Ugly dish, but it was so delicious to make up for it.  Instead of carrots, I mixed in some chopped, fried BACON at the end.  Despite the simplicity, this is one of those rare vegetable side dishes that is capable of outshining a main course."
200862,504092,2013/10/14,4,"Oh, nice and easy!! The one star less than 5 is because I really wanted extra spices, so added cinnamon, cumin, fine coriander and fresh ginger. It was great, because my husband does not really like a strong curry. This was just fine. I admit I did not use chicken breasts (we really dislike them) and I used drumsticks and thighs with bone-in and skin-on -- so much more tasty! But never mind that, it was a lovely dish!! Thank you!"
2002039032,535830,2018/6/8,0,instant pudding mix? does it make a difference?
2001004813,535830,2018/6/8,0,Im thinking of soaking the wafers in coconut rum and/or coffee and chocolate liquer.
247530,535830,2018/6/9,0,I won't be making this NASTY sounding cake.

1546244,494435,2013/8/12,3,"Doesn&#039;t look like many of the people writing reviews for this recipe actually made the recipe which is not helpful: please only post a review of a recipe if you actually make the recipe. There is little value to 57 people saying &quot;This looks delicious!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I actually did make this recipe this past weekend and while it is good (can&#039;t miss with crab!) I would not make it again as written and have the following thoughts on it:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)	Ingredient overkill: this recipe is much more complicated than it needs to be. It could be twice as good with half the effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2)	Skip the cheese: it doesn&#039;t add enough to the flavor, or character, of the recipe to justify inclusion. The ranch dressing handles the flavor just fine without it. The cheese does add calories and cost, though, even though I subbed blue cheese for Gorgonzola.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3)	Don&#039;t use coleslaw mix: just buy a cabbage, cut up half of it, add carrots and a quarter or half of a Bermuda onion and make it yourself. Don?t ever buy bagged salad. It&#039;s just not natural! Did you hear about the recent Cyclospora outbreak tied to salad mix? Buy local, farm to table, whenever possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4)	Skip the grape tomatoes and, instead, just serve it with tomatoes. They do break up the color but it&#039;s a whole &#039;nother unnecessary step and nobody will miss them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5)	Skip the mayonnaise completely. The buttermilk/yoghurt combo provides plenty of body. I also recommend halving the volume of the dressing, as written it makes a ton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6)	The lemon is great with the crab flavor. Nice touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7)	Just add the whole pound of crabmeat into the slaw rather than divide it. This improves portability if it has to travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8)	Chives and parsley, why? I would stick with the standard purple of the Bermuda onion for the onion flavor. It looks better anyway. And skip the parsley. Do you usually put parsley in Cole Slaw? No. Then why add it here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9)	Top with fried garlic? It&#039;s not even mentioned in the ingredient list and again, what does it really add?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10)	The instructions are weak as written. They almost appear as an afterthought. They need more detail."
843817,494435,2015/5/29,5,Thank you Logansw for an wonderful recipe. It&#039;s refreshing and different. This will be made over and over again this summer.
542159,503930,2013/7/20,4,Knew this would make a nice breakfast but was very pleasantly surprised by how much flavor step one brought to these tomatoes. I almost skipped the first step thinking it would not make much difference but am very glad I did not. As the oven setting is missing z-mailed Elmotoo who states she uses 350 F. The only issue I had was that my egg was not even close to being done at 10 minutes it in realty took 20 minutes. Thanks for the post.
128473,503930,2014/5/21,4,"What a lovely breaky, this made.  I really enjoyed the egg prepared this way.  I also cooked it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. It was still raw after 10 minutes.  I really enjoyed the blast of flavor that the simple sauce added.  Thank you for sharing this tasty dish Elmotoo.  I will be enjoying this again and again.  Made for May Aussie Swap."
125853,513918,2014/3/23,5,Great New Mexico like flavor!  I was in a hurry and used 2 cans of white beans and cut down the cooking time.  Thought I was on a weekend trip to Taos!  This recipe is a definite keeper.
204024,497758,2013/4/7,5,"I usually think of pepper steak as a stir-fry dish; this version stews in a tomato broth with onions and bell peppers. We threw in some colorful mini sweet peppers for color, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. We got a filling, savory supper that everyone enjoyed over mashed potatoes.  The steak was soft and tender; if I do it again I&#039;ll add the onions and peppers later so that they keep more of their shape.  Overall, we loved it. Made for PAC Spring 2013."
653438,497758,2013/4/9,5,This was wonderful.  I fixed this in the crockpot and followed the instructions as written only I did add some fresh garlic and about half a can of diced tomatoes.  Served over mashed potatoes and all DH could do is go yummmm!  Thank you for posting.  Made for Spring PAC 2013.
1706426,497758,2013/4/27,4,"This was quite good, and super easy! The only reason I gave it only four was because of the ketchup. I felt it made it too sweet. I used chopped pepper and onions instead of sliced, I don&#039;t like large chunks, also, I did the crock-pot version, so the veggies virtually disintegrated, but it didn&#039;t matter, the flavor was there! Thanks, Rosie!"
39835,497758,2013/6/6,5,"Very good and easy recipe which we enjoyed. I made the crockpot version, but added chopped mini peppers at the end and served over noodles. I skipped the catsup but otherwise made as directed. Thanks for sharing!"
498271,497758,2014/1/6,4,Really easy and really tasty!  I made just as directed using the stovetop method.  The meat was tender and the sauce was nice and hearty.  Served over pasta and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!
227978,497758,2014/1/10,5,"A super great recipe, rosie316.  And it was indeed easy, as the title states.  I used the stove-top method and followed the recipe as written except I omitted the ketchup (no real reason other than I just didn&#039;t see the need, but I&#039;m glad I did after reading some of the other reviews who suggested ketchup seem to make it too sweet).  I served the pepper steak over rice, which the pan sauce was great for flavoring the plain white rice, too.  It was super good, and we really enjoyed it.  As easy as this is, I can imagine making this recipe quite often.  Made for your win in the 2013 Football Pool."
323186,500714,2013/7/17,5,"Made as written, mmm, this is Excellent,  Nancy!  I was horrified to find as I started prep, that I had no feta cheese!  Not knowing what to sub, I simply made it without ........   I will make this again with feta, but I&#039;ve got to say, it&#039;s really really good even without it!   super healthy too!    very glad I tried this recipe, made for PRMR tag game, thank you Nancy!"
1620171,500714,2013/7/20,5,"Very very yummy. I loved the toasted pine nuts. I omitted olives because I hate them, used greek basil because I could. Otherwise made as stated. Made for ZWT 9 for the Tasty Testers"
37449,500714,2013/8/29,5,I enjoyed this for lunch and dinner! I used whole wheat orzo and adjusted the recipe to my liking. I also scaled it down for 2. Made for ZWT 2013-Family Picks. Thanks!
452355,500714,2013/9/6,4,"DH and I liked that this recipe is really easy for a weeknight meal, with ingredients that we typically have on hand.  I used kalamata olives for the olives.  Given the ingredient list, and that we love all ingredients individually, I expected to love this dish, but instead just thought it was average.  It was fresh tasting, pretty on the plate, and easy to make, which I appreciated.  Made for ZWT9"
425105,500714,2015/2/22,5,"This is really a wonderful combination of flavors. I love how nothing overshadows anything else. You do need to add an amount for the olive oil. I&#039;m guessing you meant 1/4 tsp (I used more). I did steam the broccoli, and used the stems too after peeling away the tough outer skin."
226863,500714,2016/2/5,4,"This is easy to make, and I thought it would really wow me.  I think part of the fault is mine.  I think it would pair well with grilled chicken or fish, but my son wanted &quot;bang bang&quot; chicken, which is fried....just didn&#039;t go together!  I&#039;ll try this again with some shrimp or fish....think I&#039;d really enjoy the flavors more that way.  I wasn&#039;t sure of the amount of oil....and wasn&#039;t sure if I was supposed to stir that into the orzo or drain the pine nuts and red pepper flakes.  I drained, and think maybe I should have added it to the mix.....?"
280271,500714,2016/9/10,4,I omitted the olives because I don't care for them...I really enjoyed the flavors of this dish...but the hubby thought it was bland...I thought the feta really added to the over all taste...but I bet if I liked olives the tartness would have complemented the dish...made for &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; tag game...
542159,497758,2014/9/4,4,Very tender with a flavor close to one my mother used to make. This is a great recipe for less tender cuts of meat. Made using the stove top method and cut the water in half and still had more than enough sauce for us. Thanks for the post.
1058097,497758,2014/9/3,5,"This isn&#039;t what I normally think of as pepper steak, but it sure is good!  The meat was very tender.  I used the stovetop method and served it over pasta.  I also omitted the ketchup, after reading the other reviews.  Nice easy recipe, thanks for posting!"
266635,498752,2013/6/10,5,"This is a very nice &amp; spicy soup!  The only change I made was to serve the soup over rice.  I added some mexican cheese and cilantro.  DH wanted the eggs served on the side, but otherwise, I made a directed.  Made a really nice lunch.  Made for PRMR, June, 2013."
531065,533868,2017/10/11,5,Very good recipe .. I used southwestern seasoning on the chicken and it turned out great
1052873,498752,2013/9/16,4,"This was pretty good chili. I poached the eggs but in the end just couldn&#039;t stomach egg on my chili. The other people in my family who will eat fried eggs were ok with that but I just couldn&#039;t do it. I used 1/2 the spices because DH is wimpy and the chorizo was really hot. I cut up a couple of tortillas for the bottom, topped with Mexican blend shredded cheese and a dollop of Fage."
266635,511405,2018/5/6,4,We enjoyed this cornbread very much. I elected to use the diced green chilies vs. the serrano peppers. This recipe came together quickly and I baked it off in a cast-iron skillet. The honey-butter was a nice addition to this savory cornbread and the cilantro was also a nice addition as well; although I'm not sure that I was able to pick the flavor of the cilantro out in the overall flavor profile . Thanks for a really nice addition to our meal tonight.
37449,511982,2014/1/26,4,I enjoyed the Greek flavors with the fish. The feta cheese was a nice touch. Thanks!
2597942,513812,2014/5/3,4,"I made this dish pretty much as directed. But I did only have 2 cloves of minced garlic (I wish I had more)... and I skipped the cilantro (I&#039;m not a big fan of it), so I subbed some fresh parsley. I did use thighs, like specified, but I bet it would be equally as good if using breast meat. I love almost any dish with olives in it (just the thought of pimento stuffed olives makes my mouth water... literally!). I did need to add a tad bit more liquid (so I used about 2 tablespoons of chicken broth, rather than adding more water), as my rice was still not cooked thru and the liquid was gone from the pan. Over-all, this was a tasty recipe. I will tweak it until I get it exactly the way we like it. Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
724631,513812,2014/8/28,5,"This came out perfect for us, using a Goya Arroz Amarillo package.  I had an already opened jar of Queen olives stuffed with jalapenos, so I used that, and we loved that extra little zing.  This was so easy, except for deboning my chicken thighs.  I let it cook for 22 minutes. I served it with steamed broccoli.  This is comfort food, so we will enjoy this again.  Thank you, Nancy!  Made for Culinary Quest."
204024,513812,2014/9/25,5,"First, one little nit-pick: you will need to adjust the water to the rice. Instead of one cup of water, use the amount called for on the package, in our case, two cups. (We were warned by a previous reviewer.) Once over that hurdle, this all went together easily and it&#039;s a real flavor treat: beautiful to look at and an explosion of great flavors in the mouth. Filling like comfort food, but festive, too! Needless to say, we loved it!"
226867,513812,2015/3/4,5,This was mighty fine! I used chicken breast and it turned out great. (I&#039;m too lazy to debone thighs!) I may add some chopped onion and/or red pepper next time. Loved the olives! made for best of 2014
482376,513812,2015/3/13,5,"Yum, yum! I absolutely loved the rice with olives. In fact, I could eat just that part for my dinner and be perfectly happy. The chicken made my husband happy though. It was a great combination, full of flavor. All I needed to add was a salad, for a complete meal. Thank you!"
2001100233,513812,2016/7/24,5,Great when made as directed. You can submit orange extract for orange zest. Also cornbread makes a good side. Goya rice pack is a good one to use.
383346,507298,2013/10/7,5,I made this non alcoholic drink for my son and he liked it a lot.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for Rookie tag game
1287956,532963,2017/7/29,0,Adding this to my &quot;I want to make!&quot; pile. It sounds like a baklava with cheese.
2768858,498155,2013/4/3,0,"Orange, moist and tasty. Recipe handles adaptations (some butter with the oil, some whole wheat flour with the white) and additions (pecans, raisins, allspice, nutmeg) well."
2002054786,498155,2018/3/16,1,"I was quite disappointed with this recipe. Even my toddler had some complaints. It is bland, doughy, and not sweet enough."
222564,532963,2017/12/14,5,"Absolutely delicious feta phyllo pie with honey, sweet and savoury, crunchy, pie! Easy preparation, too."
2001894932,532963,2018/1/25,5,"Fell in love with this dish.paired it with a lentil salad. Sweet,salty and sour a dance in your mouth!"
2002207810,518215,2018/7/4,0,my husband and i are renewing our vows next year and i made these before and they are delicious. going to make these for our reception
2001894932,531179,2017/12/28,0,Well first the recipe directions says preheat to 375&deg; then I watched the video Brett says 350&deg; so ran in and turned it down . I had to use a 8&quot; round as that's what in have .I put a sheet pan underneath. I also used a standard 15oz can peaches drained (can never be enough fruit). At about 40 min mine was done the video says 50 not 55 as in directions just ck. I'm thinking that the 375&deg; was the cause of the lesser amount of time in my case. Looks perfect. Have idea why the photos upside down haha upside-down cake and photo
1680722,512720,2014/12/11,5,"We all loved this frittata as described in the recipe. I used light cream cheese and all worked perfectly together. &lt;br/&gt;This was a delicious satisfing dinner, we only added with some bread and little salami. &lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot, I was just looking for an idea for dinner as I saw your recipe. This was perfect for us!"
724631,510828,2014/4/23,5,"An instant favorite at our home!  DH can&#039;t stop talking about how much he loves this particular coffeecake.  Using a 13x9-inch pan, half the batter just barely covered the bottom of the pan, and I had to play with the top half for coverage.  The topping covered almost all of the coffeecake.  So next time, I might increase the batter and the topping mixture to make it easier on me.  (DH would be upset if I made a smaller coffeecake instead!)  Made for Spring Photo Tag."
1179225,510828,2014/4/26,4,Very good! I did have some trouble getting the batter to spread. I used toasted lightly salted pecans from Trader Joe&#039;s and I thought they really added.I&#039;m looking froward to trying this tomorrow morning with coffee. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
493738,510828,2016/9/25,5,"So good! This is in my husband's top 5 favorite things I've ever made. I've made this twice and modified the batter a bit the second time. Like another reviewer, I had difficulties spreading the batter due to thickness so I used 1/2 cup of milk the second time to make the batter more manageable."
1072593,501240,2015/9/14,5,"Fish sauce is soooo good, but smelly.  Over time I&#039;ve developed a wonderful and rare talent of blocking my nasal receptors without actually suffocating.  Ahhhh, if only the world would let me be in charge! Would make again."
220348,503264,2013/8/7,4,"I like that this recipe is different from all other mashed potato recipes. I did have a hard time finding potato flakes, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it turned out. I&#039;m not sure about the saurkraut, though."
2001081372,503264,2017/9/1,1,Would have been great if made with fresh potatoes .....the instant potatoes were awful. It would even be good if you used the store bought mashed potatoes in the refrigerated section.
128473,499996,2013/5/21,5,"I love homemade cantaloupe coolers.  The addition of the rosewater and lemon make this very special.  The flavor was outstanding, fresh, raw and sweet, just the way I like it.  It was very quick and easy to make. Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will enjoy often this summer.  made for New Kids on the Block Game"
47892,504523,2013/8/1,0,We all loved the flavors in this but I had problems with my potatoes&lt;br/&gt;almost turning to mashed potatoes and. I tried to undercook them slightly. &lt;br/&gt;I think next time I will pan fry the potatoes then do the sugar/butter mixture or&lt;br/&gt;something along those lines... Delicious potatoes! Served with leftover veggies over&lt;br/&gt;loose leaf lettuce and Recipe #373442. Made for ZWT 9.
2002047119,531150,2018/9/13,5,"Made this for my daughter and her family, my granddaughter is very picky, and they all loved it!"
2002305701,531150,2018/10/23,0,How thick do you cut the potatoes? It has a question mark in the recipe.
227978,504523,2013/11/13,5,What a great way to make plain ole potatoes shine in flavor.  The recipe appealed to me because I wanted to try steaming potatoes (which I don&#039;t usually cook my potatoes that way).  This method really softened up the potatoes nicely.  Made for the 2013 pammyowl Cook-A-Thon in Pam&#039;s memory.  And I will return to this recipe often.
28177,504523,2013/11/17,5,"We loved the flavor of these potatoes.  They tasted like our favorite baked sweet potatoes that have a brown sugar, butter and pecan topping.  My only change next time will be to steam the potatoes for about half the time I did last night.  I used my rice/veggie steamer and steamed the sliced potatoes for 35 minutes.  Next time I&#039;ll only steam them about 20 minutes.  I&#039;m hoping they will hold up to the caramelizing process if they are a little firmer to begin with.  I tried to let them brown a little more, but they were quickly becoming chunky mashed potatoes, which only mattered for photographic purposes, they tasted so awesome that no one cared what shape they came to the table in.  ;)  Thanks for sharing some great recipes for us to remember you by.  Made &amp; enjoyed for cookathon in Pammy&#039;s memory."
2001617585,504523,2017/7/8,0,"These aren't exactly traditional danish (Brunede Kartofler): they're usually not sliced, and are completely brown and glazed in appearence. Small round potatoes are usually used. Haven't tried this recipe, just wanted to let you know."
1906570,535319,2018/4/15,4,Didn’t have a slow cooker so I used a cast iron pot in a low oven. Very tasty but instead of water I used bone broth. I’ll make it again for sure.
1023526,535319,2018/5/28,5,We really enjoyed this. Thanks for posting it!
305531,494210,2014/4/26,5,This was a nice hearty scramble. I used bacon and cooked it for about 20 minutes. Next time I would only cook it for about 15 minutes because it was a little dry. Thanks for sharing this nice recipe. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
679953,502765,2015/1/24,5,"This was a truly blue cheese night here.   Made this and served on some triscuits, and as a snack after having recipe # 255473 for dinner .. a nice quick meal, and an appetizer after dinner.  Very flavorful, and made for a great poker snack tonight, with the guys.  Everyone enjoyed  Made for your football win."
865936,502765,2017/9/1,5,"This is a beautiful and fancy looking recipe, but still very easy. You might want to spread it on toast, but I put it on a grilled strip steak. Tomorrow it is destined to find a place on a baked potato. If there is any left, maybe I'll drag out some rye crisps."
2000980185,516267,2016/4/20,5,"My go to for amazing chicken soup in 25 mins. I omit the noodle soup part part. use organic chicken, reduce water by 2 parts and replace with good quality broth. Finish off by stirring in 1/3 cup butter. Heavenly!"
2000621352,510756,2015/12/18,0,"This is a great recipe  HOWEVER, the oven temp is too high; 300 is about right.  My first batch were way overbrowned, had to toss them, but I could tell this was going to be a terrific cookie.  I made two additional batches baked at 300 for 25 minutes and they came out just perfect."
1592049,495590,2013/3/18,5,"Great Recipe!!  Scottish Eggs are one of my Favorite..Love the Hash Browns, Sausage with the Eggs..Fantastic Flavors :-)"
2742440,495590,2013/3/18,0,This sounds perfect for our Sunday brunches!
2742770,495590,2013/3/18,5,Delicious! Took her suggestion and added red peppers-- clever brunch idea!
2742842,495590,2013/3/18,5,Was an amazing twist on sunday brunch. the kids just loved it!
400708,500039,2013/9/8,5,"I&#039;m so honored to be the first to review this great recipe.  I&#039;ve never even heard of Tim Horton&#039;s but if he serves these I will be looking for it.  They are so good, just the right amount of sweet with that great coffee glaze.  I made as directed up to the dough, but then neither  DH or myself needed to eat a dozen donutes so cut the dough into 4 sections, cooked one and froze the rest, I&#039;ll be eager to see how the frozen ones come out.  Dusted with dusting sugar and it not only looked pretty but tasted awesome.  I did take a photo but it came out blurry - so will take another one to post with the next batch"
2001933781,532074,2018/1/15,5,
1803787389,532074,2018/2/8,4,"Haven't tried this yet but it sounds good. However, I could not stop laughing at the typos in the first line of the directions. &quot;Pour rice brain oil into a stock pot and cook of onions, white part of the scallions, garlic and ginger for 5-7 minutes on medium-heat or until caramelized.&quot;"
2002112123,532074,2018/4/13,0,"Tried this tonight, it was amazing!! then i saw how many calories it had per serving... Definitely one for special occasions, way too many calories for a regular dinner lol, delicious all the same"
37449,511255,2014/1/1,5,What a great rich dish!  I used red onions as shallots are rather pricey here. I halved the recipe and have leftovers for tomorrow! Thanks for a great last recipe for 2013!
679953,501355,2013/6/21,5,"So easy, and so good,  made 3 one for me, and 2 for the kids.  I did make them chicken cordon bleu style as was one of the options with some leftover diced chicken, shredded swiss cheese, and some diced ham.  I did add an 1/8 teaspoon of pepper to these too.  Other than that what a unique way of making an omelette, but with great results.  The variations are endless.  Tagged enjoyed and made for PRMR Tag."
461834,501355,2013/6/23,5,"Awesome!!!  Directions were spot on!!!  I made one omelet for my lunch today and followed as written, adding these ingredients:  monterey jack/cheddar cheese combo, cooked/crumbled bacon, sauteed onion, red bell pepper and shredded hashbrowns.  Since the omelet only cooks for 10 minutes, felt it was better to pre-cook the veggies and that worked out great!!  I served mine with a blueberry muffin and some orange slices, delicious.  Thanks for sharing a fun and yummy recipe!!  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
212609,501355,2013/7/10,5,"What an absolutely fabulous and effective idea-I love it!!&lt;br/&gt;I used plenty of cheese, peppers, ham and onion with a few chilli flakes thrown in for good measure.&lt;br/&gt;A real lip smacker of a lunch,  thanks Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;Going to teach DH how to make these, as he loves omelets, and can&#039;t make them!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
2399085,501355,2013/9/1,5,"PRMR! Terrific, we loved it. I can&#039;t believe how easy it was too. Perfect for in the bind moments! Thanks"
628076,501355,2014/3/21,5,"Great fun dinner tonight. The kids loved it because they could choose what went in their omelet and we loved it because we could too. The kids had ham and cheese. The adults had onion, roasted red pepper and chicken with cheese as well. Thanks"
623915,501355,2015/6/2,5,"These are SOOO easy to make, they are all done at the same time and everyone gets exactly what they want... they are wonderful!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!"
329903,501355,2016/6/15,5,"have been making this recipe for months in australia with no problems,,,using Glad bag snap lock bags. As these no available in UK ordered box of ziplock touch freezer bag and the top immediately melted. Use stainless steel pot in both countries, however in australia use electric cooker while in UK use gas. any suggestions."
2001661565,501355,2017/8/7,0,This isn't a joke right? Nobody is really making an omelette in a bag and boiling it. It. Says on the Ziplock bag box do not microwave. Heating it up to 212 degrees is the same as microwaving it. It's not going to melt the bag but chemicals from the bag will leech into the food inside it.
2002076480,531146,2018/3/29,4,"First time in my life I ever purchased cilantro. I had to get the produce manager to show me what it looked like. This is a fairly easy dish to make, if you use a food processor to chop the onions and green bell pepper like I did. It's also VERY hearty, and the kids like it, too. After I put the first portion of the cornbread mix over the filling, I thought it looked too thing, so I quickly put together another batch. Yt wasn't necessary; made mine come out a BIT too much on the cornbread side of the dish, but still, quite palatable. The sour cream makes it blossom with taste. I think it would be good with some salsa, too."
2002092679,531146,2018/4/2,4,"This was really good. I made this last night and my wife loved it. I made a minor change by using Diced Tomatoes with Green chili's and added a little more cumin (1/2 tsp), but I cooked exactly like the recipe. Very easy and very good, especially with the Sour Cream and Tortilla chip on the side."
1680722,497960,2013/4/5,5,"How delicious was this is a really tasty, refreshing and light salad!&lt;br/&gt;We loved the combination with oranges and the rich addition of spices and herbs.&lt;br/&gt;Next time I would like to serve this BBQ.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this great recipe!"
2585084,497960,2013/4/23,5,"This is a crisp, zesty salad.  The cilantro and mint did a delightful dance with the citrus,cinnamon, and cumin.  I will prepare it again.  Thank you for sharing this salad recipe."
582561,497960,2014/5/3,5,Just simply perfect.  The cinnamon adds a tasty dimension to a simple salad.  I had run out of ground cumin so sub&#039;ed with a small tsp of whole cumin seeds.  Low calorie as well so ideal for anyone watching their weight.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap May 2014.
2000663689,520434,2015/11/19,0,"Loved it! Ok I made it but I changed it, so did I make it? I used Chicken Broth in place of Vegetable broth, because the store I chose didn&#039;t sell Vegetable broth. I made one batch with beans and one without ( I don&#039;t care for beans), but I was told they were both delicious! Thanks for the great recipe and other than the broth issue, I followed the recipe completely."
2000422915,515871,2015/8/23,5,I love it!!!!
1803108313,522935,2015/7/29,5,Best beans I have ever made! I followed it as is and it was perfect. It is perfectly simple and it tastes amazing!!! Will definitely make it again.
2722551,496100,2013/3/5,5,"It's like a page out of wonderful cookbook that I just bought. I have been using Paleo for a week straight now and so far, 5 pounds gone."
400708,502605,2014/7/5,5,"Made this for a flank steak to make fajitas and was awesome.  Just the right spice, we marinated for 24 hours and came out great."
126440,509109,2017/3/17,5,"Loved this easy salad. Didn't steam the sprouts, just shredded, dressed and chilled til serving."
2016203,507551,2013/10/15,5,Delicious!  I used Zatarains Dirty Rice Mix instead of the Black/Volcanic rice as I could not locate them in the rice aisle.  Thank you Sophia&#039;s Mom!
217376,507551,2014/12/1,5,"Works for me, great recipe, but the filling quantities are a little high for just two split acorn squashes, I should have made three. I added more garlic too, but that&#039;s because I&#039;m Puertorican. :)"
2000225933,527548,2017/7/31,5,THIS WAS SIMPLY DELICIOUS AND PERFECT FOR A DIETER WHO LOVES VEGETARIAN DISHES. IT WAS SURPRISINGLY QUITE FILLING. I COOKED THE LENTILS TWICE AS LONG AS THE RECIPE TO GET THEM SOFTER THAN AL DENTE. USING FRESH LEMON JUICE SEEMED TO REALLY BE WHAT PULLED THE DISH TOGETHER. WE ALL ENJOYED THIS SUNDAY NIGHT SALAD MEAL. A GLASS OF A OLD WORLD RICHLY TEXTURED PINOT GRIS OR GRIGIO WOULD MATCH HEAVENLY WELL.
2001407318,527548,2017/8/24,0,Haven't made this yet but loved the review by Lisa so much I will be giving it a try this week.
2001938163,527548,2018/3/7,0,I added a splash of honey to the dressing. This is absolutely delicious. Really one of the best things I have ever eaten.
2419920,514577,2014/3/20,5,Sounds delicious and easy!
2729621,514577,2014/3/23,5,Easy and delish! I didn&#039;t have a pizza wheel so I sliced with a small knif and sealed the edges with a fork like on a pie. It took a little longer but was worth the trouble!
1803654949,509271,2015/1/13,4,Loved it. Made my own tomato sauce - added a cup of re-hydrated TSP to up the protein and only used the shredded mozzarella on the top as a cup of Parmesan added to the ricotta is plenty cheesy and lots of calories.
498271,503216,2013/7/30,4,"This is a different and tasty way to serve watermelon!  The spices compliment the sweet watermelon and the lime juice is the perfect finishing touch.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
1052873,503216,2013/8/3,4,"This is not the spiced watermelon of my childhood, although I couldn&#039;t tell you what it was. More pumpkin pie flavored than taco flavored I think. It was an interesting snack and very different. Made for ZWT9."
305531,503216,2013/8/4,4,"An interesting twist to watermelon. The lime juice was very freshing. Thanks, Deb for sharing. Made for ZWT9."
440735,503216,2013/8/5,5,I liked this alot!  I actually sprinkled more seasoning on mine after the initial bite! Made for ZWT9 for the Gourment Goddesses July 2013.
386585,503216,2013/8/11,4,"This is a very unique way to enjoy watermelon, and takes a little getting used to!  I&#039;m not such a fan of cumin or chili powder, so I would probably reduce those next time.  But the hot pepper and the lime juice complement the sweetness of the melon nicely.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
169430,503117,2013/8/16,5,"What can I say? I&#039;ve been waiting for a full on tagine since the start of ZWT9. This was worth the wait. Excellent Moroccan flavors that keep on insisting that you just really need another bite. Really, it just doesn&#039;t care that you&#039;ve already eaten you share even if the tummy is telling you to stop! It&#039;s that good with the great spicing and tender moist chicken. Slurp"
895132,503117,2013/8/26,5,"This was the first ever tagine which I actually made in a tagine! BIG success, it was absolutely wonderful and got rave comments from both of us. Made this for the Tagine Cooking Class Challenge. Thanks for sharing this winner!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Morocco / Tunisia for The Apron String Travelers"
852554,503117,2013/8/31,5,"This was awesome! I just used a package of bone in, skinless chicken thighs and couldn&#039;t find preserved lemon for the life of me, so I used real lemon.   For my first ever tagine, it was a raging success!  Made for ZWT 9"
632249,514723,2014/4/12,5,"These cookies are like little bites of banana bread and are delicious!  The best part is that you can make them from so few ingredients and you probably have everything you need on hand, even on the day that the cupboards are bare. I&#039;ll definitely make these many more times. Thanks for the recipe! Spring PAC 2014."
1052873,514723,2014/4/19,4,"The photo looks like ground oatmeal was used and I think that would be a much better choice than whole oats. Also, I think walnuts would be a better flavor combination than chocolate chips. I&#039;ll try that the next time I have an overripe banana."
2123645,535627,2018/9/17,5,"I've never made a meal like this before, so I didn't know what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised! It's a bit labor intensive, but not too complicated. The directions are laid out very well. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the rice had the perfect texture. We loved the different dipping sauces, with the sweet soy sauce and green onion ginger being our favorites. I wasn't sure what type of hot sauce to use for the chili sauce, so I used Tabasco since that's what I had in the pantry. It was very spicy! The bok choy soup was good too. I couldn't find baby bok choy, so I used about half of a head of regular-sized bok choy. All in all it was a wonderful meal!"
220348,502741,2013/8/17,4,"I really enjoyed this recipe, and liked the addition of the chili. It really was hot, but my family was in the mood for it, and I find myself enjoying it more and more."
2000074629,502741,2015/3/20,5,"Love it! Heat AND flavor, yummy"
107583,504455,2013/7/30,5,Great cooking method.  I used tiny yellow potatoes I found at the Farmer&#039;s market and also added a little minced garlic (I minced too much for another dish and so just threw it in with the potatoes).  Great side for salmon.  Made for ZWT 9.
145352,504455,2013/7/30,5,"I used fairly large red potatoes, so I cut them into chunks. Nice side dish!! Made for ZWT 9!"
226863,504455,2013/7/30,5,I loved these!  This will be my go to recipe for baby red potatoes.  So easy and absolutely delicious!  Made for PRMR tag game.  Thanks for sharing!
2597942,504455,2013/8/3,5,"I made these for dinner the other night, and they cooked up beutifully! We loved the combo of the frying/steaming, the butter and the parsley (not big dill fans in our house).  I served these with pammyowls Recipe #504570 (which I made for &quot;New Kids&quot; tag) and we also had a salad. It was such a quick, easy and delightful meal. (Made these for ZWT9 - Scandinavian)"
383346,504455,2013/8/5,5,These baby potatoes are so yummy.  It&#039;s a lot of butter but it&#039;s worth it :)  It gives a lot of good taste to the potatoes.  Thanks pammy :)  Made for ZWT9
452355,504455,2013/8/7,5,"Easy and delicious, this is a foolproof method for cooking baby potatoes.  I followed the directions by cutting the potatoes in half (since they were a bit larger) and we garnished with dill.  Everyone really liked these.  Served with Recipe #504276 and roasted asparagus.  I&#039;d make these again.  Thanks!  Made for ZWT9"
228458,504455,2013/8/7,5,"Wow, these couldn&#039;t be easier and were sure tasty! I had rather large red potatoes so I cut them to size and followed the recipe from there. I *did* cut back the butter a smidge, using two tablespoons and adding 3 tablespoons of water to make up the difference for steaming. They still had that perfect mix of buttery salty goodness, and my family devoured them. Thanks for posting, fellow Goddess Pammy! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
131126,504455,2013/8/9,5,"I used red potatoes and trimmed cut them in thirds. The potatoes cooked easily, but they did need to be stirred fairly often to prevent burning.  That said, the potatoes were tasty &amp; my diners enjoyed them. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
895132,504455,2013/8/11,5,"Yum! Unluckily half of my baby potatoes had gotten bad, so I added some quartered larger potatoes. It worked beautifully and tasted wonderful with recipe #504392. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Scandinavia for The Apron String Travelers"
369715,504455,2013/8/28,4,These were so easy to make but they were very tasty. We all enjoyed these.
560491,504455,2013/9/3,5,"Very tasty!  I made about 1/2 lb since it is just me and I have enough for leftovers too.  They have a nice creamy flavor and even though my butter got a little dark, it didn&#039;t make the spuds taste burnt.  Made for ZWT9."
461834,504455,2013/11/14,5,"Very easy way to make red skinned potatoes!!  I could see many possibilities (including adding some cheese at the very end to melt) to add to this basic recipe.  I used Lawry&#039;s Seasoned Salt, in place of the regular salt, which added some great flavor, otherwise, made as written.  I sprinkled the parsley on once it was finished, for the color/garnish.  Pammyowl will be greatly missed in all the games and events here on food.com.  Made for her Cook-a-thon."
135566,504455,2013/11/17,5,"I  used Baby Yukon Gold potatoes instead of the red. Delicious, creamy and buttery potatoes that I will be making again and again.  Made for Pammy&#039;s cookathon."
323186,504455,2013/11/18,5,"I couldn&#039;t get red-skinned potatoes but these baby potatoes were equally delicious, and what a lovely simple way to prepare them!    Thank you Pammy, these were very much enjoyed.  Made in loving memory of a dear friend,  never forgotten"
653438,504455,2013/11/19,5,This is such a simple yet delicious recipe!   Used baby red potatoes and at the end of cooking sprinkled with fresh parsley.  Definately one to make again and again and try with some different fresh herbs.  Made in Memory of Pammyowl.
266635,504455,2013/11/26,5,"This is a great way to roast potatoes!  I let them cook a little longer than specified and they were really delicious.  Will definitely keep this recipe on my list for the future.  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
83314,504455,2014/5/21,5,Very delicious and easy.  I used gold potatoes instead of the red as that is what I had on hand.  Turned out buttery and creamy.
128473,505700,2013/10/17,5,"Well, twist my arm.... was this good.  Thank you my dear friend, we really enjoyed this quick and easy to make dinner.  The picky dh was in heaven, as was I....can&#039;t tell you how much I have been craving Thai food.  This is a wonderful basic recipe, I halved the recipe but added all the currry paste, as we love our curry spicy.  I used a sweet red hot pepper, so good.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy again and again."
285039,501188,2013/10/2,5,Delicious way to enjoy cauliflower!  Enjoyed it sans silverware!
1800980507,496457,2014/2/5,5,Very nice.
227978,533244,2017/9/1,5,"These were so easy (and quick) to make, and they tasted wonderful with a little honey drizzled over the top. They're like a cross between a thick pancake and a crispy baked bread roll. I just need to perfect my forming and patting ability so they look as appetizing as those we had on our Caribbean cruise about 10 years ago. I served them alongside Honey Drizzled Plantains and some fresh blue berries for breakfast this morning. Thanks, Nif. These were really good! Made for Culinary Quest 2017 (Central America)."
128473,533244,2017/9/6,5,"We really enjoyed these lovely Journey cakes Nif. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe. They are wonderful, thick, light, tender and fluffy. They have a very subtle coconut flavor. We enjoyed them with homemade Guava Jelly and a little whipped cream. Made for CQ4- Central America."
400708,513601,2014/5/2,5,"I&#039;ve never made Blondies before having always prefered chocolate brownies.  But couldn&#039;t resist the cinnamon in these.  They are so good, and the cinnamon sugar combo is just right.  Browning the butter really brings out the flavor in these yummy little squares.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
67728,513601,2014/5/9,5,"MMMM! The browned butter really sets these blondies apart from the rest. Chewy, buttery, cinnamony deliciousness! My only regret was not doubling the recipe, which I will most certainly do the next time I make these. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
2585084,501018,2013/5/30,5,"This tea was light, sweet and refreshing.i enjoyed it with barbecue chicken for supper. Thanks for posting the recipe."
47892,501018,2013/9/21,5,"This was very tasty! I added a hint of rosewater to the tea for fun! Local clover honey sweetened it perfectly, fresh basil from our CSA box and Tazo &#039;Awake&#039; black tea. I am interested in testing other berries for making the simple syrup. Made for Veg Tag/September."
37636,501018,2014/7/19,4,This is very good! We like that the basil gave a peppery mint-like character to the strawberries which wasn&#039;t quite the same as just using mint. Refreshing!
37449,504795,2013/10/4,5,"I scaled this down for one and enjoyed it! I used mayonnaise instead of salad dressing, personal preference. Thanks!"
2001766966,503195,2018/1/30,4,"I added frozen Kale,Green Beans,and Corn as well. The Cinnamon gave it a unique flavor."
480195,503195,2013/8/25,5,This is a very good soup recipe. I added an extra jalapeno and 1/2 tsp cumin. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.
107135,503867,2013/7/19,5,"sorry about the picture ,this was mr picky&#039;s  fish ,him being czech,loved the dill, perfect with the  toasted parsley orzo zwt 9 recipe #427813"
136997,506588,2013/9/4,5,"I liked the premise of this recipe. Since I don&#039;t care for processed food, I did make a couple of changes. I used a non packaged wild rice medley, which I cooked in chicken stock (for the flavor packet) and subbed in regular pork sausage for the smoked. I also added an extra clove of garlic. Tasty dish nevertheless. Made for New Kids on the Block Tag Game. :)"
1470072,494432,2013/9/12,5,Fan-flippin&#039;-tastic! I chose to try this recipe over others because it had more Nutella and less butter. Go figure - I actually wanted to taste the Nutella! And this recipe did not disappoint. I made a milk chocolate cake to go with it and the combination was divine. I am adding this to my regular recipes. Thank you so much for sharing your excellent recipe!
2000171703,494432,2015/4/28,5,"Very tasty, very easy, thank you so much"
2001278101,494432,2016/12/1,5,"Made some hazelnut cookies, and this was the perfect topping. Made the recipe as is, didn't need any milk :)"
2001526559,494432,2017/5/7,3,This calls for too much powdered sugar. Became dry and crumbly. Made it again with a third of the powdered sugar and it came out better.
2001590408,494432,2017/6/18,4,"I used this recipe on a mocha cake and it was the perfect counterpart to the bitterness! When you make this frosting you can't taste the chocolate in the Nutella as much and can more taste the hazelnut. My only complaint is that the ingredients would not mix so I tossed it in the microwave for 30 seconds and then put it in fridge so it would solidify. But after that, it was perfect!"
529278,494432,2017/9/8,5,"This was simple to whip up and was a lovely complement to my nutella brownies. I used my kitchenaid and had no problems putting in all of that powdered sugar. Make sure you sift it first though, and then measure out what you need. The consistency was great so it didn't need any milk, however I put in a splash of Frangelico, because I used that in the brownies."
2002206225,494432,2018/7/3,5,my family asked me to make all the cakes from now on.Said it was the best cake they ever ate.Just was a chocolate cake mix.So had to be the frosting.Allso made the buttercream frosting recipe for the vanilla tier.Allso amazing.
2002246526,494432,2018/8/13,5,I contend that it looks incredibly appealing and was incredibly tasty. This will be a new staple in my frosting recipe collection. Used it for my son’s first birthday cake since he LOVES Nutella and it was a major hit.
47892,493682,2013/6/12,5,The first batch I burnt beyond recognition. Eight minutes was much too long. This is my fault primarily because we have a new stove and this was only my second time using the broiler. The next batch I broiled the dates and apricots probably no more than 2 minutes and they were perfect. These are really delicious and I love the combination of flavors. Served with #173172.   Made for NA*ME tag/June
128473,499549,2013/5/14,5,"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe Zeldaz, it is wonderful.  It was quick and easy to make, had nice flavors and a great crumb.  I only made half the recipe, so I baked it in a cake pan, it worked great and tasted fantastic. It was equally as nice served fresh with some sweet butter as it was toasted the next day. Truly special served both ways.  I made this exactly as written, wouldn&#039;t change a thing. Made for New Kids on the Block Game."
400708,499549,2013/5/19,5,"I&#039;d seen this on Facebook too and was pleased to find you&#039;d posted it here; couldn&#039;t wait to make it and even happier with the results.  Made it exactly as posted and loved it, Went well with our dinner and I think I like it even better than the biscuits"
1800648686,499549,2013/12/11,5,This is a great comfort food to have with tea on a cold afternoon. I added garlic granules to make it a bit more tasty and healthy!
2000236715,499549,2015/5/30,5,"Ever since i first tasted these biscuits i became instantly hooked! There is no red lobster in Holland, this recipe is perfect! I didn&#039;t have any shortening, so i used Butter instead. Followed the recipe to the T and it was oohh soo Yummy!
It&#039;s also handy to use a cupcake pan if you have no cookie sheets! works just as perfect and gives the biscuits shape!"
2597942,509011,2013/11/7,5,This is a super simple and yummy recipe. I halved the ingredients and got 3-6&quot; flour tortilla wraps (just for hubby and I). I used the peppery arugula to make these. I&#039;m thinking that this recipe could make a great grilled ham and cheese sandwich and also a ham and cheese quesadilla (I may have to play with this). Thank you for posting your recipe CHEF GRPA.
2399085,509011,2013/11/11,5,Made for PRMR! This made a great lunch and the kids would admit that they loved them. I think it could be an easy staple lunch for years to come. Thanks...
2000833460,526526,2016/9/2,5,"This was sooo good! The prep took a lot longer than 15 minutes to spread the butter and place the cheese in between the slices, but was totally worth it. I used more jalapeno than it calls, probably about 1/4 cup, but followed the rest pretty much on point. My boyfriend and I almost ate the whole loaf! I will use more cheese next time, but this is definitely a keeper. Thanks!"
11279951,526526,2016/11/29,0,"Buttery, cheesy, carby goodness!"
1802660146,526526,2017/1/8,5,"I didn't have a loaf of bread, just some leftover whole wheat hamburger buns, so I spread the mixture on split buns, and baked it for few minutes. Turned out delicious anyway. Oh, and I didn't have jalape&ntilde;os and onions."
280271,515568,2014/8/13,5,What a surprise!...we loved it!...I decided to let the onion mixture spend 2 days in the frig marinating...I gave it a try after 1 hour...woohoo...did it taste like vinegar...and vinegar...so letting it sit for a while...I mean a long while...it mellowed out and was truly delicious...I grilled the skewers on the George Foreman Grill...took no time at all...very tender...I did cut the recipe in half and pureed the Chimichurri until smooth in my mini food processer...it worked like a charm...so hubby and I took a piece of meat...dipped in the green stuff (hubbies words) and added some pickled onion...Oh! Yum...so that is the way we ate through our dinner...thanks for sharing your recipe...=)
80353,515568,2014/8/19,5,Excellent and very flavouful!  DH grilled the skewers on the bbq and the flavour was awesome with the sauce.  The pickled onions were so quick to make and added a lot.  Turned this into fusion by stuffing into mini greek pitas.
314579,515568,2014/8/20,5,"Loved this dish!  Sauce was amazing and I loved the pickled onion.  Easy to overcook the meat which I did, but it really didn&#039;t matter with the sauce and onion.  I will be using the chimichuri and onion the rest of the week on different dishes!  Thanks Nancy!"
1802636312,515017,2014/4/1,5,Easy to follow directions. Delicious!
1802643345,515017,2014/4/5,5,Truly amazing!!
1802643397,515017,2014/4/5,5,"Loved it, will make it again!"
11341007,515017,2014/4/6,5,Easy recipe and great flavors.
1802644423,515017,2014/4/7,5,This is amazing! Breakfast foods has always been my favorite.Sometimes I&#039;ll have breakfast for dinner. This was really easy to make and so so good. Highly recommend!
2718847,496359,2013/3/2,5,"An easy, tasty, satisfying meal that is easy to make vegetarian! Follow the recipe as given, but substitute a package of Boca or Morningstar Farms  recipe crumbles from the frozen food section."
2001777331,521630,2018/10/24,5,Old school perfection. Thank you
2756448,497010,2013/3/27,5,Nice twist on the traditional samosa.
50509,493147,2013/2/13,4,"This was a really thick soup - chowder is a good description. I used broth in the first step, and also added a bay leaf, thyme and some whole peppercorns. I feel these really enhance vegetable soups such as this. I used regular cheddar, shredded, and I did use rather more, plus an additional amount as a garnish.  I nearly always have these ingredients around, so this is a good pantry dish. Even Mr Grumpy admitted he might eat this again."
133174,512688,2014/9/16,4,A nice moist snacking cake.  The only changes were to decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup and use Recipe #145505 for the spices.  The apples were finely cut but I think next time I would prefer to grate the apple.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
37449,509834,2013/12/6,5,"I halved the recipe, still using the one egg. I used a paper towel to wring out the excess water. These turned out really well and I served them with ketchup. Thanks!"
461834,509834,2013/12/30,5,"Great latkes, so comforting!!!  I have to confess that I cheated and used &quot;Simply&quot; hash brown potatoes, so I skipped the whole shredding/cheese cloth step, and I also reduced it to make two latkes.  Mine got a little more browned around the edges in the oven as I forgot to cut back the baking time for my convection oven, but they still were so good.  Served mine with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh chives.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Rosie!!!  Congrats again on your football win!!!"
266635,496523,2014/4/22,4,"This soup is quite tasty.  Unfortunately, I could not find the potatoes anywhere, so I substituted my own.  The only other change I made was to reduce the amount of chipotle peppers -- way too much heat for me.  This made a nice lunch today.  Made for Spring PAC, 2014."
50509,495574,2013/11/6,4,"I used Mexican crema for the sour cream and thinned it just a touch with kefir to make it a bit more mixable. This is an easy salad with most ingredients always in the pantry. I would not add walnuts again, they got soft and I did not care for the texture."
945395,496034,2013/2/23,5,"Wow, this is amazing, I love it! It's the Caesar salad dressing that makes it special. I used Best Foods real mayonnaise and (the West Coast brand of Hellman's). Thanks for sharing your great recipe."
47892,499606,2013/5/10,5,"I realized I&#039;ve made a similar recipe found on the food.com site. I infused the cinnamon&lt;br/&gt;with the butter and reduced the flour to make the sauce more pourable. If you use&lt;br/&gt;the full amount of flour it makes the sauce taste too grainy in my opinion. I tested with medjool dates. For color when taking the photo, I added a light garnish of fresh orange zest. Easy, pretty and delicious! Thanks for posting the recipe. Made for Welcome to Qatar!"
163112,499606,2013/5/10,4,This was delicious &amp; very easy.  I was surprised how much 10x I could add without it being to sweet.  It was delicious!  Dh thought it would be good over ice cream but the sauce hardened &amp; cracked.  He thinks it would work better over ice cream if the dates were chopped first.  I agree with reducing the flour to make the sauce less grainy.  Made for Welcome to Qatar!
593927,499606,2013/5/10,5,"We love this, DD1 (5 years old) DD2 (18 nmonths) and I. ! I made ours gluten free using a store bought gluten free flour mix, Al-Madina dates (Saudi), clarified organic sea salted butter, fake cinnamon (powdered cassia bark), and to top it off our healthy selves can`t stand any of that corn starch powdered sugar so we added none! Made for Welcome to Qatar! May 2013."
2000376924,528081,2017/10/16,0,"Found this same recipe on another site. Cooked it tonight. I have to say; verdict is a mixed bag. This is a tough one! Having worked at KFC as a fry cook years ago, I was very excited by the ingredient list. Once put together, it definitely reminded me of the smell of ripping open a new packet of &quot;Secret seasoning&quot;! so... that was good. Soaking in buttermilk for half an hour? Well, we didn't do that at the restaurant, but the chicken DID come in a vacuum sealed bag, so there could have been an equivalent marinade in the bag. So, I followed this recipe exactly and I also realize that raw chicken with bones will need cooked for a LONG time. Here is the sad part: I cooked this chicken for 15 minutes in a &quot;Fry Daddy&quot; fryer (verified 350 with candy thermo)...the breading was well burnt, while the chicken was appropriately cooked. As it was cooking I could see that the breading was burning, but it was too soon to pull out the chicken...I let it run the 15 minutes and pulled it out. It didn't come close to resembling the Colonel's chicken. I was hoping that the chicken itself would turn out to be overcooked so that I could try again at only 12 minutes...but that wasn't the case. The chicken was appropriately cooked and one of the legs was actually &quot;on the edge&quot; as far as sufficient cooking time... So, this leaves us with the problem that, in order to cook the chicken appropriately, we will end up burning the breading. IIRC, using a pressure fryer, it took 12 minutes to cook the chicken at KFC, but after 15 minutes (not pressure fried) the breading was &quot;burnt as could be&quot;. Looking at the ingredient list, I see a lot of things that are &quot;burn prone&quot; (like Black Pepper, white pepper, paprika, etc... ) so...if Anyone has any ideas on how to make this without burning the breading, please chime in! * I am considering &quot;parboiling&quot; the chicken for the next go 'round so I can only fry the chicken around 6 minutes...( I hate to par-boil due to flavor loss) and at KFC we definitely never par boiled anything... Any thoughts or suggestions? Edit: I used vegetable oil instead of peanut. I think this may make a difference."
119577,508702,2014/1/6,5,"Delicious!  I made mine with chicken, and the only substitution I made was 1/4 cup regular sour cream plus 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, because I didn&#039;t have lowfat sour cream on hand.  This is a hearty and filling soup that is definitely better the next day, after being refrigerated overnight.  You may need to add a bit of water when you reheat it as the rice absorbed a lot of the moisture.   Definitely a keeper!"
2001552546,525834,2017/6/11,3,"This was TASTY! It was colorful, warm, and smelled amazing. My Mom added cashews and almonds to her dish. I might add a little orange zest next time, or possibly a sliced hard boiled egg."
2001381796,530208,2017/2/6,5,Ohhhh my goodness. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but my sister loves the stuff. I made this for her and I think I ate more than she did. Delicious. I will make this again for sure!
383346,497765,2013/6/3,5,I made half the recipe and got 6 pancakes.  Perfect for the 3 of us.  2 pancakes per serving.  At first I found them too thin but finally they were perfect.  Great taste.  They were great with maple syrup.  Thanks O-mama :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game
653438,497765,2013/8/5,5,Made these for our breakfast this morning and I cut the recipe in half added some blueberries and these turned out light and fluffy.  DH really enjoyed them with maple syrup.  Thank you for posting the recipe.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag game 2013.
2000498330,498888,2018/6/23,5,A scrumptious breakfast bread. Somewhat dense texture with a hint of ginger and plenty of raisins. Very nice toasted w/ butter. Happy.
171790,506019,2013/9/14,5,"What a delightful meal. I made a rather big mistake and bought broccoli in stead of kale. I think the recipe worked quite well with that unintentional substitution. Organic red quinoa was used since that&#039;s what I had on hand. I think the white variety would look nicer with this dish, however. The quinoa was cooked in my rice cooker which worked very nicely. Made for Veggie Swap 62."
1052873,517911,2014/10/8,5,This was great - so flavorful. I had some leftover lamb I put in this too. I got the idea from CQ14 but made this after the contest was over.
2001149656,523981,2016/9/11,3,"Simple, easy to make casserole. Kids would love this, nothing hidden that they don't want! I only gave it 3 stars because it was sort of bland. For me it could use a little more spice. I'm thinking next time I might cook the chicken differently so it has more flavor. Also thinking of using a more flavorful cheese or a blend of the jack with cheddar. It's a good recipe. I'm going to use it as a starting point and start experimenting!"
266635,499805,2014/12/31,5,"Yummy!  I like the Swiss cheese and cheddar combo with the Swiss cheese making a more pronounced flavor presence along with the nuttiness of the pecans.  The cream cheese adds a nice creamy texture to this spread. Served this yummy snack with celery sticks, but I plan to also serve it with some whole grain crackers. Made for the For Your Consideration tag game."
844554,493041,2013/4/20,5,Great tasting chicken and SO easy which I love. I cut it down to use for 2 tenderloins and baked only 20 minutes. Made for PAC Spring 2013.
1800077962,493041,2015/8/28,4,I made this &amp; it was very good but I didn&#039;t check the temp. until 40 min. had passed &amp; it was 185 degrees so next time I&#039;ll check it after 30 min. was still very good just a little over cooked!
2001348739,493041,2017/1/12,0,definitely quick easy and tasty.. thank u..
126440,507627,2014/6/24,5,Turned out great even if I didn&#039;t have balsamic vinegar so used balsamic glaze.  Used Kale from the garden and first time using it.  Was great.
2001423387,496425,2017/3/8,0,Thank you these recipe is one of my favorite it's been 7uears I never eat Now I can cook
1802625731,514944,2014/3/29,5,"Awesome recipe! I use the green chile rotel and boneless chops and it comes out amazing - Good, old fashioned recipe, really makes the pork moist and tender -"
1802491411,514944,2014/3/29,5,"Made this last night and everyone loved it! The pork was moist and tender, not dried out like so many other baked pork chop recipes. I served it with warm flour tortillas so the kids could make &quot;burritos.&quot; So next time I will probably use boneless pork chops, but I wouldn&#039;t otherwise change a thing. Thanks Chef #514944 for a quick and easy &quot;something different.&quot;"
498271,504416,2013/9/28,4,Really tasty oatmeal!  The lemon was subtle and perfect with the blueberry.  I have to admit I&#039;ve never added egg whites to oatmeal before; there wasn&#039;t a noticeable change in flavor or texture but added protein so that&#039;s a good thing.  Honey is a great sweetener for this; I was afraid it wouldn&#039;t be sweet enough but it was just right.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for My3Chefs 2013
58104,501175,2013/6/21,4,"I cut back to 2 servings then found this served more like 4-6 servings. The peas I didn&#039;t cook no need. I used frozen roasted corn, the tuna was a 5 ounce can, the kidney beans I used the whole 14 ounce canned, loved the pickles in this it was a nice tease every now n then making you want more. I did add a red bell pepper that I had left over from an other recipe. As for the dressing I did double the chili sauce. Tasted at that point and was delish but after chilling it could have used more dressing. We would have enjoyed some heat from pepper flakes or a jalapeno. That being said all in all very good. You got the tang from the pickles and lime, Sweet from the sauce, corn and raisins, salty from the tuna and then all the textures!! But I must say left overs were dry and need some babying. So make and serve the same day."
160977,501175,2013/6/22,4,This makes a lot! Although I halved the recipe it was still more than plenty. The dressing is tangy and goes well with the salad. The leftovers needed a little more juice so I made some more dressing the next day. I think I would have preferred chick peas instead of the kidney beans but that is a matter of taste. All in all a good recipe with potential to play with. Thanks for creating and posting. Made for Raiders of the Lost Pantry Contest.
2000436514,513263,2015/8/28,5,I made this dish for a ladies&#039; luncheon and they all loved it and wanted the recipe which I gladly wrote for them.  I did not have italian sausage so I used 2 lbs. ground beef.  I make my own sauce but used what the recipe called for and it was delicious.
219942,504718,2013/8/3,5,"Wow, this was so good! Everyone raved about it, and between 4 of us the whole dish was gone! The recipe didn&#039;t specify what the other 14 oz. corn should be, probably canned and drained, (?), but I used the kernels of one ear of fresh corn combined with the creamed, and will do it that way from now on. It was sweet, and different than any corn dish I&#039;ve ever made. Sweet and delicious! I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and was glad I did. Thanks for a great recipe that I will make often."
1982835,504718,2015/11/15,5,"Have been looking for a corn pie recipe like my mom&#039;s for years and I FINALLY found it!  I did change the recipe up slightly and added 2 tbsp of butter, 3 tbsp of flour and 1 tsp salt.  I also drained the whole kernel corn.  PERFECT &amp;  DELICIOUS!"
2001826529,504718,2017/11/26,0,"Wow, this recipe was SPOT ON! I've tried a corn pie recipe in the past that included corn meal as an ingredient and it came out a mess. This recipe is the corn pie that I know and love. Thank you!"
266635,505145,2014/5/26,5,"Made this wonderful greek salad to go with my bbq dinner today -- it will add a nice fresh and healthy addition to my meal.  The only change I made was to add kalamata olives to the salad and I added a little fresh lemon juice to the dressing which is delicious.  Made for PRMR, May, 2014."
184530,505145,2015/1/25,5,"I made this tonight and we loved it. I used Perino tomatoes halved, a Lebanese cucumber and I halved the dressing quantity.  Not have any chickpeas, I used an avocado.  Delicious!"
227652,535952,2018/10/31,5,"This was wonderful. That's my main review, but the tweaks will explain more!"
2873700,529033,2017/7/10,0,This might be better made with frozen dinner rolls quartered and flattened. I'll let y'all know.
1706426,507210,2013/10/9,5,"Very good! I did leave out the olives as DDH doesn&#039;t care for them, but otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing, made for PRMR 2013/"
386585,507210,2013/10/17,4,"I made this exactly as posted, adding some fresh basil, as suggested.  I used kalamata olives and halved my cherry tomatoes.  The salad itself was a great combination, and the dressing was pretty flavorful.  However, I did find 1/2 cup olive oil was a bit too much and made the dressing more oily and rather thin.  I will definitely make this again, reducing the olive oil.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
453383,494306,2013/1/28,5,This really looks delicious. Would be great for a dinner party! Got to try this soon!
2000737867,524970,2015/12/10,5,Mediterranean food has such great flavor. Pine nuts are so good and a nice addition to this yummy dish!
2000738584,524970,2015/12/10,5,Delish!
2000739318,524970,2015/12/11,5,"Ragu 7 Herb Tomato Sauce adds a tasty twist to the pasta when blended with grilled balsamic chicken. The Kalamata olives, arugula, feta, and pine nuts and additional appeal and nutrition."
2425065,510272,2014/4/10,5,"I started making these cookies back in the 90&#039;s: a FANTASTIC cookie, always a hit.  This Toll house recipe is the same as another reviewed recipe on this site, &quot;Orange Dream Cookies&quot;, which has glowing reviews."
1925885,527422,2016/8/8,5,"So good! This was easy to make and was wonderful with my Bahamian dinner! It kind of reminded me of Mexican rice, except for the addition of the pigeon peas, and the thyme gave it a great punch of flavor. I did find that I had to add more water, because it dried out before the rice was cooked. But with that simple fix, the rice turned out wonderful! Thanks for posting! Made for CQ3, team Pi Rho Maniacs."
2002153622,535691,2018/5/15,0,This looks lovely! Too pretty to eat; but I would like to give it a try.
498271,507441,2013/10/17,4,Nice preparation for fish!  The soy and the OJ are a great combination.  I couldn&#039;t resist adding a generous dash of crushed red pepper flakes to cut the sweetness a bit.  Easy and tasty recipe - thanks for sharing it!  Made for My3Chefs 2013
2000387131,507441,2015/8/6,0,"My boys were not enthusiastic about tilapia for dinner, although they love all fish. I used this marinade and they wanted more! Will definitely do this again!"
157167,503131,2013/7/16,5,"Excellent!  I used pinto beans since they have a similar mild flavor, and I already had them in my pantry :-)  I used the ham hock option, and used a pound of meaty bones for a double batch of beans.  I prefer to leave out the pepper and double the onion, but that is just my preference.  For ZWT9"
461834,503131,2013/7/23,5,"Oh my BK!!!  What a wonderful recipe for this bean soup!!!   I am a wimp when it comes to heat, so the recipe really was wonderful as I didn&#039;t need to cut back on anything for our/my tastes!!  I did make a change, I added some slivered carrots, but that was the only change I made to this recipe.  I served this with some buttered soda crackers for a yummy lunch (DH had 2 buttered slices of French Bread).  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
539686,503131,2013/7/26,5,This is a delicious and easy to tailor bean soup. I had a bag of mixed beans and used those as well as chicken stock instead of water. I also bought a couple of thick slices of deli ham and use those instead of the ham bone. I like leaving the heat up to the individual and passed the Tabasco sauce with the soup! Made for ZWT 9.
133174,503131,2014/1/21,4,The recipe was doubled and the beans soaked overnight.  The next morning everything except the tomatoes was placed in the crock pot and cooked until almost tender.  Once the beans started to soften the tomatoes were stirred in and the beans were allowed to finish cooking.  I did add in the hot sauce and served with additional Tabasco on the side.  I think we would have enjoyed a little more spice.  This was served with fresh baked corn muffins and green onions.  Made for Aussie Swap.
169430,503131,2017/1/18,5,"A beautiful soup for winter, well, for any time actually. It got excellent reviews from my family and it's been requested to appear again soon. I'm so glad that I tried this as it will become a &quot;go to&quot; soup recipe for me. I served it with cornmeal biscuits."
2001991619,503131,2018/2/14,5,I made the recipe with no meat at all for a delicious vegetarian version! I added a bit more water to keep the soup thinner.
369715,502300,2013/6/28,5,I really liked this. I marinated this for about an hour but next time I would do it over night as it didn&#039;t really draw through the chicken. I used tenderloins as that is what I had pulled. The sauce is great. I ate some and froze the rest. I followed the recipe other then I didn&#039;t add the red pepper flakes as I didn&#039;t have any.This would be great on top of rice.
169430,499511,2013/5/9,5,"Photo may be seen here (in Savor): www.annacia.com.&lt;br/&gt;I made 2 servings of this yummy recipe using pimento stuffed green olives (I have 3 jars that I&#039;m trying to use, lol), sliced carrot, and added a small scatter of raisins in place of the bit of sugar. It&#039;s quick and simple to make and light enough on the calories to leave no guilt. The flavors are great and I would surely make this again."
724631,499511,2013/7/24,4,"This was a pleasant supper dish that went together quickly; the flavors blended to perfection for our leftovers.  Updated: raised to 4 stars now that directions specify when to add garlic.   The saffron rice was perfect!  The skillet steps timed nicely with the rice&#039;s 20 minutes.  I question the need to preheat the oven to 350F when the chicken has already been cooked during stir-frying; wouldn&#039;t a warm setting do the trick?  For my taste, I would halve the orange zest and the cardamom.  Please consider listing the ingredients in the order used, as that makes it easier to follow.  Also, it would be helpful to designate whether your herbs and spices were dried/ground or fresh.  I used the Shopping List and bought fresh ginger, but decided during prep that you intended ground ginger.  For us, the chicken (2 U.S. super-sized breasts) made 2-3 servings, and the rice made 4-5 servings.  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
37449,515446,2014/5/19,5,"I&#039;m rating this mostly for the sauce, as I used already breaded veggie &quot;chicken&quot;. Absolutely delicious with a mix of brown and white rice with lentils added. Thanks!"
204024,515446,2014/9/9,4,"Sauce is delicious and perfect. We had a bit of trouble with the breading process and would not have added marinade liquid to the dry coat before rolling the chicken in it. the lumpy dry coat resulted in hard chunks in the finished product, too. We had a bit too much chicken for the recipe and the extra just got rolled in cornstarch instead of the dry coat mixture, and those pieces were every bit as good. We will definitely make this sauce again and twice as much!"
2001102678,530479,2017/4/25,5,Good for st Patrick day due to that is green
964677,513507,2015/1/21,5,"Delicious soup.  I used the veggies listed in slightly different proportions, but no matter.  After they all cooked in the broth, I added a can of 2% evaporated milk and about 2 oz of chive/herb cream cheese (half a little tub).  Also used just 2 strips of bacon and sauteed 3 big chopped cloves of garlic in the bacon fat to save the trouble of roasting a whole head of garlic, and it was fine.  With the chicken broth, it didn&#039;t need any more salt, but a little sprinkle of pepper and cayenne pepper. Don&#039;t leave out the herbs. Served with a bit of shredded cheese in each bowl and some garlic toast. Made enough for six people, so we&#039;ll have it again a few times.  Very rich and satisfying taste."
2002262774,521342,2018/8/31,1,"Actually so gross. 0/10 Do not recommend. The batter is way too dry, and just soaks up all the oil. I used a candy thermometer and fried at the exact temperature noted, but by the time all the batter looked even remotely cooked, the outside was crispy and disgusting. They CRUMBLED on the outside and were still raw on the inside. I thought maybe they would taste better with the glaze, but once cooled they were even worse. These 'doughnuts' literally just taste like cold, pure canola oil. A waste of time and ingredients."
1803526023,519890,2014/12/19,4,This is a great recipe to try if you need a snack
1905182,519890,2016/2/24,3,Pretty easy to make and I had the ingredients on hand for last minute appetizer. I salted the tots before I wrapped them because I am not too into sweet stuff. I also left the tots frozen and wrapped them and then let them thaw. Much easier to handle this way. No squished tots.  Thanks.
1675225,497476,2013/7/15,5,"This is a wonderful soup.  When making the roux, I added the broth to the flour/butter mixture instead of the milk. ( I was afraid of curdling.)  When somewhat thick I added the veggies and simmered for the designated time.  Instead of the half and half and used a combination of evaporated milk and almond milk.  I did not puree the veggies."
1239906,497476,2014/3/18,5,"This was amazing!  I can&#039;t wait to make it again, this batch did not last long at all.  Like comment below mine, I also did not puree the veggies."
2001871870,497476,2017/12/20,5,"Great recipe that our house enjoys many occasions, regular family meals and potlucks."
251917,512382,2014/4/28,5,Aussie Swap #87: DELICIOUS! Reminds me of &quot;Twice-baked potatoes&quot; that we have made in the past! The filling is heavenly - especially with the flavor of the mustard powder and cheese! Thank you Tarty!
2001102678,512382,2017/4/25,5,Yummiest
515278,516627,2014/6/10,5,Easy and tasted good too! Served with garlic green beans and rice.
2001342304,504130,2017/1/8,2,This recipe looks like it was copied from the Pillsbury site verbatim. Made it before and it was very... wet ( the melted butter being the main culprit).
2423055,515145,2014/3/31,5,This looks DELICIOUS and I&#039;m dying to try this recipe as my husband loves salmon and this is perfect with the potato and vegie crust. This is a winner in my book!
2216338,515145,2014/3/31,5,"OMGOSH, this is one fantastic recipe.  It&#039;s simple and delicious!  sw?"
2667767,515145,2014/3/31,5,Looks soooooo yummy!
2440395,515145,2014/3/31,5,Delish!!!  :)
306726,515145,2014/4/1,5,Yum! I&#039;d love to take a big bite!
2201427,515145,2014/4/1,5,Awesome recipe!!!
2201870,515145,2014/4/1,0,"Wow, yummy!"
2729690,515145,2014/4/1,0,looks so delish
2192609,515145,2014/4/1,5,Great recipe and use of ingredients!  thank you for the recipe!
1800407045,505195,2013/12/4,5,loved this dip
1802462372,505195,2014/2/7,5,awesome!!!
168921,505195,2014/4/16,5,We had this dip with veggies. Very good. Will make again.
2000174754,534000,2017/11/11,5,There is a saying where I come from in North Carolina that 'apple pie without cheese is like a kiss without a squeeze'. It is down right ingenious to put it in the crust.
226867,497132,2015/11/9,5,"I confess, I shortened the marinating time to 24 hrs and cooked the meat in a crockpot! I had invited company for Sunday dinner and didn&#039;t read the recipe carefully enough to realize I need a few days for marinating - despite that, it was excellent. The meat was super tender and flavorful. I chose a different cut of meat - chuck roast seemed too fatty so I bought a boneless eye of round. Also, I don&#039;t know how &quot;gingerbread&quot; translates, but I used &quot;ginger snaps&quot; in the sauce. Every recipe in the states for sauerbraten that I&#039;ve ever seen calls for ginger snaps - in fact, I don&#039;t even know if gingerbread is commercially available except for at Christmas time. Anyway, we loved this! Danke!"
128473,495162,2014/4/30,4,"This was a lovely recipe.  I enjoyed it.  The salad was light, flavorful and refreshing.  It was quick and easy to make.  All in all a very nice lunch treat.  I prepared exactly as the recipe was written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
46256753,511943,2014/2/17,5,I have made this many times.  It is the easiest soup I&#039;ve ever made and it is delicious.  I always add some crisp bacon crumbled up into the soup at the end of cooking. It is also really good to put some shredded cheddar cheese on top if you really want to go nuts!
369715,499942,2013/7/3,4,"I had never used vinegar when making my hard boiled eggs, I have always added salt. The vinegar worked OK. I cooked 18 eggs and three of them I couldn&#039;t get the shells off of them. The others were fine. I used some of the eggs for red beets and the rest to make your egg salad. This is exactly how we like our egg salad, basic. I did add a good bit of pepper and salt. We all enjoyed this."
2597942,500920,2013/6/2,5,"I have made this recipe twice now, I just didn&#039;t review it before. I made it the 1st time (per instructions), using Hellmans mayo and the 1/2 cup onion called for. It was quite good, but did not seem to have much flavor other than onion &amp; mayo (which is why I would have only given it only 4 stars). But the 2nd time, making this today, I used Miracle Whip (light) salad dressing and 1/4 cup of onion and it was great! I guess it&#039;s all personal preference (its nice that you can adjust it easily to your own taste, and so very easy to assemble... thanks for the options). I used elbow macaroni (TIP: my 2nd time I only boiled the noodles to al dente because my 1st attempt got mushy after mixing everything in, so DO NOT over cook your pasta &amp; be sure to let it sit for at least an hour in the fridge so that the flavors can mingle). I did not use the pickle/relish option (just because I don&#039;t like it). Thank you for posting a terrific recipe that brought back many childhood memories."
88099,500920,2013/11/17,3,"This was okay, but the peas overpowered all other ingredients.  I think I would cut the peas in half.  I used shredded cheddar cheese which made it easier to eat.  But other than that made as directed.  I think I might add some tuna to help add some flavor to this dish.  I did have to add additional light mayo as the instructions indicated.  Made in honor of the life of pammyowl."
1925885,522747,2015/8/28,5,"Ten stars!!!  These were so, so good!  I did the quick soak method, and because they have no pinto beans here, I had to use black beans. No matter. These were just excellent. The coffee with the molasses adds a deep complexity to the dish. And the finishing touch is the bourbon. I also added about 1/4 tsp instant espresso towards the end, to liven up the coffee flavor. Simply amazing. Made for Culinary Quest 2 by a Toasted Tourist."
266635,497804,2013/8/19,5,Sooo good!  Loved every aspect of this dish -- the delicious eggplant and the peanut sauce was to die fo.  I used Japanese eggplant as I prefer it and that&#039;s what I had on hand.  The only other change was to substitute cilantro for parsley. This is so easy to make and looks wonderful on the platter. Served this dish with rice and it was an absolutely wonderful lunch today.  Made for ZWT-9.
452355,497804,2013/8/22,4,"This made for an easy to prepare, nicely plated dinner last night.  We liked it.  Served over basmati rice.  Thanks!  Made for ZWT 9"
1804358,501041,2015/3/28,1,"Nothing remotely like crust.  Increased time and temperature at both phases of baking and the end product had the texture of an undercooked, mealy souffl&eacute;.  It was more like pizza hot dish."
2202578,501041,2013/6/16,4,Not bad. Instead of cooking the constructed pizza at 350 .. had to cook it at 400 to get it done to taste.
2955263,501041,2013/8/22,5,"I&#039;ve fixed this twice pretty much exactly as the recipe is written and loved it both times.  It&#039;s been a little greasy (fine with me, but the wife can&#039;t handle too much grease) becasue I didn&#039;t drain the hamburger and sausages I used on it.  Sure you can&#039;t pick up a piece and eat it like a regular pizza slice, but the crusst has enough firmness to it to feel like regular pizza while eating it with a fork.  And the taste you get from the crust is very good."
1800038578,501041,2013/8/30,5,Delicious! Great low carb recipe that satisfies my pizza craving!
1800986364,501041,2013/12/19,5,Very good recipe for those who have to be gluten free. We do not make this often but have served it for a child&#039;s birthday party and the kids never realized it was not &quot;regular crust&quot;! That should tell you something.
1802553337,501041,2014/3/5,5,This is a GREAT low carb recipe!!  LOVED IT!!
1802634723,501041,2014/4/1,5,Oh my goodness! This was delicious! My husband and I have been eating low carb no sugar for 2 months now and we both really missed pizza but this recipe just saved my craving. This will definitely be a regular on our menu. Thank you!
2552497,501041,2014/5/4,2,"I knew when I put it in the oven and it started smelling like garlicky goodness that this was a tasty recipe! and it was. I even substituted fat-free cream cheese, and it was good. But even though I baked it at 400 for some of the 20 minutes, it came out kinda doughy and almost like an omelette. I&#039;d recommend using less egg. And spreading it out to where it&#039;s like paper thin, because that way it&#039;ll be crunchy."
1802758143,501041,2014/8/4,5,"This is great for low-carb dieters or people who are grain-free. It doesn&#039;t taste just like &quot;real&quot; pizza, but it definitely satisfies the pizza craving, and it&#039;s pretty easy to put together with regularly available ingredients. It&#039;s nice to have low-carb recipes where I don&#039;t have to hunt down some unusual ingredient in order to make it. Also it&#039;s very filling, 2 small pieces were all I needed."
1803009808,501041,2014/8/10,0,"i made this and it was awesome, I cooked my crust for 30 min to crisp it up more, my whole family scarffed it down! this one&#039;s a keeper!"
98919,501041,2014/10/12,5,"OMG I LOVED this!! I like a soft crust, so I just cooked it until there were spots of golden brown on it, which it still took 25-30 minutes to get it to that point. I used recipe #37563 (Big Batch Spaghetti Sauce) for the sauce. I used hamburger, chopped onion, saut&eacute;ed mushrooms and used more parmesan for the topping. My grandkids thought it was a crescent roll crust. Delicious!!  I had to bake the pizza longer than called for to get the cheese melted. Thanks for sharing!"
1803731756,501041,2015/1/31,5,"We had a lot of trouble with another recipe, but this one wi yt? h cream cheese is great! It was very, very simple and flaky. I think I should make it a bit thicker. Love this idea since we are loving low carb eating, but missing pizza."
1803766972,501041,2015/2/9,5,"Tried this last night. It was a hit--even my 11 year old picky-ish eater who doesn&#039;t really like pizza loved it. I&#039;ll definitely have to cook it longer to get the crust just right, but it&#039;s an instant favorite."
2000228207,501041,2015/6/3,5,This recipe definitely fills a pizza craving for us low carb lovers.  I found I like it better cold as the &quot;crust&quot; hardens more and it can be eaten like an actual slice of pizza.
2000432157,501041,2015/8/26,1,"I cooked this much longer than stated and it never hardened like a crust, it&#039;s soft  and taste more like a lasagna, good but not a crust replacement."
2000535651,501041,2015/10/7,4,"This recipe is good for low carb. I doubled the recipe and instead of black pepper I did Italian spices and the garlic powder. The good thing is you can put whatever you like on top and it will still be low carb. I do mushrooms, bacon, and green peppers and onions."
1803517744,501041,2015/10/11,4,"Was good, but more like a pizza hot dish as the crust is a soft dough like texture.  Next time, I am going to try placing in on a pizza stone or cookie sheet and bake it at 425 on the lowest rack or place it on the grill and see if I can get the crust to harden up a bit.  I like a crisp crust and this just doesn&#039;t do it for me.  It was also really filling.  I couldn&#039;t eat more than two pieces and I can usually eat a whole froze pizza myself."
2000853073,501041,2016/2/2,4,"Thought all in all this was good.  I added 2 teaspoons fresh thyme to the cheese mixture.  We used no sauce and mexican style cheese as that was the only shredded cheese we had.  Ground Beef, onion, garlic, and mushrooms were our toppings.  So Dad thought it was real good and he is diabetic.  Mom said it was alright which around here means if she does not have to cook and it was alright she would definitely eat it again.  Her high praise for me has been always its alright or the other responses she gives are once a month, never again, holidays only, and once a week.  If it gets an alright then was good."
2000892726,501041,2016/2/27,5,Have made this 3 times.  Always satisfies our pizza craving.  Used lots of veggies and cheese and added chopped green chile (which all of us New Mexicans put on our pizza)  baked on my pizza stone and turned out great
2001259433,501041,2016/11/21,4,Just tried this and it was good. Will make again but will find a way to crisp up the &quot;crust&quot;. Thanks for the recipe :)
2001274511,501041,2016/11/28,5,Ooey gooey delicious
2001303349,501041,2016/12/17,5,I been doing this recipe for years. Its more like a casserole but its delicious ... I use spaghetti sauce but its tasteful..
2001314200,501041,2016/12/22,0,No domestic goddess here. This was easy to make and the aroma of the &quot;crust&quot; cooking was heavenly ....I had to cook everything longer as I have an electric convection oven and not a full stove oven...but it was fine. Crust is very soft...but SO delicious. Quite filling...two pieces will surprise you at how full you will feel. FIVE STARS because it is really good and I hate to cook.
2001338916,501041,2017/1/6,5,"O...M...Yummmm!!! So good, I called it Healthy Meat Lovers Supreme. Will be making this weekly!!! And inexpensive!"
2001406653,501041,2017/2/26,5,OMG..... I didn't think it was possible. Really fantastic!!!! So delicious! Must try if you are low carb. Oh and Rao's Pizza sauce was perfect compliment and chorizo instead of pepperoni. The crust works as a crust should. I.e. You can eat a slice with out getting your hands messy.
2001466610,501041,2017/4/1,5,"I am on a low carb/sugar free diet and I had a bad craving for pizza. This hit the spot really well. I left the crust in for as long as it stated in the recipe and it was really soft when I ate it--like slightly firmer than lasagna filling, so I ate with a fork. However, it was REALLY good! I'm not sure anyone would be fooled that this is real pizza crust, but I would eat this even if I wasn't on a restrictive diet. Next time I make it, I will definitely leave it in longer on higher heat to see if it gets crisp."
2001466988,501041,2017/4/1,5,"I made 1/2 the recipe and I have a trick! After 20 minutes baking the &quot;crust&quot; I brushed w/ Olive Oil, garlic and fresh Parm cheese...baked for another 10 minutes. It was super crunchy....cooled for 30 minutes! Added my sauce (olive oil, garlic, onion, wine, fresh tomatoes) that I reduced to a yummy sauce. I finished my pizza with the sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, pepperoni and jalopenos. Will add pics later....SO YUMMY! Was on my way to cheat since I was craving Pizza, this saved my thighs!! LOVE IT"
279222,501041,2017/4/2,5,"This was great! I put about a half cup of parmesan (or more) because my eggs were jumbo. Also added some oregano and a tablespoon of coconut flour. I didn't have sauce or mozzarella in the house, so I topped with some leftover broccoli, pepperoni and a mexican cheese blend. Came out pretty tasty!"
2001254489,501041,2017/5/11,5,"Still in shock about how this turned out! Topped with hamburger, onions, mushrooms, pepperoni and a mix of three cheeses. (Cheeses) parmesan, jack-cheddar combo and mozzarella. The only tweaks I did were the following; added a half tablespoon of Splenda to sweeten the crust, two tablespoons of coconut flour and a blender to combine everything. This recipe is unbelievable!!"
2001542811,501041,2017/5/18,3,It was ok I have tried so many but the best I have found is https://www.califlourfoods.com/?afmc=6u
2001569712,501041,2017/6/5,5,"This recipe is incredible. I am in ketosis and ate this pizza as a test to see if it would throw me out. Nope! I am soooo happy. Pizza is my favorite junk food so finding a way to eat it without all of the carbs and extra trash in it, is amazing. I honestly feel like I will never order pizza again. I followed the recipe except added coconut flour and brushed the top with avocado oil mixed with italian seasonings and sprinkled cheese when the crust started browning, let cheese melt, pulled out let cool. Made my own pizza sauce, topped with italian 5 cheese blend, prosciutto, bacon bits and basil. Yummmmmmy."
2001572746,501041,2017/6/7,5,"I wish I would have taken a picture, it turned out so perfect! I made the crust then let it set til later when my son came over. He put on the cheese and his toppings: pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage, then we put it in the oven for about 10 minutes. OMG! it was fabulous! We were able to pick it up like pizza, and it tasted as good as, if not better, than delivery (knowing it was low carb)! and definitely better than frozen! I am so impressed! and so was my son, who is 25 years old and eats take out all of them time, lol. 5 stars for this, Thank You!"
2001624431,501041,2017/7/13,5,Great recipie! I added a tbsp worth of seasoning in the batter and sprinkled some on before I baked it the second time. Came out perfect.
2001657343,501041,2017/8/4,5,Turned out amazing! Followed exact directions.
2001754028,501041,2017/10/15,3,The best crisp crust for no carb is at fatheadpizza.com It is Crisp And you can pick it up. This recipe is good for a change. I added 1\2 c almond flour and 1\2 cup mozzarella to crust. That helps to firm it up. To make this crisper do not use 9x13 use a cookie sheet with parchment paper and spread it to about 14x12. Use an off set spatula dipped in water if the &quot;dough&quot; is too sticky.
2001790153,501041,2017/11/12,4,Loved the recipe. Pretty tasty!
2001898565,501041,2017/12/29,5,The very best recipe!
2000885334,501041,2018/1/7,5,"Flavor is great. If your looking for pizza crust like consistency, your not going to find it here, but you don't even miss it with this recipe. If you eat it once it has gotten cold, you can actually eat it like pizza in your hands and it is more &quot;crust&quot; like cold. Definitely will make it again."
2000782909,501041,2018/1/28,0,Good tasting but we missed the crunch of the pizza crust.
2002016822,501041,2018/2/26,4,Wow! This is great! I will be making again. For crispy crust I layed down a layer of shredded parm first and baked that for 5 minutes. Then poured batter over and continued recipe. Outstanding.
2002078791,501041,2018/4/14,4,"Best low carb pizza crust ever! Really easy to make, and you can hold it like regular pizza. Tastes pretty good...the more toppings, the better!"
2002215790,501041,2018/7/12,1,In my opinion there was too much garlic powder. Taste was not great. But not horrible. Probably won't make again.
2001464932,530867,2017/3/31,0,How much flour? You left that out.
38643,511251,2014/3/17,5,Sorry I forgot to rate these earlier.  I made them for a family get together and everyone enjoyed them.  I can&#039;t wait to make them again for our Fourth of July party.  They are a nice change of pace from your regular dessert.
226867,509660,2016/7/31,5,"This was a very tasty salad! I had trouble finding black eyed peas and I bet one could sub another kind of bean. Nice dressing, - simple and zippy! made for CQ2016 IHPi"
482376,509660,2016/8/11,5,"Excellent! I made this in the morning and we are enjoying it as an appetizer, with tortilla chips, right now. Great flavor! It was simple to prepare, too. I halved the recipe and it still made a lot! Thank you."
37449,505620,2013/8/20,5,"Used homemade Ras al Hanout, this was so good!  I did quarter the potatoes. Made for ZWT 2013 by team Hot Stuff. Thanks!"
80353,505620,2013/8/22,5,Really wonderful way to do roasted potatoes.  The ras el hanout was the bomb!
266635,505620,2013/8/24,5,Delicious!  Just the right amount of spice in addition to the freshness of the garlic and lemon juice.  DH loved them as well.  So easy to make -- just need your own version of  ras el hanout which I found here on the website.  Will definitely make these potatoes again very soon.  Made for ZWT9.
482376,505620,2013/8/27,5,"We loved these potatoes. Great flavor without being overwhelming. I was shorter on time, so I quartered my potatoes for faster cooking. I used a homemade ras el hanout. I wasn&#039;t sure how much olive oil to use, so decided on approx 2 T which worked well. Made for Famly Picks ZWT9 for the Soup-A-Stars team"
1680722,505620,2013/11/18,5,"Prepared this as side dish for dinner.&lt;br/&gt;I used small unpeeled young potatoes (preecooked as described) and I added to the recipe 1 zucchini diced (same size as potatoes). &lt;br/&gt;Precooking the potatoes is very important: in this was the potatoes were really through, the skin dud not burn and we fully enjoyed the the full flawor of the spices.&lt;br/&gt;I used a wide tray, in order to let evaporate the juice of the zucchini.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this recipe, we really this dish very much!"
47892,505620,2013/12/12,5,Very delicious! I used a homemade ras el hanout and served the potatoes with Mirj&#039;s cumin meatballs and a simple side salad. We were low on provisions due to snow but luckily I had plenty of potatoes on hand! This would be yummy for breakfast with a dollop of yogurt! Made for Recipe Swap #83 in Australian forum.
169430,505620,2013/12/17,5,Total yum factor here. I had breakfast for lunch yesterday and these potatoes were the high point by a mile. The humble turkey bacon and egg were honored to be on the same plate with this delicious &quot;side&quot; dish. It&#039;s a star.
128473,505620,2014/2/20,5,"Great recipe Bethie.  Thank you so much for sharing this lovely recipe.  We really enjoyed this tasty dish.  My oven tends to run hot, so everything turns out darker and a little crisper.  That didn&#039;t effect these tasty potatoes in anyway.   Made for Best of 2013 Tag Game."

2001564337,505180,2017/6/1,0,"I made this when I was on vacation in Fl. this past week. First of all, that is WAY too much sugar! We used about 1.5c of sugar, and it was great! We used it on ice cream, and we did ribs on the grill, tasted wonderful!"
2001077664,505180,2017/6/11,4,"Too much lemon juice. Next time I will cut it in half, or even less,"

471300,494388,2013/3/17,5,"This is good and a perfect dish for a cold winter&#039;s day like today.  My DH thought it was very similar to chicken fricass&eacute;e, and I think he is right with the flavour but the quinoa and cheese make it more solid like a traditional casserole.  You don&#039;t really taste the quinoa much but I think that is good thing because the other flavours are really great.  The only thing that I changed was to make a substitute for the Condensed Cream Of Mushroom Soup because the locals don&#039;t seem to eat it and I don&#039;t like paying ?2.30 for something I can make for myself in less than 10 minutes that costs less than a 1/4 of that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is so good that we almost finished the whole thing with the two of us in one sitting and I am sure it wouldn&#039;t make it until tomorrow.  I wanted to try this one because we always have quinoa around because my DH makes a recipe with it, but you don&#039;t need much for it, so I wanted to use more of it up.  We will be doing it again for sure.  Thanks!  Made for PAC Spring 2013."

169430,507926,2014/8/13,5,"As I only had a small apple for breakfast this morning I decided to spoil myself and also do the Onion Challenge for Culinary Quest 2014 at the same time.  Lovely and very tasty dish that was filling without overloading. I had a slice of whole grain toast, orange juice and,yes, I had a slice of onion with this!"
1770404,511274,2014/11/19,5,"These were sooooo good; very rich.  They are even better the next day.  I didn&#039;t follow the recipe exactly, I thought 4 lbs of mushrooms was too much for my needs, so I only used 3 - 6oz pkgs. I wish I would have done the 4 lbs, I could have eaten them all myself!  I did these in the crockpot and cut the wine down to 2 cups. Otherwise I did everything as instructed, Day one I used them as appetizers, with the crusty bread.  The left-overs I put over steak (I marinated the steaks in some of the liquid also) and it was wonderful!  I used an inexpensive  pinot noir since this is what I found on the internet about burgundy wine &quot;The only grapes used in fine Burgundy are pinot noir and gamay (red), and chardonnay (white)&quot;"
461834,517592,2014/9/21,5,"Excellent bean recipe!!!  I made this as written except I didn&#039;t have the listed &quot;Fiesta&quot; brand of seasoning here in FL.  I used a combination of Lawry&#039;s Seasoned Salt, Paula Deen&#039;s Seasoning and extra black pepper.  Served this with some cornbread muffins for a wonderful lunch today!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for CQ 2014."
266635,517592,2018/11/14,5,"A great recipe for pinto beans without having to babysit them on the stove. I couldn't find my bean seasoning so I used a combination of the spices that were appropriate. I had a nice ham bone with plenty of ham that I used for this recipe. I generally add rotel to my beans, but instead stayed with the directions and the result was great."
37449,495413,2014/5/18,5,"I did quarter the recipe, replaced the squash with sweet potato and used black beans and this still turned out so good! I enjoyed the southwest seasoning and now have some  to use for other dishes. Thanks!"
1179225,495413,2014/8/19,5,"Delicious,healthy chili recipe. It looked like it would be more than it actually was. I had to add a little water to it, the flavor was a little too strong for us. That rarely happens, but was easily adjusted. Thanks for sharing the keeper recipe."
216999,503605,2013/7/16,4,"Very good!  I made half the recipe and baked it in a 8 x 8 inch square pan.  I had my doubts, as this was much thinner than other cake batters, there was no scraping it into the pan, it was more like pour it into the pan.  The baking time was right on.  The cake is very moist and the cognac is very nice with the spice, raisins and nuts.  Everyone loved it and we each had 2 pieces!  When I make this again, I will up the amount of spices and use less water.  Made for Pink Panthers on the Prowl for ZWT9."
315565,503605,2013/7/19,5,"This was a moist, dense and delicious cake. I blitzed up my fruit to make cake easier to cut as sometimes bigger fruit can cause the cake to tear. I upped the spice quantities and so the colour of the cake was wonderful as was the smell while it baked. Made for ZWT 9"
266635,504794,2013/11/13,5,"Great stirfry!  Delicious and easy to make in my electric wok.  I did trade out beef for the pork, used frozen peas and reduced the celery a little bit (just my preference);  Served over rice.  Will definitely whip this up again!  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
2309373,515567,2014/7/7,0,Very tasty. Service to me family tonight Everyone agreed that it had a lot of flavor. This is a keeper
67728,512982,2014/4/30,5,"Made this for lunch today -- loved it! I used roasted piquillo peppers in this, since I was out of regular roasted red peppers, and I used yellow onion in place of the red. I increased everything a bit, since my tortellini package was 24 oz instead of 16oz. My batch didn&#039;t come out quite as pretty as the original photo because I was rushing to get this done before work, but it&#039;s still an atttractive colorful dish that would be really nice at a potluck or summer BBQ. It&#039;s yummy, to boot -- can&#039;t go wrong with the pretty and delicious combo! I&#039;ll be keeping this recipe on hand for this summer. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"

126440,512982,2014/5/3,5,Great salad!  Loved all the ingredients together.  Didn&#039;t have cucumber so added chicken chunks.&lt;br/&gt;Loved the dressing.  Will make that one all the time.

228458,504405,2013/8/7,4,"These were a yummy treat! In flavor they reminded me remarkably of a donut, probably due to the nutmeg. I reduced the sugar a bit, to about a half cup, but did sprinkle some raw sugar on top. The kids thought they were a bit too crunchy, but I liked the texture. Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
39835,504405,2013/8/8,4,"Very good and easy - we used a mixed berry mix from Trader Joe&#039;s and didn&#039;t use the healthier options but used regular sugar, butter and regular skim milk. Made for ZWT9. Thanks for sharing!"
242729,512497,2014/2/25,4,"What a fabulous recipe Paula! We loved this and enjoyed this cornbread with eggs and bacon, as   well as hot black coffee this morning for brunch! I used authentic Pioneer Cornmeal, and also used bacon drippings in place of the shortening for extra flavour. The cornbread was fluffy with a nice crumb. I asked DH to rate it for me, and he gave it a FAB 4 for flavour and taste, but thought it was a wee bit dry, so next time I may add a little more bacon drippings or shortening to the mixture for the perfect cornbread! We BOTH loved it and I have saved this recipe to make again when I cook chilli! Made for Aussie recipe swap #85, thanks for sharing this recipe Paula! Karen/FT"

2549237,493709,2013/7/12,5,"We really liked this chili.  I doubled the meat, onions, and beans.  I also took your suggestion of adding in green bell peppers and threw in some frozen corn that needed used up.  We don&#039;t like our chili &quot;soupy&quot; as you stated it is in the description, so I didn&#039;t double the tomatoes or tomato juice.  This is a very versatile chili, that I am sure we will enjoy many times in the fall and winter.  Thank you for a winner IA gal.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup ~Jan-June 2013."
2000937685,494470,2016/3/24,4,"They were very good and moist, but more cakey than dense like scones. You definitely get more than 6, unless you want huge scones, and to bake for about 15 minutes"
1052873,517516,2014/8/9,4,"This was tasty. The bacon was a big plus. Soup with pickles is outside my norm. I had some trouble with the directions - what kind of sausage? - I went with regular pork sausage. What kind of pickles and how big - around here, pickles are everything from the cucumbers that are the right size to make pickles from, sweet, bread and butter, dill, hot sweet, etc. I chose 3 large dill spears. Tomato puree? I had a bunch of fresh tomatoes on the counter so I threw them in the food processor. Fresh herbs? Nothing I had seemed appropriate. I seasoned with some celery salt and pepper. Turned out pretty good. Made for CG 14."
1803505179,511449,2014/12/15,5,"super easy! this for a holiday party, and it was gone in minutes. only thing i changed was to use smoked paprika and pepper with water instead of the regular paprika and pepper with liquid smoke. assume that smoked paprika wasn&#039;t as readily available in the 70s. anyway it tasted like just like deli pastrami only it was very moist (wife says &quot;juicy&quot;)."
2574795,518773,2017/3/24,4,"We are not huge Salisbury steak fans but occasionally have a taste for them, especially with an excellent gravy. Only change was seasoned instead of plain bread crumbs. Used portobello mushrooms....more is better. Very good over noodles."
2000205005,511449,2015/5/15,5,Amazingly easy and delicious. Followed the recipe and it came out perfect. First time making it and I didnt expect it to come out better than I&#039;ve ever had.

2001448261,495057,2017/3/21,0,Can you substitute Sprite for Brandy?
2002257691,536834,2018/9/1,4,Good basic recipe. Addition of brown sugar was nice touch. I added mex oregano to give herb flavor. Sauce was tight. Simple but effective
169430,503827,2013/10/15,5,"I used this recipe for our Thanksgiving dessert yesterday (Canadian Thanksgiving) and 3 of us wiped it out before bedtime. In order to lower added sugar as much as possible it used 1/3 cup of Splenda Brown in the fruit and Splenda granular in the topping. Used gorgeous crisp and perfect Gala apples and added 1 rounded tsp of cinnamon, 3/4 tsp of ginger paste to the fruit. The liquid was 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. It earned top marks all around. I might add that for myself I would use half the amount of raisins next time only because they are such concentrated little bundles of sugar. Believe me there were no complaints at all with the full amount, lol. The recipe works beautifully. :D"
37449,503827,2013/11/12,5,"I had just made some apple pie filling so used that, added raisins in and proceeded with the topping  which was delicious! I scaled this down for two and ate it all by myself. Thanks!"
280271,503827,2014/3/2,4,I made this for the hubby...I cut it in thirds...so he got 1 1/2 servings...he said it was overly sweet...and had a tad to many raisins in it...but he ate the whole thing with whipped cream on top...go figure...thanks for posting it...next time I&#039;ll cut back on the sweetness and the raisins...=)
2704678,495815,2013/2/21,5,This is delicious and easy to make! My family loved it and I will be making this soup often!
39835,506652,2013/12/12,4,"Very good dessert which we enjoyed. I never used nutella before, but it was really good on this cake. Thanks for sharing!"
482933,495992,2014/5/22,5,"Lived up to my expectations--loved it!  Drizzled over TJ&#039;s harvest blend grains, roasted carrots and chicken breasts for a great meal. Thank you for sharing."
37449,507497,2013/10/20,5,"I love goat cheese, and with the black pepper, this was delish! Served with sunchips. Thanks!"
542159,507497,2014/7/4,5,"This was so rich, creamy and good that it felt very decadent even though it was really simple. I served with French bread and recipe #482047 for a nice light summer lunch. Thanks for the post."
679953,507497,2014/12/4,5,Very nice and easy..  Still having my share.. great hockey snack.  Made for FYC Tag.  Goes real great with Triscuits.
740247,499772,2014/4/29,5,This could not have been easier!  I made it with a cut-up fryer &amp; put it on low for 5-6 hours.  It was delicious.  I will be making this again.  &lt;br/&gt;Made for Spring PAC 2014
2609375,499772,2014/3/14,5,"Delicious!  Ours just fell apart, was tender and moist.  Served with potato patties (made from leftover mashed potatoes) and braised greens.  When we make this, we use the stock as a light gravy at another meal.  Strain, refrigerate it, remove most of the fat, heat in a saucepan as a &quot;jus&quot; or if you&#039;re cooking potatoes, add some of the starchy potato water to slightly thicken.  Delicious on mashed potatoes and leftover chicken. I&#039;ve made this recipe with chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken and it was great!  I&#039;ve also used 1/2 thyme and 1/2 crushed dried rosemary, which I love, and that was a good combo we&#039;ll do again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hint...use onion and add some potatoes and perhaps carrots in the bottom of your crockpot to elevate the chicken higher, last time we used a whole chicken, it kind of sunk into the gathering broth, was great tho!.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This recipe is a definite keeper.  In our house, if a recipe gets taped inside the cabinet door, it&#039;s in our hall of fame...I added this one the very first time I made it.  So, so good."
2860225,493253,2013/6/12,5,"The poster needs a lesson or two in grammar and spelling, but the recipe needs no help at all. It worked great! I made a half-batch, and will make another half-batch later on this week. Scrumptious!"
128473,510223,2017/2/27,5,"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe. It is terrific, quick and easy to make with wonderful results. The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender and delicious. Thank you for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy often. Made for What's on the Menu? tag game."
254614,497424,2013/3/16,5,"This was comfort food, yumm! I used beef stew meat, cut in small pieces. I used browned flour which I have on hand. This added richness to the gravy. I did spray the deep frying pan with Pam. I tried without and meat stuck. I added a  few drops of steak sauce to the gravy.&lt;br/&gt;The submitted recipe is basic and that is what I like about it, it stands alone..delicious..but if you want to ramp it up you can with many additions to either the potatoes or gravy."
80353,500485,2013/8/4,5,"I made a half-batch of these 3 days ago and broken them open to accompany lunch today.  They are crisp, flavourful and delicious.  Great pickle."
539686,500485,2013/8/8,5,Love anything pickled and these are easy. I used a one pound bag of baby carrots and it worked just fine. Made for ZWT #9.
251917,506869,2013/9/30,5,Aussie swap #80: These mini quiches were outstanding!! I made using frozen spinach and they were delicious and perfectly portioned for us! Will definitely make again!
2001845623,534270,2017/12/8,5,More rum?
2002084386,516658,2018/3/30,0,"I made these krispies treats for Easter for my grandson Harry. I think to be honest we all had a taste, and they were delicious."
143318,536066,2018/7/17,5,This is a fast weeknight meal that will help clean out your refrigerator! I used kohlrabi &quot;noodles&quot; which worked great. I loved the creaminess of the melted cheese in it (I used vegan chive cream cheese).
2000653870,533358,2017/9/2,3,This might be better with a different dressing. Maybe a tomato based vinaigrette.
2734669,509555,2013/12/3,4,"My wife and I made this on the weekend. We followed the instructions, but could not figure out all the changes at the end after 4. The only thing that we changed was using 1 1/2 cups of milk. This was good, but something didn&#039;t seem right. We will try this again with our own adjustments."
107583,512798,2014/4/26,5,This is a great way to cook tilapia.  Lots of flavor and easy.  Made a great &quot;fish n&#039; chips&quot; with sweet potato fries.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC.
1803074902,518208,2014/8/26,5,Ha! You entered them...good for you.
1803075004,518208,2014/8/26,5,Pool party all the way
1803075044,518208,2014/9/2,5,These came out great!
2211242,518208,2014/9/11,5,oh boy what is not to like
42602674,518208,2014/9/11,0,oh my goodness!!
1803126231,518208,2014/9/11,5,luv the crunch
1803131855,518208,2014/9/13,0,Can&#039;r eat just one
1803131938,518208,2014/9/13,5,Aaaaa A-1 AMAZING!
1803101168,518208,2014/9/13,5,Please publish this review....these are so crispy!
1803132665,518208,2014/9/14,5,The b-day egg rolls surface to stardom!!!!!!!!!
1803137263,518208,2014/9/15,5,very flavorful!!!
1803137291,518208,2014/9/15,5,We will make these again and again!
169430,497346,2013/4/19,5,Yummy. I had this for dinner tonight along with a slaw salad. It&#039;s sure quick to make and it reminded me of a restaurant style sanny. I would certainly make this again.
2002118956,536836,2018/9/15,0,I would love to see a picture of the finished cake! It is always nice to see the finished product with the recipe.
1271506,507249,2013/10/16,5,"These are wonderful!  A friend gave me some rather large cucumbers, so I cut them into spears rather than leaving them whole; otherwise, I followed the recipe.  What a marvelous earthy flavor and so easy to prepare!  I&#039;m thinking that brine would be marvelous with carrots -- hoping to try that next.  Thanks so much for posting."
323186,503955,2013/7/17,5,"Dont be put off by what looks like a lot of ingredients, this comes together quickly and is absolutely delicious!   I scaled the recipe down for 2, and I might add that I particularly enjoyed the celery seed in this.  Lacking soda crackers, I used cheese flavoured potato chips, which made a very nice topping.   next time I wont scale it down, we finished it and I would have really enjoyed leftovers!   Thank you Dienia, made for ZWT 9"
480195,503955,2013/7/23,5,"This was easy to make. I followed the recipe as.given, using a medium cheddar cheese. DH and I loved it and I will be making it again soon. Thanks for sharing a good recipe!"
620827,499333,2017/6/11,0,"I will be trying this tonight. We spent a week in NOLA and I have to agree, the BBQ shrimp was not all that good. I also dont like unpeeled shrimp cooked any way. My bride was determined to have BBQ shrimp. She no longer is so determined. This recipe sounds much better. Will report back manana'"
286566,505659,2013/8/25,5,"I made 4 of these delicious eggs for the DH and I - I baked at 175C fan forced and the eggs were cooked in 17 minutes with firm yolks and cooked whites, thank you Chef #362453, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
716061,505659,2014/2/1,0,"Recently tried this - delicious!!!! I did not have regular eggs, I did have liquid eggs, tried it, baked it for 30 to 40 minutes - looked and tasted like custard - next time I will take a photo."
1706426,505693,2013/8/12,5,"Loved this recipe, the spices reminded me of Christmas. Thanks for dreaming this delicious drink up. Made for ZWT9 express round."
1802805003,516315,2014/6/7,5,amazing! I love how the meled cheese meshes with the chicken
47892,495093,2013/3/22,5,"Yummy and hit the spot! Although brown rice is healthier, white rice is more traditional and gives better contrast but there&#039;s no need for a star deduction. Easy, economical, very healthy, tasty. Served with a simple mixed green salad to make the meal complete. Made for NA*ME tag/March."
266635,495093,2013/9/20,5,"This dish is heaven!  It may take some time to make, but it&#039;s worth every minute spent.  Actually, if your organized with this dish, you can cook the onions, brown rice and lentils all at the same time.  Then it&#039;s only a matter of combining ingredients and then devouring it.  Sooo good!  This dish is going into my Best of 2013.  Served this with recipe#501086.  Made for the NA/ME tag, September, 2013."
2324285,495093,2014/3/12,5,"This is an awesome vegetarian meal.  The caramelized onions are really the only topping you need, but I did also serve it with yogurt and chutney.  I cooked all three components at the same time, so everything came together rather quickly.  It was filling and perfectly seasoned."
1179225,495093,2017/12/1,5,Yum! I really liked this rec but my husband was a little cool on it. I think it was the cinnamon that threw him off. I'm looking forward to the leftovers. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
228458,505693,2013/8/12,5,"A perfect afternoon pick-me-up :). The spices were more subtle than I thought they were going to be, but still packed a lot of flavor. I had an unfortunate lack of whipped cream in the house, so I had to *settle* for a caramel drizzle instead. Sigh. Life is just rough sometimes (LOL). Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
1925885,505693,2013/8/12,5,"Yummy!  I questioned the amount of the seasonings, but it was absolutely perfect!  However, this makes two LARGE servings!  After the (bad) picture taking, I drizzled a little more Tia Maria over the whipped cream to get over it, and...heaven!!!  Thanks for this wonderful creation!  Made for team Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
242766,505693,2013/8/13,5,"Delicious!!  I had this for dessert after lunch today and thought that it was heavenly.  Loved the spices in this, I thought they were perfect.  I used Kahlua and French vanilla ice cream and my coffee had a little bit of hazelnut in it.  I am seriously contemplating having another.  Great job on your team coffee creation...it&#039;s a keeper!!  Made for ZWT 9 Caribbean Express Round for The Apron String Travelers"
80353,505693,2013/9/5,5,What a treat!  I LOVED the spices in this.  Great creation.
67728,505693,2013/9/10,5,"I really liked the spices in this! I used Kahlua and coffee ice cream in this (what I had), and I whipped a little bit of cream for this myself. I only made a half-recipe because I didn&#039;t have quite as much brewed coffee as I thought, but it was a good amount for one serving (one latte mug full). Thanks for posting!"
2002187583,535312,2018/6/16,0,I have an oven mess. The sheet pan too small for all that mix.
212609,514038,2014/3/25,5,"Everybody should be able to make a b&eacute;chamel sauce from scratch, as it&#039;s a basis from where so many marvellous dishes start out.&lt;br/&gt;I strongly recommend that you do heat the milk, as it makes it easier to incorporate into the roux ( the flour and butter combo). I also recommend the use of the bay leaf, and if you want to do it like the pro&#039;s, you should heat the milk with a bay leaf studded to a small onion with a clove...it really does make a difference.&lt;br/&gt;I didn&#039;t like the inclusion of the paprika, and in a classic b&eacute;chamel it has no place...sorry Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;As Rosie suggests, you can replace the milk with hot chicken stock, making it a veloute, which is great for chicken pies and suchlike.&lt;br/&gt;I added cheese to my b&eacute;chamel and turned it into a beautiful soft silky cheese sauce, which I tossed some pasta through-just delicious!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
653438,514038,2014/4/30,5,Made this to go with your recipe#514039#514039 and it made a delicious gravy/sauce for the recipe.  Easy and delicious.  Thank you for posting.
1706426,505768,2013/8/15,5,"Couldn&#039;t be simpler! I did add a dash of salt to the steaming water though, personal preference.  Thanks for sharing, made for ZWT9"
2597942,505768,2013/8/17,5,This could not have been any easier. I used fresh corn husks (since I have corn on the cob for tomorrow&#039;s dinner sitting on my counter). I used my 3 tiered bamboo steamer to make this dish. I served this with Recipe #406829. Hubby mixed his pork into the rice. They went well together. We enjoyed it very much. Thank you for posting your recipe. (Made for ZWT9)
284897,505768,2013/8/19,5,"I used the shortcut method, and it was great!&lt;br/&gt;Easy with a fantastic outcome, which we all loved.&lt;br/&gt;Would not change a thing!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Jostlori."
80353,505768,2013/8/26,5,"Fool-proof really.  Like the twisted one, I added some salt to the water as that&#039;s just the way I do it (and it does improve the flavour, I think).  Thanks Lori."
67728,505768,2013/8/26,5,"Super-simple to make, and perfect as-is used in Recipe#505837 (would probably add a bit of salt if I was planning to use it as a side dish for something savory). I was occupied with some other cooking for the day, so I started soaking this early enough that it would be ready for that night, which worked out perfectly for me. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9."
37449,511690,2014/1/16,5,Easy and delicious! My first time mixing the mashed yolk with the mayonnaise. Thanks!
204024,511690,2014/4/7,5,Great flavors in this potato salad.   Loved the green onions.  This went great with our pulled pork sandwiches for dinner.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
305531,511690,2015/1/29,5,Nice potato salad. It was easy to make and loved the taste. I did add a stalk of celery since I had one that I needed to use up. Thanks for sharing. Made for Best of 2014 tag.
280271,511690,2015/1/31,5,This brings back memories...just like Mom made except the mashing of the yolk mixture...thanks for a nice reminder of the comforts of home...made for the Best of 2014 tag game...
39835,493762,2013/2/14,5,"This is great! I did make some changes by skipped the allspice (out of) and instead of two potatoes - used one regular potato and 1 sweet potato, black beans instead of kidney beans and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. So and open to adaptations! Thanks for sharing!"
2002169954,533281,2018/6/1,5,Made these for my co-workers and one of them especially enjoyed saying &quot; it's my three favorite things!&quot;
2001102678,534283,2018/1/3,5,l love corn
37449,511697,2014/4/1,5,"Just delicious! This hit the spot for me for a mid afternoon treat. Light but filling and so flavorful with the molasses, ginger and cinnamon."
1179225,511697,2014/4/3,5,Great recipe! Not too sweet and just the right amount of flavor. I&#039;ll be making this again. Thanks for posting the recipe.
266635,511697,2014/12/4,5,"The flavors in this smoothie are ones that you might expect in a warm drink, but they are quite good in this smoothie as well.  The addition of the banana is an interesting touch and is very tasty.  I did not have any organic 2% milk so I used almond vanilla milk instead.  I have plenty of frozen bananas in the freezer so we&#039;ll definitely make this drink again. : )  Made for the Sweet December tag game."
1072593,511697,2015/3/25,5,"A real splurge!  And after all, it&#039;s March and my goal of exercise
avoidance and no weight loss for the new year is right.  So far I&#039;m at 100%."
131126,495306,2013/3/2,3,"The salad is colorful which makes for a pretty presentation. I elected to not add the heated sauce to the slaw. I let it cool and then added for the two hours.  The flavor fresh made was very tart and different. I thought it might be interesting to try it on a sauerkraut salad or even to marinate  beets.  The next day the slaw looked fine, but was lackluster; missing the tart flavors that had made it special to me.  Served with baked pork chops and a contest corn on the cob.  Good luck!"
1706426,495306,2013/3/3,3,"We didn't care for this, it was too vinegary, needed salt and had too much oil. I let the dressing cool in the fridge before tossing with the veg. . It could use more celery seed as well. It has promise though, especially for outside picnics in the summer, great crunch! Thanks for posting, made for Dining on a Dollar 2013"
1052873,495306,2015/10/3,5,This was a little bland but I used it in Bahn Mi duck confit sliders and it was the perfect condiment.
2001868370,499595,2017/12/22,5,"Thank you for posting this. Trader Joe's has something else on the back of their cocoa powder now. I was a faithful follower of the chocolate lovers cake on the back of Hershey's cocoa powder, but this is even better. This is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever had/made. I have eaten a lot of chocolate cake and experimented with many. I must admit that for me, the key to a good cake is a good buttercream or cream cheese frosting. This cake is good enough to eat without frosting. (But why would you do that?) It does make a lot of cake and it rises a lot. I usually make a 3 layer cake from the one recipe. 9 inch rounds, and a little thin. But like I said, it rises a lot."
240804,498992,2015/12/14,5,"I was surprised that no one had reviewed this yet. It is very moist and flavorful. I am always looking for eggless quick breads, so this suited me fine. I did add some flaxseed mixed with water and one extra teaspoon of baking powder to help with raising. I also added another quarter cup of flour since I added more cherries and the batter seemed a bit too thin. This has a great taste!"
143721,503429,2013/7/16,4,Not a bad spice mix.  Wished it had a bit more kick.  Next time I might add more cayenne.  Made for ZWT 9 and The Apron String Travelers.
163112,503429,2013/7/25,5,"Tasty stuff!  I used this in recipe#502440 tonight.  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers!"
67728,515288,2014/5/12,5,"I really enjoyed these! I&#039;m always trying to find new and different ways to get more quinoa in our diets, and this fit the bill perfectly. Through some trial and error, I found that the cakes were less likely to fall apart when flipping them if they were cooked for longer than 4 minutes on the first side. I also recommend using a spatula with a very thin edge to it to properly lift the crust off the pan (they stuck a tiny bit). They are equally tasty warm and at room temp, which is nice, because then you don&#039;t have to worry about keeping the first batch hot while you fry the next batch. I think these would be a really nice cocktail party nibble if they were made tiny (maybe using 1/8 cup measure to form them rather than the 1/2 cup measure. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
2001900605,530677,2017/12/30,5,I chose this recipe from google when I wanted to make eggs in my instant pot because it had the clearest instructions. It turned out great - yolks were more cooked but I used smaller eggs - I'm guessing you used extra large? I think size is key with boiling eggs when it comes to slight cooked-ness variations. I also left them in the water longer because I ended up getting busy and ate them cold but they peeled perfectly - thanks for the tip about cracking the end!
1802625955,530677,2018/1/31,0,I followed the instructions to a T and the yolks were completely done.

309630,502284,2013/9/11,4,This was simple to make and very tasty.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and had enough to share  at the office the next day.  I am not a big fan of Tarragon but it worked well .  I think I will try this using fresh parsley and thyme.  Made for your win Football Pool Week 1 2013.  Thanks for sharing.
91584,511886,2014/11/2,5,Wonderful recipe that used to be on the back of the flour package years ago. Only change was I use crisco for the butter amount and increase to 3 tablespoons. This recipe never ceases to garner praise from all who try it- thanks so much for posting!
2739662,497021,2013/3/16,5,awesome recipe!!

2823603,515060,2014/4/26,5,I tried theses cookies looking for a healthy snack or a healthy quick breakfast option.  They are delicious I loved the texture and wholesomeness felt more like eating an energy bar.  Would make a great after school snack or a quick on the run breakfast.  Loved the recipe!

242766,509714,2014/10/6,5,"What&#039;s not to love about a float that has coffee and chocolate flavors in it?  This was delicious!  I used club soda and added an extra scoop of ice cream and a little extra chocolate syrup...yum!!  Of course I had to add the whipped cream on top, too :)  Thank you for sharing this wonderful drink...it is definitely a keeper! **Made for 2014 Football Pool**"

236262,494236,2013/12/3,5,Wonderful recipe. I made everything as directed except that I substituted zucchini for the olives and shredded the carrots. Just my personal taste. The dish turned out beautiful and delicious.
199848,509630,2013/11/25,5,"Definitely better than take-out!   Of course, you have to use a good-quality chicken stock/broth.  The texture was just perfect.  I only used about 1 tsp of soy sauce and I added some extra scallions.  This is so easy to make with only a few simple ingredients.  The recipe instructions were excellent.  Thanx for posting!"
226863,509630,2013/11/27,5,I used homemade stock and due to some stomach issues I left out the scallions.  Love egg-drop soup and this version is delicious!!  A perfect recipe for a quick lunch or dinner.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Made for PRMR tag game.
8629,509630,2013/11/30,5,I really liked the flavor of this egg drop soup.  I followed the recipe but also added a handful of frozen peas into the boiling broth.
212609,509630,2014/1/8,5,"Quick, simple and quite delicious.......so much so, that after my 7 year old DD tried some, she abandoned her own meal, and hijacked my bowl of it!&lt;br/&gt;I love this simplicity of this, and the versatility too, as I know that some cooked shredded chicken, and some sweetcorn ( even creamed corn) would just be fantastic in this.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Rosie, for a wonderful recipe.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
296809,509630,2014/2/2,5,"Made for your Football Pool win - This is a good, basic &amp; tasty recipe for the classic egg drop soup prototype. It is also both ingredient &amp; prep-friendly. While I clearly didn&#039;t hold it against the recipe &amp; for us at least, it begged to be expanded &amp; the fact that was so easily done is another reason to recommend it. I added snow peas, mushrooms &amp; baby shrimp for added color, texture &amp; protein (chicken works easily too). It was served w/a mixed veggie stir-fry combined w/ramen type noodles. Congrats on your FP win &amp; thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
266635,509630,2014/3/7,5,"This soup is really tasty and sooo easy to make so I will definitely be making it again.  I sauteed some mushrooms and added them to the soup along with the scallions.  I also added two extra teaspoons of soy sauce to the broth -- just our preference.  This made a really nice, light soup for lunch.  Made for PRMR, March, 2014."
653438,509630,2014/4/17,5,"I love soup and this was right on!  So very tasty and easy.  I used homemade chicken broth and added a few more scallions than called for.  Served with recipe#210937#210937 and recipe#450315#450315. Next time I make this (and I definately will) I will add some mushrooms (slivered), snow peas, and shrimp like twissis suggested for a perfect lunch/dinner.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
542159,509630,2014/9/3,5,"So simple yet so good, I was able to cut this down to a very satisfying dinner for one. Might try adding just a very tiny bit of ginger.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for the post."
1680722,509630,2014/9/4,5,"This was my quick lunch today! I really appreciate this tasty recipe as it&#039;s a filling and light recipe. &lt;br/&gt;Thanks  a lot for this super easy, deliciious soup!"

107135,503679,2013/8/21,5,"wow this is good if you like sub sandwiches , you should look at this recipe  .used beef salami zwt9"
179133,503679,2014/4/19,5,"I halved the recipe since I was making for just myself and didn&#039;t want a ton leftover. Used mini farfalle instead of rotini (what I had on hand). Used the full amts of salami (cubed) and edam, half a bell pepper, full amt of corn, about 2 Tbsp olives, and also added half a can of artichoke hearts (chopped) and a few Tbsp homemade pickled green tomatoes (diced). Used shallot in the dressing and white wine vinegar. Really delicious. Love the za&#039;atar in the dressing. Thanks for sharing!"
560491,500465,2013/6/4,4,"These were tasty chops!  Made with a red onion since I discovered too late to go to the store that I was out of shallots.  I should have reduced the sauce down a little more since it was still a little thin, but it had a nice flavor.  Made for Photo Tag."
2000966280,513141,2016/4/10,5,Hats off to Jane from Ohio!! An original recipe for a classic meal!
468351,497150,2013/11/9,5,"Quaker has changed their oatmeal cookie recipe over the years, which all have been pretty good!  I like this one!  It is a keeper. It is simple, delicious, and most importantly to DHs liking.  :) The only change I made was; instead of using all butter in the recipe, the full 7/8s cup of butter, I used &frac12; cup unsalted butter (1 stick) plus 6 tablespoons of buttered flavored Crisco.  A perfectly delicious cookie!"
2001937487,529286,2018/1/17,0,Can I use chicken tenderloins instead of breast? If so how should I tweak the time?

305531,506903,2014/4/29,5,We love broccoli and I&#039;m always looking for a new way to cook it. This was a simple recipe that made some yummy broccoli. Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
1365025,493172,2013/1/31,4,Easy to make and tasted good also. I think I would add just a little more sugar next time. Made for Please Review My Recipe.
1800250658,509097,2013/11/14,5,This recipe turned out great an with precise timing.&lt;br/&gt;An the cookie sheet works well as stated .
2000682627,509097,2015/11/16,5,I made this dish just last night and I have a very picky fianc&eacute; and he LOVED it! I didnt put onion in it but I used chicken breast and cut them in half. Wrapped it with bacon and put the toothpicks on them to keep the bacon in place. I did have to drain the water out of the pans because it wasn&#039;t cooking browning much. I just took it out and drained it and put it back in. I flipped it over and let it cook about 15 more minutes and then sprinkled mild cheddar cheese on it and it was delicious!! Perfect recipe! Chicken was moist not dry and full of flavor! Not salty either very surprised! This is added to our cookbook!
1802849661,509097,2015/12/15,5,"Loved this dish! So easy to make and utterly delicious. I mean what could be better than chicken, bacon and cheese together?! We both loved this and will definitely be having it again!"
2000828529,509097,2016/1/20,5,Loved this ! Just finished eating this. But instead of onions I used crushed red peppers. Gave it a bit of spice and kick. Definitely will be making this again. My boys asked for seconds !!
2000876432,509097,2016/2/15,5,"I love this recipe, fix it quite often, very very delicious"
37449,508411,2014/1/30,4,I halve the recipe and didn&#039;t have quite enough broccoli so used a little cauliflower. Very nice and enjoyed. Thanks!
2324285,495906,2013/4/1,4,Pretty good and easy to make.  I think I&#039;d prefer to puree the sauce next time.

632249,508110,2014/4/23,3,"I&#039;m sorry for the low rating, but these cookies were not well received at my house.  I love pumpkin so I thought these would be great but somehow the pumpkin tasted strange to me. I don&#039;t know if it is because the cookies are raw so the pumpkin flavour seemed strong.  They are certainly easy to prepare I guess they just weren&#039;t to our taste.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
2000160550,508110,2015/4/23,5,I love these cookies. Very healthy ingredients and no sugar! I also add some chopped walnuts or coconut sometimes. I am not a breakfast eater so I pop one or two of these in my mouth and call it breakfast. N
383346,495851,2013/5/7,5,"This is very easy to do, just a few ingredients.  I used the relish.  My son liked it a lot.  It&#039;s great with the apple.  Thanks Elizabeth :)  Made for Photo tag game"
2001998984,530713,2018/2/18,0,"I have made these for at least 35 years. I stick to the recipe, but use only about 2oz of chocolate chips. Otherwise there is just too much chocolate (if there even is such a thing!)."
2000747025,507121,2015/12/14,5,This was delicious! 4 children and they all devoured it. So easy too. Trying it with thighs tonight.
1287956,516241,2014/6/2,5,"Made this tonight, and the combination of the rub and the cilantro-butter was fantastic.  It made the steaks so juicy and tender, they could&#039;ve been cut with a butter knife.  Combined it with crash potatos, and it was a winner for our family.  Definitely a keeper when the only thing I want hot is our grill."
622244,494567,2014/3/27,5,"Thank you so much for posting this recipe! I have one from the 80&#039;s back from when I was in high school and worked at a small town restaurant. I haven&#039;t made them cuz I couldn&#039;t find the recipe till recently.  It was DOUBLE this recipe so I was trying to half it. I found your recipe and it is the measurements for half of my recipe and the same except that mine called for SHORTENING/CRISCO instead of butter. I used the shortening but I think if I used the butter they would be less bulky looking? Anyway, they tasted JUST like I remembered! : ) Made them with my 3 year old son and he loved them too! Thank you for helping to make sure these cookies live on for future generations! : ) Going try and post a photo. I think they should be flatter if I remember right?"
1620171,500397,2013/7/21,5,"This is amazing. I don&#039;t even like mushrooms and I enjoyed them in this. I had to use vermouth as I had no sherry and the flavour was sort of like marsala, very nice. Made for ZWT 9 for the Tasty Testers."
2001571166,531396,2017/6/6,5,Delicious. A great rainy day soup.
2002293648,531396,2018/10/9,0,"Turned out kinda bland, turns out we didn't add the pepper because it wasn't mentioned in the directions, whoops!"
144373,503789,2013/7/23,5,"This recipe is delicious, and even more flavorful the next day.  Love the salad with the dressing on it and the chicken. Thank You.  Made for ZWT-9, The Apron String Travelers"
323186,503789,2014/7/14,5,"Wow,  this was so good!!  I put the chicken in the marinade in the morning, to cook in the evening, I have to tell you I will do this regularly even to have the chicken with pasta,  what flavour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yum, to die for!     We very much enjoyed our dinner,   great served this way,   but the real winner for me was definitely marinading the chicken in this recipe!   Thanks, LifeIsGood,   great recipe, enjoyed for For Your Consideration tag game."
2324285,504237,2013/7/28,4,Good- one of the better pickled salads that I&#039;ve had.  Not too vinegary and just slightly sweet.  This salad would also pair well with a lot of things.
1680722,517909,2014/9/23,5,"I mixed the ingredients with a mortar, so that the smell of bay leaf could come out.&lt;br/&gt;I loved this sauce very much and I think it would be great to prepare a small batch in advance and let it infuse for a few weeks before enjoying it."
2688526,495166,2013/2/11,5,Very Nice.
487245,498233,2013/3/29,5,"One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had! All the flavors go perfectly together. It is pretty rich though, I couldn&#039;t make it every week lol."
286566,508537,2013/11/4,5,"I scaled back for 1lb of mince (I used very lean mince) and put in grated cheddar cheese instead of parmesan as my lot do not like parmesan though I love it.  Thank you nochlo, made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
212609,508537,2013/11/22,5,"You are so right....these are fabulous meatballs.&lt;br/&gt;I tried one straight from the pan, and  just couldn&#039;t stop popping them into my mouth from then on.......they were so delicious.&lt;br/&gt;Kids loved them too, and in order to stop me eating them all (and I think that I might have done, too!!) I had to throw the rest in the freezer.&lt;br/&gt;A complete winner!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
2549237,508537,2014/2/9,4,"I say these are a good meatball (***), the rest of the family agrees that they are fabulous (*****).  I personally didn&#039;t care for the oregano and thought that there was to much pepper.  With a little tweaking I think I would really love these too.  I made these for my brother&#039;s 26th birthday on 2/6/14.  Thank you for helping us celebrate my baby brother&#039;s special day nochlo.  Made for PRMR."
2000861655,513331,2017/8/13,4,Excellent recipe! Easy to make and everyone loved it. I am a big fan of Chickpeas and this was delicious
1072593,493271,2014/2/15,5,"Pizza history was made today.  This was by far the best and thinnest crust I&#039;ve made yet.  And to show off my pizza-making skills, I ate lots of slices."
1802537105,514104,2017/9/21,5,"I've never tasted Popeye's myself (as an ex-pat Kiwi living in WV), however my husband remembers it growing up and travelling with his family to Myrtle Beach. They'd stop at a Popeye's on the way there and on the way back. He says that this recipe I found tastes just the way he remembers it! We usually use it as a seasoning for chicken sandwiches, so the 'heat' is a bit muted against the greater amount of chicken. I sometimes bring it as popcorn chicken to work in a slow cooker so it can keep at a good temperature throughout the day - of course it only lasts a couple of hours!"
169430,502928,2014/2/21,5,This is a great carrot salad and carrot salad&#039;s are one of my favorite things so YAY! It&#039;s Feb in the frozen North so I had to use dried mint but am looking forward to the arrival of warmer weather so that I&#039;ll be able to get fresh mint again. My single adjustment was to use Splenda in place of the honey because I&#039;m diabetic. Thanks much BK for sharing. :D
1680722,502928,2015/4/30,5,This was a refreshing tasty salad! I love carrots and I always have some on hand as I know that I can make delicious dishes with them. Oranges are a wonderful ingredient to be combined with carrots and the flavor of the spices really melted well with the other ingredients. Thanks a lot for posting this recipe.
266635,502928,2016/6/6,5,Made this delicious salad tonight -- loved the combination of flavors. Carrots are my favorite vegetable so it's nice to have another delicious recipe to add to my collection. I halved the recipe and it still made plenty.
482376,527487,2016/7/17,5,Yum! I loved the preparation and the outcome of this flavorful punch. I was also glad it made a pitcher so I will have leftovers. We all enjoyed our cocktails tonight. Thank you!
280271,514729,2014/4/9,5,Yummy salad and the dressing is packed full of heat...loved it! I did make a few subs...I used sweet onion...(I already had some chopped)...and instead of the black bean and corn salsa I used just a salsa...(I didn&#039;t have the other salsa)...but I bet that the bean and corn salsa would add even more colors to the plate...I omitted the parsley because I really don&#039;t care for it...just and FYI...make sure to read through the recipe...I almost didn&#039;t put in the water to thin the dressing...I think the dressing is the star of this dish...made for Spring 2014 PAC...=)
135470,493324,2013/9/3,3,"I enjoy rum, and all kinds of Collins drinks, but for me these flavors didn&#039;t go  well together. The rum is very potent  and after trying it as written I added a little lemon juice, blueberries, a dash of grapefruit bitters and more seltzer which made it more palatable, my DH thought it was ok before I doctored it. This was a good lesson for learning how different spirits mix with different base flavors. Made for ZWT 9 by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers."
2399085,504042,2013/8/17,5,"Made as directed!&lt;br/&gt;Loved it, it had great flavor. Next time I&#039;d change nothing. Very inexpensive meal! Thanks&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR!"
169430,504042,2015/5/23,5,"I made this last evening using 1 New York Strip steak that was in the freezer and, oh my, was it ever delicious! The flavors are magical in their ability to carry you to a warm evening on a palm tree filled island. Add a fruit salad, coconut bread and some rum punch and you have a very yummy vacation at home."
865936,504042,2015/7/13,5,"I thought this steak turned out fantastic.  I wound up marinating it for 2 days and it came out sort of sweet, but great!"
1802489674,504987,2014/4/5,5,I made this years ago and lost the recipe. I am so glad I saved it!  It is excellent! I hold off on the hot sauce and pepper and it is still very tasty!
128473,509870,2013/12/8,4,We enjoyed this tasty quick and easy to make dish very much.  It had nice flavor and great textures.  I followed your recipe exactly but I made the rice separate and poured everything over top of it. (personal preference only)  It was delicious served this way.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
2001469777,530316,2017/5/12,4,"beautiful, low carb healthy fat I think food should look as good as it tastes. kids like hole in one or sub bacon if not salmon eaters, easy. Brunch is the best meal of the day!"
2549024,506312,2013/9/1,5,We love this recipe and have made it twice in the last 10 days or so. Sometimes the broccoli needs to go just a little longer. It depends how roasted you like the broccoli. It&#039;s also good reheated quickly in the microwave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One tip - try to cut most of the stalk off as it gets woody. I buy the florets.
510718,506312,2014/4/6,5,"This recipe is SO, SO good and SO easy and fast!!  It has become a fast family favorite, even for our NON broccoli eaters!  I do try to remove most of the stalk as, as others have said, it can get woody.  If you use it, make sure to cut it into very thin slices.  My husband, who hates broccoli, says this recipe makes broccoli acceptable!  :D  Thank you so much for sharing!"
381180,506312,2014/4/20,5,"I loved this!  I used a little cayenne pepper instead of black pepper.  I really liked the crispness of the broccoli florets!  Tagged for Spring PAC 2014, and placed into my Best of 2014 cookbook!"
2000284529,506312,2015/6/21,1,I found after 27 minutes the broccoli was burned and not crispy at all. I used fresh broccoli. Was i not supposed to?
2001735535,527549,2017/9/30,5,This was so good. The pesto on bread was good too.
2001681399,519314,2017/8/21,5,I love this recipe thank you so very much for sharing!!! I will be making this more and more!!!
461834,494667,2013/3/7,5,"Yummy!!  Made this, scaled back for two servings, for our brunch today.  I added some of the green onion with the sausage(Jimmy Deans) and then I also added some diced red bell pepper.  Topped it with more green onion and served with biscuits and orange slices.  After the sausage and veggies were cooked, I add the egg/cheese mixture and cooked it for a min or two and then placed it in the oven for a few minutes and it was done perfectly.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
780172,494667,2013/9/28,5,Made a mini version of this and it was great. Used a sausage cut up left over from supper. Will make this again.
1802849661,494667,2016/3/16,5,"Oh my goodness, this is SO good! I served it with a fresh salad and it went down a storm. I don&#039;t know why I don&#039;t make frittata&#039;s more often because we love them! Also made a great lunch the next day!"
2001324015,494667,2017/3/25,5,"This turned out great, only had chicken sausage around (with feta and spinach), and worked perfectly after adding a bit of avocado oil for cooking the sausage with potato. Opted for baking this frittata in convection oven at 350&deg; for 1/2 hour; uniformly cooked and moist throughout."

47892,505800,2013/9/29,5,"I forgot to add the second egg but no problems to report! These were good! I used half lamb and half beef and made my own garbanzo bean flour. Fresh parsley and cilantro from our CSA box. Served with plain Persian rice, steamed carrots and a tossed salad. Made for NA*ME tag/September. Will make again!"
169430,505800,2013/10/26,5,I used this to make a humble burger but it tasted a lot better than that plain humble burger. I do believe that this mix would make one heck of a meatloaf. Very easy to make with things I usually have on hand. I served the burger with Recipe #463773 which isn&#039;t exactly Persian but they sure tasted good together.  :D
2324285,505800,2014/3/1,5,"These are yummy little meat patties that are not unlike kibbeh or koftas.  The amount of seasoning is perfect.  I served these with Greek yogurt that I mixed with fresh parsley and fresh cilantro, and the sauce was so good on the patties that I&#039;d say it&#039;s almost a required addition."
369715,494849,2013/5/10,3,I followed the recipe but needed to add more milk and added some pepper. I used cheddar cheese but we thought it needed more cheese. Mine cooked in 30 minutes.
632249,501410,2013/11/13,5,"Very yummy and so simple!  I had both vanilla pudding and banana pudding on hand so I added a tbsp of the banana pudding mix too just to give more banana flavour.  This would also be good with a few peanuts either in the base or sprinkled on top.  Rather than use all of the whipped cream, I just put a dollop on the pieces we were going to eat.  Made in honour of Pammyowl, you shall be missed!"
128473,501410,2013/11/17,5,"Wow, what a lovely rich, decadent dessert.  It was so quick and easy to make.  We enjoyed the flavors very much.  It was like a banana coconut cream pie.  Made in Memory of Pammyowl."
305531,501410,2013/11/18,5,This was so simple and yummy. I used a French vanilla pudding and we loved the results. Very good and can&#039;t wait to make this for the grandkids. Made in memory of Pammyowl.
2002309547,506058,2018/10/23,5,Super simple and easy to makes! One of my childhood favorite dishes.
266635,502661,2013/10/4,5,"Very tasty meatloaf.  We loved the horseradish in the sauce -- it really does give the sauce a &quot;kick&quot;!  I used a little larger pan than loaf size and used the Paula Deen trick of placing the meatloaf on top of two bread slices.  The bread soaks up any excess grease from the ground beef.  I could not find &quot;milk&quot; listed in the ingredient list so I added a tbsp. just to increase the moisture.  Made for PRMR, October, 2013."
128473,501511,2015/12/11,5,"Wow, was this good.  The dh was in flavor heaven.  Asked if we could have this again and again.  Made as written but I used Swiss Cheese Slices and Shredded Mozzarella and a spicy tomato sauce.  This was so delicious, so glad that I made 1/2 the recipe, we are having the rest tonight for dinner, yes it is that good.  Thanks for sharing Lazy... going into my keeper box.  Made for Holiday Hits 2015."
1800164758,503473,2013/10/28,3,"These ended up being more scone/biscuit- like than fluffy muffins...I think because the batter seemed a little thick and they&#039;re not very sweet.  They still have a really good flavor to them and are fairly soft in the middle.  Also, the orange didn&#039;t stand out as much as  I would have liked."
8532883,516283,2014/12/2,5,"I have made this numerous times over the years.  I vary it quite often, sometimes using boneless/skinless thighs, sometimes I add mushrooms, etc.  But no matter how many times I make this I am amazed at the wonderful yummy curry flavor that gets better with each day&#039;s left overs.  My husband is from India, and although this is not quite authentic, he enjoys it as much as I do.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this curry."
323186,516283,2015/3/4,5,"Other than cutting the chicken into chunks as we prefer it that way,  this is an excellent curry, dont be put off by the use of spices, most of them you will have in your pantry and it makes all the difference to make a curry properly, and not that much longer!!!   We loved this, and its even better the next day!   Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe, marramamba, made and enjoyed on a cold wet Saturday!   Made for Consideration Tag Game"
2002004272,519263,2018/2/21,5,"This soup is delish. I had slow cooked a pork butt in the crock pot and used the cooking liquid which cut down on the amount of chicken/beef stock needed. I did caramelize the cabbage and some onion then proceeded as written. A very good, healthy dinner! A little homemade beer bread on the side is a nice touch."
226863,499374,2013/5/12,5,Chocolate heaven!  So moist and spectacular tasting.  Easy as well. Both DS and I thought these are the best brownies we&#039;ve had in a long while!! Neighbors loved them too.  The only problem is the recipe just didn&#039;t make enough. LOL  A definite keeper!
50969,499374,2014/7/18,4,"This recipe was made on 7/17/14. Due to what was on hand a couple of changes were made. I didn&#039;t have bittersweet chocolate,so semi sweet was used. Didn&#039;t have the Dutch cocoa,so the same amount of Mexican cocoa powder was used.Other than those changes the recipe was made exactly as it was written. I don&#039;t know if using the Mexican cocoa made  any difference or not, but the cocoa taste was overpoweringly strong. The texture seemed slightly on the dense side,but still o.k.. &quot; Keep Smiling :) &quot;"
169430,501835,2013/6/20,5,I don&#039;t believe that I would have thought of using chili sauce on bread like this but it sure does work. This is delicious. I used it as part of a quick easy dinner tonight along with Recipe #302050. Great flavor.
1802998695,517166,2014/10/17,5,"I have made this numerous times, and it makes a lot.  If using raw rice, use 2 cans (14.5 oz.) of low-sodium beef broth.  The raw rice will  suck up the juice.  This is truly a comfort food, and tastes the same as the Rolled Cabbage Rolls."
2512893,517166,2014/10/22,5,The ultimate comfort food.  I made half the recipe and it would have been enough to serve 4 people. The only change I made was that I did not stir the raw cabbage into the hamburger mix.  I laid the chopped cabbage on top of the hamburger mixture and put the entire skillet in the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes.  The cabbage browned on the top and that made it soooo good.
1401145,517166,2014/10/27,5,"Great recipe!  I made one change...instead of the head of cabbage, I used a small bag of the pre-shredded and cleaned cole slaw mix.  Blended nicely and the cabbage taste was just perfect for me.  Also saved me prep time!"
1803361230,517166,2014/11/19,5,Great recipe! Even my young son who doesn&#039;t like cabbage tore it up!!! I would recommend adding a bit more seasoning. More like 2 TABLESPOONS of salt and 2-3 teaspoons of black pepper. Perhaps even a teaspoon or two of onion and/or garlic powder. Additionally 12-14 ounces of beef or vegetable broth would be nice as the dry rice consumes about all the juice and makes it a little gummy.
1803663715,517166,2015/1/15,0,"This recipe is wonderful. I used ground chicken and added olive oil when i browned it. i dont use the rice and used low sodium tomato products ( I am dieting and watching my sodium). It is delish!!!!!!!  Without the rice ( if i werent dieting) a big piece of hot buttery cornbread would pair wonderfully and make the perfect comfort food. This is an awesome spaghetti substitute if you are on a diet or watching calories. I make this over and over!!! Cheap, filling and wholesome! :)"
2000316651,517166,2015/7/4,0,I have made this over and over again in the past 2 years. I have made it like the original recipe states and I have done a few things to it also.  I like rice.....but I do not like rice with this dish.You can completely  leave it out if you wish. Its just a filler. It does take up allot of the juice if you do.  If you do use it..... use more tomato juice instead of water.  AKA one cup rice to 2 cups tomato juice. This is a tomato based meal.  Plain water will cut down on the taste more and more.  I have stopped using the rice all together.  It does need to be in there I do not think.  As for the ground beef.  I have used different types such as lean and then not so lean. The best to use on this meal is Ground Chuck.  I found this out the 5th time I made this. My family loves this. No matter how I might change it as long as I leave the rice out. LOL    I make sure the canned tomatoes are a good brand. My favorite is the Furmano&#039;s.  We all have our favorite brand and after trying this brand..... I will never go back to using anything else.  The cabbage does not matter of course.... just cook it until its tender.  As for the spices etc......  I do put more garlic it than it calls for. A teaspoon more pepper and a 1/2 more salt.........only if it needs more salt.  That is when you taste it as it cooks to determine if it does. Sometimes mine does some times it doesn&#039;t. Make sure you cut the cabbage up in bit sized pieces.    This is a great flavorful dish.  If you want the rice......try cooking it as a side item and pouring the meal over it.  Or even Noodles or someone mentioned mashed potatoes.  They all sound good to me.  I might try the mashed potatoes one day.  And I love eating this dish even more than the first day!    I have found if I have leftovers...... I can even can it.  Made my day when I found that out because we always have to many leftovers all the times and when I found this one could be canned to be eaten a bit later that made it more delicious to me!
184960,517166,2016/1/19,5,"Great recipe. I didn&#039;t have any tomato sauce, so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes. It was fine. The only other changes was I added some grated carrot a tsp of oregano. Served with corn muffins. Yummy!"
227831,517166,2017/6/17,5,I got a head of cabbage in my weekly CSA box and thought about cabbage rolls but then I came to my senses. I am not so fond of fussy cooking. I think this is great! Comfort food. Includes a great vegetable. I cooked my brown rice ahead of time and added it to the mixture. And I added 1/2 tsp of caraway seed just because. Looking forward to left-overs.
2002030046,517166,2018/8/29,5,I have made this a couple times and I love it... Will be making this a lot more!
2324285,500882,2013/9/22,5,"This is definitely reminiscent of a tuna roll- very impressive!  I changed things around a bit though.  I mixed the dressing, avocado and cucumber with the tuna, and just served that atop a bed of brown rice and baby arugula.  I also used wasabi paste instead of chili paste.  It was a hit."
383346,502306,2013/7/2,5,I basted the pork tenderloin from the beginning on the grill.  I wanted it to taste enough lol  It was yummy.  My son also liked it.  Thanks Elizabeth :)  Made for Market tag game
204024,503387,2013/8/11,5,Great smells filled our house all day.  I used the slow cooker method.  This makes a delicious flavored pork versatile to any kind of recipe.   We used it to make tacos.  Leftovers will be made into Cuban sandwiches. Made for ZWTp for Hot Stuff.
67728,503387,2013/9/5,5,"I made this to use in Recipe#504803, and it was perfect! Made it overnight in the crockpot, and then made the sandwiches for lunch that day. It was so tender that it wanted to fall apart into shreds, but I did my best to carefully slice it so we would have proper Cuban sandwiches. I had trimmed my pork pretty well before cooking, so I kept most of the cooking liquid to drizzle over the pork for extra flavor. I will be making this again, thanks for posting! Sorry, no photo, camera went to work with DH that day. Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9 Family Picks"
628279,503387,2015/2/13,5,I did not have sour oranges so I added lemon juice.  This was SO freaking GOOD!!!  I can&#039;t imagine a better pork roast.  We couldn&#039;t wait for it to cook all the way before we started slicing off little bits to taste.  I cooked for the 1st 20 minutes as directed then moved it over to the crock pot.  OH MY GOD
2123645,503387,2018/6/15,5,"So good! I used the crock pot method. I didn't have much time, so I cooked it on high for 5 hours. The meat still came out so tender and flavorful. Don't forget to pour over the set aside mojo before serving!"
173579,492796,2013/1/11,5,This was a wonderful seafood stew.  It was quick and easy to make.  Thanks for posting this lovely recipe.
2000059362,493577,2017/12/20,0,"Doing it for the holiday, what kind of relish"
2002239032,493577,2018/8/4,5,I grew up in Georgia and LOVE pig feet and pig tails. I now live in Ohio and finally found a store that carries the feet but haven't found the tails yet. Cooked your recipe today and it is out of this world!!!
339260,498434,2013/7/19,5,I had been craving Sopaipillas and this certainly fulfilled my craving.  This recipe is very quick and easy to make.  The Sopaipillas had just the right amount of crunch.  I let them drain on a paper towel and them sprinkled them with powdered sugar before topping them off with a sugar-free honey substitute.  Yummy!!!  Made for July 2013 Aus/NZ Swap.
65502,494510,2013/2/6,5,"Tasty, healthy, super easy - how can you go wrong? I used cremini mushrooms and made this exactly as listed. Made for February Sun and Spice Event. Thanks Sue! :)"
47892,498722,2013/4/27,0,"I took a different path with this recipe. First I soaked the seeds in warm almond milk.&lt;br/&gt;Then I added a scoop of thick yogurt to a serving bowl, stirred the honey into the cashew butter and spooned it around the yogurt. Spooned the seed/almond milk mixture around the cashew butter and topped the yogurt with the grapes. Added a sprinkle of cinnamon. Made for Veg Tag/April."
542159,501960,2014/4/6,5,"Loved the balance of flavors in this wonderfully refreshing drink, we both thought it worked perfectly with our dinner and look forward to enjoying it often this summer. Thanks for the post."
1801086265,501960,2014/6/16,0,"This is a great summer drink, all the flavors are perfectly balanced!  Thanks so much for sharing!"
37449,507672,2014/1/20,4,"This was good and a different way to cook cauliflower. A little bland, so added Rustic seasoning to it, yum! Thanks!"
2670771,494355,2013/2/1,5,"This is wonderful!  I made this for the family and made it just how the recipe stated.  I baked it for the time stated.  I had to put it under the broiler to brown a little, just yummy!"
453216,494355,2013/11/1,5,"I&#039;ve made many bread stuffing recipes before, including our old family favorite handed down from generations, and this by far is the best tasting.  I love the different add-ins that my other recipes don&#039;t have.  Thank you for sharing.  May be my new &quot;go to&quot; bread stuffing recipe now."
131126,494759,2013/5/11,5,This was easy and delicious!  I used fat free mayo and reduced the sugar slightly.  The dressing is creamy and has that wonderful poppy seed flavor I was after. Thank you for sharing the recipe!
1038619,525539,2016/6/13,5,Easy fresh salsa that was tasty and really complemented the salmon.
1803734599,525539,2016/7/5,5,"Very easy, quick. With the sweet potatoes (put in oven to grill with onions while salmon was waiting and salsa being chopped), it makes a whole, nutritious, delicious meal. Salmon comes out soft, and the salsa refreshes the dish. (I grilled the fish in the oven on grill - after the potatoes - can be done together partially, as the fish is quicker). Good luck and bon apetit! :)"
2001760444,530536,2017/10/21,0,"Tip 1 - for the top couple of layers of phyllo, omit butter. This makes it easier to cut - which you should do before baking (also easier than after). Much easier to serve when done. Tip 2: After you cut into serving sizes, drip butter on top of phyllo dough - dripping allows you to add butter without disturbing dry phyllo pieces."
2796729,499189,2013/4/24,5,"Hi, I made this tonight for dessert. We all loved it! I follow your blog and really like your recipes."
1056692,499189,2014/1/6,5,"This recipe caused a miracle. Both my 5yo and my picky husband ate avocado and liked it! I cut the recipe in half to use up a leftover avocado, only had vanilla protein powder, and used 6-8 drops of liquid stevia for the sweetener. Even with these changes this was great, and my daughter asked me to make her more of it tomorrow. I&#039;d like to try this with other protein flavors, like cookies and cream, or even the chocolate the recipe calls for. I think my half batch had 5 carbs in the whole thing using u/s almond milk. Thanks for sharing."
895132,499189,2014/4/16,5,"Delicious avocado pudding! Like another reviewer, I only had vanilla protein powder, but that was great, too. Also I omitted the additional stevia because with the honey and stevia sweetened protein powder the pudding was already plenty sweet. Love the idea of adding protein powder. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
39835,502074,2014/4/4,4,Very good and a different way to serve fish. We used the tilapia option and skim milk. Served with extra grapes for a very enjoyable meal. Thanks for sharing!
1911882,496213,2013/5/10,5,I had to try these! these were honestly pretty good! I did use apple cinnamon instant oatmeal added some chopped pecans. for only having two ingredients these defiantly helped my craving for a cookie...lol without the guilt! I will make these again!
2882644,496213,2013/6/29,4,"As a diabetic this recipe really intrigued me.  I must say it exceeded my expectations.   I like my cookies a little sweeter, so I will add a little Splenda or (pure/organic) honey to sweeten them up.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I give them 4.5 stars, but the real test will come when my grandkids try them."
1802849661,496213,2015/8/31,5,Great recipe and so simple to make! Perfect for snacks or breakfast on the go!
1802738659,496213,2015/11/11,4,"These should not be considered &quot;cookies&quot;. Really, this recipe should be called &quot;build your own energy bar/snack recipe&quot;. I&#039;ll make this again, but probably as a bar, and with more add ins. As-is, it&#039;s very gummy, and a little bland...and I added peanut butter and sugar on top! It&#039;s all good as long as you&#039;re not expecting this to be a cookie or a dessert. Still, it was easy and fine for my tastes."
2001744935,496213,2018/3/9,5,"Loved these ... and I love good health ... and easy things ... made these smaller, added cinnamon. Made in my toaster oven. Deliciously easy and plain."
498224,496257,2014/9/21,2,"I rated this low due to results.  I will make this again with some major changes.  I followed the directions exactly.  The outcome tasted pretty good but the texture of the rice after cooking for so long was a gelatenous mess.  In making this again I will add the rice about 1 hour from the meat/vegetable mixture being done.  I will also add a LOT more carrots and other root vegetables to this.  There was a nice earthy taste with the mushrooms, beef, carrots and rice seasoning mix."
498271,507278,2013/10/12,4,"Tasty stuffed peppers!  I scaled the recipe to 2 peppers.  I used the whole can of tomatoes (diced, with italian seasoning) and didn&#039;t add the water.  I used hot Italian turkey sausage for the meat and only about half of the can of tomato soup.  Served over whole-wheat angel hair pasta and enjoyed a tasty and healthy meal - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
870569,511652,2015/8/24,4,This w/b bang on had it not been for the placement of soy sauce. Outback uses liquid smoke in their signature side dish. Let&#039;s be real tho most of us don&#039;t hv a bottle of liquid smoke chillin out w/the ketchup and mustard or spicing it up w/our salt and pepper in the spice cabinet. I&#039;ve prepared the green beans both ways always doubling it tripling the sauce itself pairing it w/BBQ lemon pepper chicken ths last tm - it makes for a fantastic marinade and kps chicken frm drying out on the grill too. Thank you for posting!
126440,515188,2014/10/5,5,Very different but so good.  I made as written but served with pear vanilla jam ( I had made a few days before) and sausage patties.
2001962080,534784,2018/1/29,0,REMOVE MY RECIPE THIS IS TAKEN FROM ADVENTURES OF A NURSE!
2002144249,517752,2018/7/20,0,If you don't have a SCOBY you can grow one by using a commercial bottle of Kombucha from the store. I did this and I have SCOBYs everywhere!
39835,504292,2013/8/3,5,Delicious fish sandwiches! i used the cod option and thin sliced whole wheat bread. Easy and good! Thanks for sharing!
539686,504292,2013/8/6,5,This is the best fish sandwich I&#039;ve ever made! So much flavor and easy to make. The sweetness of the slaw marries perfectly with the zippy punch of the spices on the fish! Made for ZWT #9.
174096,504292,2013/8/9,5,"Yum, this was a wonderful fish sandwich!  The cornmeal really worked well for the crispy coating.  The pineapple slaw was fantastic with it.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
204024,504292,2013/8/11,5,"First time making a fish sandwich and it was wonderful!!  Loved the easiness of breading and cooking the fish.  Loved the Slaw, perfect combination with the fish.   Made for ZWT9 for Hot Stuff.  This is going in my favorites of 2013."
128473,514230,2014/4/23,5,"This was a lovely soda bread.  Quick and easy to make, great flavor, with a beautiful crumb.  I made 1/2 the recipe, using all white flour.  I love raisins and caraway seeds together so used both options in this lovely treat.  I cooked the bread at 425 for 20 minutes and then at the lower heat for 20 minutes, resulting in a perfectly cooked bread.  Thanks for sharing this special treat Annacia.  Made for Spring  Pac 2014."
2002297286,537089,2018/10/12,5,I haven't made it but I would either use real fruit jam like raspberry and strawberry and black grapes or whatever red fruit you can find mush the fruit and boil and add sugar and water and maybe some syrup just a tad and blend well. Or mix the jams together and blend together. Or you could also use Jolly ranchers red ones and a little corn syrup and or cornstarch for thickener and some water and melt on stove and add some jam in there as well. I'm gonna tackle this for a church party and see how it turns out.
2549237,504292,2013/8/15,5,"So, I&#039;m sick and in the hospital, but my husband has been cooking for the ZWT9 challenges and for himself and our kids.  They really enjoyed this meal and he said it was easy to prepare.  I will definitely be making this for our family when I get home and recooperated.  Thanks LifeIs Good.  Made for team Tasty Testers during ZWT9. UPDATE 8/15/13: I made these today for lunch, because I missed out on them when I was sick.  My three year old, who normally doesn&#039;t like fish kept saying &quot;more sandwich&quot; for like an hour after lunch.  This was fairly simple and a healthier lunch alternative.  It is sure to be made often here.  Thanks LifeIsGood!"
482933,504292,2014/1/13,5,Muy bueno! Delicious! Fairly easy to put together. I made coleslaw in morning as we were going to be gone all afternoon. We enjoy a similar entree at Wisdom&#039;s in Tumamcacori so knew this would be a hit and it certainly was. Muchas gracias.
80353,504292,2014/8/8,5,Great fish sandwich!  Used cod.  Loved the flavour combo.  Served with grilled pita breads.  Will definitely make again.
226867,499376,2013/6/12,4,Lovely luncheon salad! Didn&#039;t have any pita so served it on toast. It would be nice inside of a scooped out tomato or in a cantaloupe melon half.
780172,499376,2013/10/22,5,"Liked all the added ingredients to this egg salad, made it a full meal. Did serve it on healthy bread."
1802668957,499376,2014/4/14,4,"This is a very nice lunch meal, I used a splash of apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. I diced some red onions which really added a nice punch."
2001676174,532075,2018/1/18,5,This Coffee-Infused steak is awesome. I found leaving it set marinated over night is awesome ! !
2001928881,532075,2018/3/3,5,"I followed this recipe with a porterhouse steak and it turned out fantastic. Using fresh ground coffee is best, and I let the rub sit on the steak for 24 hours before. Make sure you adjust the cooking time for the thickness of the steak if you want medium rare."
2001835916,532075,2018/6/1,0,Yum!!! Yes coffee.
2337201,512079,2014/8/23,5,Wow! These were awesome!! Amazing!!!
2001148316,512079,2016/9/1,5,Definitely a hit!
2001259069,512079,2016/11/21,0,Are these cookies chewing? Do they have a dry texture?
461834,502789,2014/10/6,5,"Wonderful potato pancakes!!!  I made 1/4 of the recipe and I did cheat and use &quot;Simply&quot; Hash browns, which are already peeled, shredded and drained.  I have never seen lingonberries at our store, so just topped with a little sour cream and chives.  Served these with the bacon on the side and some scrambled eggs for a delicious brunch.  Made for your win in the Football Pool!!"
305531,502789,2014/10/10,5,I didn&#039;t peel my potatoes but did follow the rest of the directions. Very nice potato pancake that we enjoyed with brunch. Thanks Linky for sharing. Congrats on your Football win...again!
128473,502789,2017/9/6,5,Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe Linky. I love all types of pancakes and these tasty pancakes were no exception. I enjoyed the potato pancakes very much. They were quick and really easy to make with lovely results. Served with a little butter and salt and pepper. made for CQ4-Scandinavia.
1802339004,507724,2014/1/14,5,"This dish was very delicious, tasty and I&#039;ll cook this dish for my family again. I used a sweet, regular onion instead of onion powder, olive oil instead of bacon grease and a couple of different seasonings that I added for my taste. :-)"
2200822,507724,2015/2/20,0,Didn&#039;t make it yet but wondering when to use bacon grease. Didn&#039;t see it mentioned in the directions.
2002007246,508776,2018/2/22,5,The consistency of the sauce when added to the egg plant was not how I expected it to be (it was a tad watery) but nonetheless was so delicious and tasted exactly like the ones at PF Chang's!
2674623,494443,2013/2/22,5,"This sauce is delicious!  I believe the recipe calls for 6oz can of tomato sauce, but I used tomato paste.  I am sure that it is just an oversight because it turned out exactly as it should.  The flavor is just amazing.  I have made it a couple of times.  I have made it spicy or not, and even put it in my crockpot to ""blend"" the flavors.  A must try!"
168462,496696,2013/3/9,5,"This is absolutely fabulous. I wanted to use what I had on hand so I used soy sauce not tamari, mirin not sake and I added some chili garlic paste for some heat and I added some chicken soup base not salt. I also just added the corn starch to the water mixture to eliminate a step. This was so easy and packed with flavour. What a great way to eat vegetables. I am just sorry I did not make a double batch. Thank you so much for posting"
80353,503363,2013/8/22,5,"You can buy these everywhere in Greece, but it was nice to make up some fresh.  Scaled way back to make 10 stuffed dates and used blanched almonds rather than skinning (saved lots of time!).  These are a delicious, little treat."
67728,503363,2013/9/6,5,"This is a lovely way to enjoy fresh dates! I used sliced almonds for this (what I had on hand), and I garnished the finished dates with some cinnamon and sanding sugar. I had 21 dates to make up 1 lb, so I divided the almond paste into 21 portions before starting the stuffing process. The orange flower water and cinnamon were perfect complements to the jammy dates. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9 Family Picks"
169430,494569,2014/4/11,5,"Mmmmm, this is delicious. We had it this evening with some leftover roast chicken and a corn and red pepper mix. The potatoes were the hit of the meal. Had to use Monterrey Jack as I couldn&#039;t find Munster around here and a mild cheddar for the American. It all came together wonderfully though. I&#039;ll surely make this again. :D"
2001485263,530224,2017/4/12,0,"What size is the tart pan? Thanks, Jackie"
47559,503704,2013/7/27,5,Great Cajun flavors in this recipe.  We loved this.  Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers ZWT9.
204024,505616,2013/8/25,5,Nice snack for nut lovers.   I used recipe#503579 #503579 by IngridH. for the ras el hanout.  Made for ZWT9 for Hot Stuff.
169430,505616,2013/11/8,5,"Thanks a lot for another addiction Bethie! I defy anyone to stop at a small nibble, it can&#039;t be done. Seriously, these are delicious. I adore nuts and these appease that crunch craving with an A+ rating. Must be off now...need to make more, :D. UPDATE: I just wanted to say that I have made these (yet again, lol) and added a small drizzle of honey and cinnamon. Wow, wow, wow. I&#039;m going to have to start buying stock in the nut company&#039;s!"
47892,505616,2013/11/9,5,"The first batch I added the optional honey and burnt the nuts! Also, if you add the honey perhaps lower the temperature by 25 degrees or so. The house smelled wonderful while the second batch was slowly roasting. Great combination of flavors and easy, too (used homemade ras el hanout!). Made for NA*ME tag/Autumn."
50509,505807,2014/3/1,5,"We really enjoyed this for dinner tonight. I soaked the noodles a little too long, my fault. I also used some sliced sweet bell peppers in addition to a bit of the carrot (which I got tired of cutting up!), and less of the nam pla and soy sauce (I think I used about 1/3rd). Very flavorful, I only wish scallops were a bit more reasonable."
2268330,530224,2017/4/8,0,The nutritional information does not include the puff pastry. The carb and calorie count are higher than is displayed in the nutritional information.
2001479218,530224,2017/4/9,0,It would help to know the size of the tart pan needed.
556600,530224,2017/4/11,5,Added gruyere to the mix
2001484729,530224,2017/4/12,0,Can this be made crustless?
2001485158,530224,2017/4/12,0,Im so trying this. It looks GREAT! The recipe uses multicolored carrots. :) So The red veggies are also carrots. A mandolin veggie cutter cuts the veggies into very nice strips.
1802413215,530224,2017/5/6,0,I would love to make this but I have a question ladies. where can I buy multi-colored carrots? I have stores like Trader Joes &amp; Whole Foods and never seen colored carrots or never thought to look for them. Please help...
2001489747,530224,2017/4/15,5,"It's VERY good. Be aware the making of the flowers is a bit time consuming. I added minced garlic, fresh ground pepper, Italian seasonings and thyme rather than oregano. Extremely good!"
2001492165,530224,2017/4/16,0,Serve hot or cold?
2001491182,530224,2017/4/16,3,DELISH!!! Next time I am not going to try to get the vegies to roll up. It took FOREVER!!! Most of them broke before they even rolled. Next time I am going to lay the veggies in parallel lines over the tart.
2001492985,530224,2017/4/17,3,"I give this a 5 star review for presentation and WOW factor but 3 star review for taste. The filling is so bland. I even looked at some of the recipe tweaks and added garlic for more flavor but it needs more of a kick. I followed the recipe exactly with the veggies- sliced thin, micro for 1 minute. A tip for rolling is to place the seam of your &quot;flower&quot; very close to one that you have already put in to prevent unrolling. The veggies were still pretty raw when finished and were definitely lacking a roasted flavor. I let the tart sit for over an hour and we ate it at room temperature. I will try this again but with more seasoning and I will cook vegetables for a longer amount of time so they are softer."
2001494139,530224,2017/4/17,0,Turned out really well but will probably add mustard to Base as it was a little bland ...felt it needed a little more Zing . Or perhaps some Horseradish sauce instead of Mustard . I used a potato peeler to prepare very thin slices of veg and it worked perfectly . But it was trial and error to begin with and mine were also breaking initially . They roasted well after brushing with olive oil . Will certainly be making again. We had some hot and today will finish at room temperature. Definitely 5 stars
2001498248,530224,2017/4/20,0,"I haven't tried the recipe yet, but I want to. The tart will make for a beautiful presentation. I plan to experiment with different vegetables, maybe use Swiss or Havarti cheese and, instead of oregano, I definitely want to use Herbes de Provence."
2001499071,530224,2017/4/20,0,"This recipe is rather labor intense, but sure has a wonderful presentation. A few suggestions: I would just use a regular pie crest and cook it first. Carrots need to be cut very thin and micro waved for a longer time then you think (Until they are rather soft). Use a tooth pick to hold them together after rolling them till it's time to put them in . I used summer squash and zucchini (nice colors) and they cook very fast. The part that needs some doctoring up is the cheese mixture. We made 6 individual ones and let every one doctor their own cheese mixture the way they wanted. Some ideas are, hot red pepper flakes, fresh basil, ginger, turmeric, fresh parsley, garlic and so on. These only cooked for about 25 minutes. So hope this is a help to someone. It was really fun making them."
2001517138,530224,2017/5/1,3,"So, I've made this twice. The first time was a HUGE disappointment = so bland for all that work. I just made it again, adding Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and minced garlic. SooOOoo much better. If I'm going to put in that much work, I want TASTE. And, I used regular pie crust which is so much better than puff pastry. Finally, my mandolin did not slice the veggies thin enough to roll, so I used a potato peeler, which was not only much better but allowed me to roll two or three slices together, saving time and producing a lovely &quot;rose&quot;."
2001523838,530224,2017/5/6,0,"Definitely going to make this beautiful ( I'm sure, yummy as well) recipe! But, don't you think that the veggies should be steamed slightly ( to make softer and prevent undercooked &quot;roses&quot; later)? Your thoughts on this??????"
2001527509,530224,2017/5/8,0,How do we feel about adding beets?
2001529063,530224,2017/5/9,4,"I thought the tart came out pretty delicious, it was a bit more subtle in the flavor department, but i served it with french onion soup so it was a nice lighter flavor next to the caramelized onion and salty broth. Similar to others I had trouble rolling the roses so i made a spiral with the veggie slices. I used a regular pie crust as well which worked great. Also would recommend steaming longer as the zucchini was cooked nicely but carrots were still too firm."
2001529961,530224,2017/5/10,3,"The kids helped me roll the veggies. It was fun to make and turned out pretty; however, I only recommend making this if you want to impress on appearance more than taste as it was only tolerable. I thought the cheese mixture was bland and it had too many carrots. I would add yellow squash perhaps."
2001537711,530224,2017/5/14,4,"Great brunch recipe... after a few tweaks! Used Gruy&egrave;re cheese instead of mozzarella. Added a tablespoon of garlic powder to the mixture and was liberal with salt and pepper. Used purple and orange carrots as well as zucchini and summer squash. Had to cook the carrots in the microwave for 5 minutes and still had a bit of firmness. Next time will roast the veggies in the oven beforehand. The purple colouring of the carrots also ran a bit into the mixture. Used puff pastry in 9 inch pie dish. Rolling the roses is very time consuming and probably took at least 30 minutes, but worth it. Overall a great recipe, was happy with the flavour and will be making it again!"
2001538002,530224,2017/5/15,5,"Showstopping and tasty recipe! A couple hacks to consider: used a bought pastry shell. Sliced vegetables with a vegetable peeler and steamed in the microwave until very soft. (Mandolin yielded slices too thick). Cheese mixture: needed some very serious doctoring up. I added boursin cheese and some sharp white cheddar to give it some much needed flavour. You can also make much of the tart the night before, for example blind baking the crust, mixing the filling (minus eggs), and peeling vegetables. Note: the purple carrots will bleed slightly so keep them in a separate container then the orange and yellow ones. When rolling, you can stack three or four carrot slices at a time and roll them much faster for making rosettes.I will definitely make this again maybe even an individual tarts?"
2001555310,530224,2017/5/26,0,"I'm about to try this. I've got a few ideas and have taken some tips from all of your advice as well. I notice in the video that the bottom dough looks wet so maybe I'll try the pie dough and cook it well ahead of time. I will also salt my veggies to draw out some water and make them flexible. I'm going to try zucchini, japanese eggplant, summer squash and blanched carrots and (I think) gruyere. We'll see how it goes!"
2000973142,530224,2017/7/30,2,First let me say I followed the recipe to a T. I don't know how anyone could have chewed through the vegetables as they were a little on the tough side. With that being said the ricotta mixture was horribly Bland. The tweaking that I had to do was rearrange the entire recipe. From the reviews that I have just read I can see there were many issues with this recipe and in my honest opinion it should be removed and retweaked. Iced all of my vegetables with a potato peeler. I season them with salt pepper granulated garlic onion powder and a few herbs I added some olive oil and roasted them in the oven slowly which brought up all of the flavor. When cold I easily rolled them up and place them accordingly into the puff pastry. I know everyone has been referring to the pastry and they preferred a pie shell instead of puff pastry. It's just my personal preference to use the puff pastry. As far as the ricotta I added four different cheeses a little bit of sugar fresh parsley and fresh oregano. The flavors were amazing according to everyone that had a taste. They also tasted the original recipe and could not believe it was the same tart.
2001599974,530224,2017/8/6,5,I made homemade pastry and changed a few of the ingredients to what i could source for colour. I also used cream cheese instead of Ricotta and added my own flovours used grated cheese instead of parmeasian
271122,493839,2013/1/21,3,"Tried this recipe tonight with no alterations.  The flavor is superb and the ice cream is necessary.  However, cannot give more stars because the dumplings themselves seem lacking.  Mine were too dry to even hold together and shape.  When the syrup was added, they kind of disintegrated into a mush.  Very difficult to turn & no extra syrup to spoon over.  Is something missing from the dumpling dough?  Would like to try again and re-rate."
266635,506802,2013/10/13,5,"This tomato bruschetta was really good -- I loved the idea of using both the roasted roma tomatoes and the sundried tomatoes as well.  I scaled this recipe way back as it was only the two of us and we still have leftovers for another dish down the line.  The only change I made was to add parmesan cheese vs. the mozzarella.  Made for PRMR, October, 2013."

323186,513731,2014/8/12,5,"Oh yum, this was fabulous!   The feta cheese really puts this over the top, quite frankly, the only thing I would say is, this is potentially a salty dish, especialy if you are someone who generally doesnt use much salt,  so just watch your seasoning.   I did alter slightly in that I really prefer not to cook whole fillets of chicken if I can avoid it, I much prefer to cube and cook like that,  and I did do that in this case.  The chicken came out so tender,  and the sauce is just divine, this is a total make again for me.  I served this over linguini,  it would be equally good over rice, I just felt like noodles.     Thank you lazyme,  a really good recipe which I&#039;ll be making again soon.   I made and enjoyed this for International Agents of QUEST, Russian sector"
226863,513731,2016/12/17,5,"This is wonderful! I'd double the sauce, especially if serving over pasta. We loved it and wanted extra servings, but tried to be good! I sprinkled extra feta over the pasta before serving the chicken and sauce over it. I left the salt out of the recipe since the feta has such a salty taste. Thanks for sharing! Made for your win in football tag."
135470,536044,2018/7/29,3,"This was good but more like a wine cooler than a cocktail, and a little thin. After trying it I added more of the pineapple vodka. (I infused my own vodka and it was delicious). The wine I used was also slightly effervescent and shaking it knocked a lot of that out, and the lid kept trying to pop off the cocktail shaker. I left out the club soda since I knew the bubble would go flat with shaking. I think muddling the mint and adding the vodka in the glass then topping and lightly stirring with the wine would be improve sparkle."
1925885,536044,2018/8/1,5,"Like Momaphet, I infused my own vodka so I wouldn't have to buy a whole bottle! Had an open bottle of white wine in the fridge, but not a sweet type, so I added a little sugar when muddling the mint &amp; lime. Gently stirred in the club soda after shaking so as not to burst all the bubbles! This resulted in a very tasty little cocktail (or two!). Great on a sweltering day!

The predominate spice is cumin, which I am a HUGE fan of, with underlying tones of cinnamon...delicious!!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper!!  Made for ZWT9 North Africa for The Apron String Travelers."
163112,504321,2013/8/23,5,"Absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved it!  The only change I would make is to use 1tsp cinnamom so it&#039;s more pronounced, as the name implies plus reduce the cumin because it is so strong.  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers., Spice It Up! Challenge."
169430,515620,2014/5/18,5,"To start with I had to make a couple of sub&#039;s. The market was having a sale on fresh corn but when I got there (3 days into the week long sale) they had completely sold out! So, I used frozen kernels. Them no poblano&#039;s around here so used jalapeno. OK, that said these came out amazing. I have been craving something Tex-Mex for awhile and this really hit the spot. Used the last flank steak in the freezer and it had been tenderized so the beef was flavorful and easy eat. The salsa packed a great flavor delight also. All in all Houston, we have a keeper.

2585084,494155,2013/1/27,5,Hearty and smelled heavenly!  The Hidden Valley contest ingredients were used perfectly.  My family enjoyed this delicious bread and can't wait for me to bake it soon.
131126,494155,2013/2/23,4,"I thought this was a creative use of the contest ingredients and after seeing the photo knew I wanted to try it.  When reading the recipe a  full tablespoon of baking powder seemed excessive, but the bread rose like crazy. It was almost three inches over the top of the loaf pan after baking.  The loaf though had a denser texture than expected. It did have a nice onion flavor and beer undernote. (I used a full bodied craft beer.) Thank you for sharing your recipe and good luck in the contest!"

1226388,505784,2013/8/28,5,"Yum!!  This was part of a delicious dinner tonight and my family loved it.  The only thing I did different was that I had a very big clove of garlic, so I sliced it with the onions and it came out sweet and tender.  I also addred some red bell pepper, just because it was sitting in my fridge and looked like it wanted to go to the party.  It was a great addition! made for ZWT9 Family Pick"

266635,502991,2013/8/24,5,Absolutely delicious -- loved the way that the dates and butternut squash gave a sweetness to this savory dish.  I used organic frozen butternut squash so this dish came together quickly -- I just set the pot to medium-low and cooked over a longer period time so the flavors could meld and the veggies could get nice and tender.  Served this dish over couscous and we were in heaven.  This recipe is going into my Best of cookbook for sure.  Made for ZWT9.
695933,507507,2013/11/4,5,"I usually make recipes twice before I rate them as I seriously dislike reviewers who change, then rate the recipe vs making it as written first. Good as written so I am rating this 4 stars for ease, time and ingredients usually on hand. But for my family&#039;s preference I made the following modifications. Used spiral noodles in place of egg noodles as they capture more sauce. 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 hot italian sausage which gave the casserole more complexity. Used small pre-sliced pepperoni to save time. Most importantly, this is a great casserole for making ahead, as with many pasta dishes, the flavor gets better the longer it sits. Overall this is a great base recipe to build on. Oh, and be sure to cover the top with foil or it will burn! Thanks for sharing this fun recipe! Thanks so much for a GREAT new recipe! BUT over all This is a 6 Stars! P.S.  If someone is making this for the first time know that you should be feeding a crowd! or at least make it in two dishes so you can freeze one for a later date. I ended up freezing half the dish after 4 of us ate us at until we were stuffed. Cant wait to make this for a Pot luck!  I will definitely make this again.  PRMR 2013....Grpa  Thank you, again.Have a great week and I&#039;ll see you in the threads!"
870705,507507,2013/11/30,5,Fantastic recipe!  I added some canned mushrooms I had to the sauce and used more cheese than the recipe called for...maybe 3/4 of a cup more.  And I took the first reviewers advice and covered the dish for a bout 25 minutes then uncovered and sprinkled the rest of the cheese on top and put it bake in the oven for 5 more minutes. Wonderful!  Made for Pammyowl&#039;s Cookathon.
2000844812,525767,2016/1/29,5,Super healthy and great for breakfast
2735189,497394,2013/3/13,5,A great combination of two of my favorites!  It was also easy to make.  A real winner with our family!
2739031,497394,2013/3/16,5,"Yummy and easy to put together, great for a cold winter day"
323186,497993,2013/6/3,5,"Happy to say we loved this recipe,  DH especially raved and was very very happy to have leftovers!!   My only problem was to source laksa paste, in the end I was unsuccessful and made my own, using a recipe found in the Australian Womans Weekly New Curries recipe book, page 113. This turned out for the best since I could control the spiciness, in the end we agreed I could have added more chilli, something I&#039;m always careful about since DH doesnt tolerate it well.   Lovely recipe, Pat, one for the keepers file, thank you!!"
2667767,494149,2013/1/30,5,This sounds delish!
306726,494149,2013/2/20,5,I would love this potato salad!!!!
169430,497233,2013/3/27,5,"Thank you very much for sharing this recipe Mia. I made it last evening and it was a real success. Maybe it spoke to hubby&#039;s German blood or maybe it was sweeter and mild flavors that he well liked but whatever it was I got his &quot;permission&quot; to make it again. High praise from him is &quot;You can make this again&quot;, lol. I couldn&#039;t locate any juniper berries around here so that ingredient was a pass that I regretted as I know that it&#039;s an important one. This isn&#039;t a difficult recipe and while it does take time it&#039;s mostly passive time and the result is worth it. What a lovely change up from the standard pot roast with carrots and potatoes. I served this with mashed potatoes and green beans."
80353,503563,2013/8/31,5,Delicious!  Chicken thighs works so well for this.  The aromatics work beautifully together.  This is one larb-loving family. :-)
895132,503563,2013/9/6,4,"This was quite good flavour-wise. I love galangal, it adds a very special flavour which cannot be quite imitated by ginger. The only thing I really didn&#039;t like was the ground rice sprinkled over the dish. The flavour of the toasted and ground rice is very nice, but somehow it gave my dish the consistency of soggy breading. I&#039;m not sure if this is intended but we definitely didn&#039;t really like it - personal preference I guess :) It was a very interesting experience, though, and I like the idea of that toasted and ground rice. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 Family Picks for The Apron String Travelers"
1620171,503563,2014/1/16,5,"This was lovely. I had some dried galangal which I just didn&#039;t soak long enough, so grated it a bit then gave up and used some ginger instead. Used chicken mince bought, but otherwise made as written. I loved the smell of the ground rice. I didn&#039;t get a soggy breading flavour, but it was a little gritty. Still tasted great. I served in a lettuce cup on rice and all diners enjoyed the meal."
2002267027,496391,2018/9/5,5,I made these for my son and they were a hit! I made my own BBQ sauce they fell of the bone!!
306726,494951,2013/2/22,5,Yum! This recipe looks like creamy comfort food at its best!
1925885,504666,2013/8/1,5,"OMG!!!  This recipe is going in my Favorites right now!  Not even sure how to describe it except to say it&#039;s a flavor party in your mouth!  Even though there are a lot of strong flavored spices in the recipe, the flavor is subtle and delicious.  DH kept saying &quot;there&#039;s something different in every bite&quot;!  And though he&#039;s never expressed an opinion on how to rate a recipe, he kept saying &quot;You&#039;ve got to rate this a five...&quot;.  So five it is.  If I could give it more, I would.  Now, the finished dish is not exactly pretty or photogenic in any way, like most Shepherd&#039;s Pies.  DH suggested that next time (and there WILL be a next time) we slice a hard boiled egg and fan it over the top, then sprinkle with finely minced parsley. I cut the recipe in half and baked it in individual gratin dishes - it was just perfect!  Thank so much for posting this, Nancy!  Made for ZWT9 Gourmet Goddesses."
323186,504666,2013/8/5,5,"This was really good,  everyone had seconds!!!   I omitted the milk and butter  from the sweet potato topping as my cousin is lactose-intolerant,  we really didnt miss it.  Amazingly tasty,  my husband wants this again soon!   It reminded me of a cross between South African bobotie,  with all the sweet/savoury contrasts in the meat filling,  and a Shepherds pie.    Very glad we tried this, thank you Ck2plz,  made for ZWT9, Pink Panthers On The Prowl."
280271,500909,2013/6/23,5,I&#039;m not one who really likes my whole meal planned in one recipe...but this sure did work for me...I left the asparagus whole...and after cooking the potatoes in the foil I threw them on the grill to give them some nice markings...we loved the vinaigrette and I plan to use it on my extra asparagus that I have...the chicken was nice and moist...I just cut my breast in half through the center to get cutlets...I like that they cooked up fast...I was really surprised at how easy this was to throw together...I heated some rolls on the grill...and dinner was ready in no time...thanks for posting it...
934565,499022,2015/9/23,4,This was fast and an easy change of pace from the usual stir-fries. The recipe needs to clarify the addition of the mushrooms. I substituted cubed boneless chicken thighs for the mince. I made the mistake of adding salt. Don&#039;t!
37449,498359,2013/4/26,5,"I enjoyed this couscous for dinner one night, and with some sesame ginger dressing for lunch a few days later. Good flavors. Made for PRMR game."
169430,498359,2013/8/25,5,"This made a great take along lunch. It&#039;s ingredients are great together and, as with such things, improve with a bit of standing time. The ingredients are wonderful together and I especially love the cashews. :D"
128473,500612,2013/6/4,5,"What a lovely recipe Sica.  These were so good.  I loved them. Quick and easy to make with great results.  The fritters were perfect, crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. The sauce is amazing, we so enjoyed it, and its so easy to make, we will be enjoying these often.  Even my picky dh loved them, thank you so much for sharing."
2912768,500612,2013/7/22,5,Always searching for new recipes to use up the overflow of zucchini!  These fritters-along with the mayo- are outstanding!  Thank you Sica for posting this!!  It is a keeper for sure!
1802636249,515062,2014/4/1,5,Wonderful!&lt;br/&gt;I just love chicken and potatoes!
2002280267,526408,2018/12/10,4,"Very good marinade. Added more garlic. I roasted it at 450 for 15 minutes, fat cap on top, then roasted at 300 until done, about 35 minutes later, using a meat thermometer for a 5 lb roast. Served it with a little Dijon on the side. 60 minutes would be way too long for a 2 lb roast."
226863,511486,2014/1/11,5,"At Pat&#039;s suggestion, I used spring onions instead of white for the color contrast.  These taste wonderful, but I had a horrible time getting them to stay together and to get brown.  I used my Scan Pan non-stick skillet, but I&#039;m afraid all my nice &quot;golden brown&quot; pieces just kept sticking to my non-stick surface. LOL. These taste like a twice-baked potato.  Very enjoyable.  Going ahead and giving this 5 stars for the taste....it was probably my fault that I couldn&#039;t get them to crisp up and turn golden brown.....although you can see I did manage to save just a bit from my photo! Thanks for sharing!"
169430,511486,2014/1/18,5,"DS is home for a few days so I did a Sat morning brunch that included these great hash browns. I didn&#039;t have any green onions so I used red onion which helped with the color factor. The recipe worked very well in an old and well used cast iron skillet. It was a great hit with DS, he ate 3/4 of them, lol. Hub and I also enjoyed them very much."
1706426,495319,2013/3/1,4,"This has promise, but I think it would be better suited to a crock pot The meat was tough, as round steak tends to be, so would greatly benefit from a longer, lower temp. cooking time. Thanks for posting, made for Dining on a Dollar 2013"
1925885,502811,2013/8/11,5,"Every SINGLE part of this recipe is fantastic!  Everything is seasoned exactly right and all the flavors complement each other. The presentation is very pretty and I would definitely serve this to company.  The Adobo marinade is killer.  And the zucchini salsa is really a salad. I would eat it all by itself any day!  Thanks for posting! Made for team Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
2000958268,522331,2016/7/10,3,"I made this using plain Greek yogurt (that's what I had on hand) and frozen wild blueberries, which dyed the whole thing purple. It doesn't taste bad, but I probably wouldn't make it again."
1800132880,507795,2013/10/17,5,Exactly how I make it. One of my favorites.
226867,507795,2014/4/27,5,"This was so good that my DH and I ate the whole thing for supper! It would have been reasonable to eat half and save the other half for tomorrow, but it was just too yummy! So, yeah, I&#039;ll be making this again!  made for PAC Spring 2014"
482376,507795,2015/3/3,5,"This recipe really surprised me. I thought it sounded interesting, but I wasn&#039;t sure I would love it. I did! The sour cream and breadcrumbs were really yummy on the steamed cauliflower. Thank you!"
200862,495303,2013/3/1,5,"Made for DINING ON A DOLLAR, Feb.2013.  This recipe was a lovely surprise -- real homey, savoury, comfort food! I was very uncertain about the instruction to bake cabbage with the chicken for 45 minutes -- wayyy too long for cabbage, I thought. But this chef got it all right. I followed the recipe exactly as it was put down, using perhaps a little more veggies. The only very slight difference (which cannot make a difference to the outcome) was that I used a can of whole cherry tomatoes in their sauce (all I had). For seasoning, I used a local ""Grill and Braai Seasoning"", as McCormick is not available here. Adding ketchup to canned tomatoes is a great idea -- it intensifies the flavour. Taking into account that the contest list of ingredients was quite a challenge to work with, this simple dish was a great success with us. I was careful with the mozzarella topping, as mine was the common supermarket type, not the soft buffalo mozz. I added black pepper, and only left it in the oven to start melting, and then removed it. Thank you for a lovely home-style dish full of flavour and goodness! And good luck!"
865936,495303,2013/3/1,4,"This was a good, wholesome one-dish meal! I made it with a bit more of the vegetables and half the meat (personal preference). I also prepared it with a bit less salt and next time would leave off the cheese, or perhaps use Parmesan."
1900993,495303,2013/3/2,3,As a lover of casseroles this one made a suitable supper for me with plenty left over for another time.  Chicken happens to be one of my favourite casserole foods but in this case I would have chicken breasts with a more suitable vegetable that makes up the majority of the meal.
2001337436,495303,2017/1/5,0,Not sure how it turned out yet since its still in the oven lol I used potato instead of green peppers as I didn't have any. I also used garlic and curry to season with. I couldn't use the cheese because I didn't have that either! Lol it smells amazing tho and I can't wait to eat!!
1801075584,496602,2013/12/21,5,"My family is absolutely OBSESSED with this recipe. My mom has MS and can&#039;t have gluten or dairy, so it&#039;s hard to find yummy things she can eat. This IS incredible! We added more tomato because we like tomatoes and didn&#039;t have cumin, so we used 1/2tbs chili powder. Also, we chopped the garlic and onions and jalape"
2001670178,496602,2017/8/13,5,I got this recipe from watching a Shaytards video too!! Love and miss them. Thanks for sharing this I was looking on line hoping I could find it!!
2001665110,530466,2017/8/9,0,"I was so excited to try this recipe. Love spaghetti squash and well chicken. It was so bland, no flavour. I tried adding more salt, basil, garlic, but it had no flavour. Very disappointed"
1802755036,505875,2014/5/20,0,"They smell incredible but the moment you pop it into your mouth you realize... they are terrible. Very, very bland. Thankfully I like to divide a new recipe into thirds and mess with the recipe the second and third rounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With my 1st batch I followed the recipe completely. No modifications. They came out extremely bland. Better than plain old oatmeal but if you were looking for a half decent cookie you would be sorely disappointed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the second batch I added a TBS of Honey. It helped but still on the bland side. Definitely an improvement on the first round. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the third batch I added 1 TBS of Honey &amp; a handful of chocolate chips. This is by far my favorite combination. HOWEVER, this is NOT a recipe I would recommend or try again for a cookie. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I may make it again as an easy breakfast recipe (make it the night before). This would be incredibly easy for the kids to eat in the car on the way to school and it&#039;s not laden with the sugars that cereal has."
1802958234,505875,2014/7/23,1,This is not a good recipe; they taste terrible.
2123645,505875,2014/9/11,3,"These are OK. I&#039;ve trained my taste buds to enjoy less sweet treats over the years, so I didn&#039;t mind this recipe. There are lots of versions of this type of cookie out there on the internet. I like them with chocolate chips better. Also, I find that adding 1/4 tsp. salt helps to make them not as bland. Very healthy, and good for when you want to have a cookie, but not feel guilty about it."
2000053530,505875,2015/3/10,5,"Anyone who says these cookies are &quot;bland&quot; or &quot;terrible&quot; can kick rocks. Go to the store and pick yourself up a pack of Chips Ahoy if you&#039;re going to knock this person&#039;s recipe, which by the way, is EVERYTHING i want in a cookie. It&#039;s healthy, full of fruit, and simple to make. They have no added sugar, eggs, or flour so you can eat them any time of day. Every kitchen should have these ingredients on hand and they take 2-3 minutes to whip up. You can even add your own zest like chocolate chips, a variety of nuts, dried fruits, flax seeds - anything - to give it more flavor. So if it&#039;s too &quot;bland&quot; or &quot;terrible&quot; for you, it&#039;s not the recipe, it&#039;s you. There are plenty ways to make this creative AND they are tasty even without the added ingredients. Great recipe."
2000138241,505875,2015/4/13,0,"Having a child with egg, peanut and wheat allergies- these healthy allergy friendly recipes without all of the extra sugar are a blessing.  Thank you."
2000241361,505875,2015/6/1,4,"Made these today but I used almond coconut milk, reduced sugar craisins instead of raisins, non dairy chocolate chips and I added some flaxseed.  They were actually very tasty however I think I could have cooked a few more minutes the oats were a bit chewy, I only cooked 15 minutes.  Good and healthy."
2000432936,505875,2015/8/27,4,"Super Tasty! Not a buttery cookie - but sweet and sastifying! A few things:
1. Use BLACK bananas that are already mushy. Otherwise they might not be sweet enough. Let them sit in the fridge/counter until even the flesh is brown/black!
2. Add 1/2 tsp of salt.
3. I didn&#039;t have applesauce, so I peeled and cored 2 small apples, and pureed them with the bananas in a blender. My husband loved the taste they added.
4. I used quick oats, so that the oats wouldn&#039;t be too chewy. Also, because of banana size differences, I had to add more oats until the batter looked like soft oatmeal and held its shape."
2000523106,505875,2015/10/4,2,"I just made these two days ago. I wonder if I did something wrong. While they were okay for taste, it seems they had a rubbery feel to them when done. I thought I&#039;d try to put a few back in for a few minutes but it didn&#039;t make a difference. Any suggestions for me?"
2001579851,505875,2017/6/12,1,I have to give this a one star just for the misleading picture it shows on Pinterest just to get you to click to this sight and for that I would not even try it.
724631,513421,2014/4/25,5,"Delightful side to Recipe#513440.  I&#039;m not great at multi-tasking in the kitchen, but I was able to keep the vegetables on course while preparing the chicken, so I looked like a real chef, and both recipes finished at the same time.  Whoa, I rarely experience that!  Peaches are out of season, so I used an 8-oz. can of peach halves (drained).  I loved the cinnamon glaze on the veggies.  Will make this meal again, thank you for sharing.  Made for Spring 2014 Pick A Chef."
266635,513421,2015/1/22,5,"I absolutely love roasted sweet potatoes and the peaches are a real bonus.  Of course, I made more than the recipe called for and adjusted the coconut oil and maple syrup accordingly.  I elected not to add the onions; although I think caramelized onions are fab.  Made for the For Your Consideration tag game."
1052873,513421,2018/9/1,5,Peaches are great with roasted sweet potatoes. As is maple syrup. Everyone liked this.
169430,508778,2014/4/16,5,This was a real treat. I used it with flat bread crackers and enjoyed every bite. Had to skip the pomegranate bits as that just aren&#039;t available where I live. I think that it would be great as part of a sandwich as well.
131126,508778,2017/7/21,5,"Different, delicious, and bursting with unexpected flavors! I chopped this fairly fine and spread onto homemade (flat) pitas and then tossed on the grill for a few minutes. Divine! This is my favorite type of Culinary Quest discovery. It demonstrates how a few additional ingredient(s) can take pantry staples to new cuisines and flavors. Made for CQ#4."
314579,508778,2017/7/30,4,"I really liked this salad a lot. The combo of flavors is so intriguing and different. I think I will cut back on the parsley next time, just so that the olives stand out a bit more. I used aleppo pepper. This was great as a stand alone salad. We also used it to add more flavor to our lamb stuffed peppers. Thanks for posting CG! Made for CQ 2017, Turkey"
2001336091,523991,2017/1/7,0,The nutrition information on this recipe says the recipe makes 1 serving and the calories per serving is 23.5. Do not be fooled!! That is not correct. I am not a nutritionist but I know you can not eat an entire can of chickpeas and only consume 23.5 calories. That being said I will still try the recipe but food.com please correct your mistake!!!
230102,497478,2017/8/12,5,"These were delicious! I didn't have the Kraft dressing specified, but used Wishbone Lite Italian. I did use the Boar's Head Tuscan turkey, so they had a little bit of heat. Quick, easy, filling with little effort. My kind of recipe. Elizabeth, thank you for sharing, I will make again!"
276311,516491,2016/7/14,5,"This recipe succeeds on two counts - it's creative and fun for summer, and it's also rich and delicious! The cream cheese mixture makes the pudding rich and satisfying, and the cool whip gives it a great texture. The cookies look just like sand and even cling together like sand. Definitely worth a try for a fun, tasty summer dessert."
1802873869,516491,2017/8/2,0,I have two of the same buckets shown in your post. Will this recipe fill one or two buckets??
2001524408,537039,2018/11/6,4,"This tasted really good. When I shaped it, it looked like a Turkey. Once I covered it with the sauce, not so much. After it was baked, not any better. We used the left over sauce on our plates. The flavors really were excellent. I had to cook it an extra 15 minutes. Next time I make it I will par cook the vegtables."
9062524,501851,2014/7/6,0,The ingredients list pecans but the directions say walnuts.  I guess you can mix and match!  I will use walnuts.

2001806579,492859,2017/11/19,5,I have made this recipe a number of time with rave reviews. Any tips or adjustments for a slow cooker method? Finding myself short on oven space
169430,504483,2016/5/9,5,Delightful. I reduced the amount to 1 hen size and that fed DH and I very well. The lemon and oil with the herbs made for a moist and delicious bird. I just may need to put a couple of these baby chickens in the freezer because I certainly intend to make this again.
895132,500622,2013/8/20,5,"These were terrific for my taste! Not too sweet, slightly nutty and not eggy and greasy at all. I&#039;ve made cupcakes with adzuki beans before and always found that they are awesome for baked sweets because of their natural slight sweetness. I used raw cane sugar but will try them with coconut sugar as soon as I get some. Thanks for sharing!"
2001254385,500622,2016/11/19,3,"I didn't have Chia seeds so I tried 2 eggs as a binder. It did not work, they did not hold a shape, crumble easily, and basically must be eaten with a fork/spoon. I like the lower sweetness, but these are missing a certain amount of unctuousness relative to traditional brownies. I'm assuming some fat would help."
37449,504239,2013/11/11,5,"Delicious. I love coleslaw and I love kale salads, so this did the trick for me. I enjoyed the dressing, and it all came together nicely. Thanks!"
187349,512477,2014/4/2,5,"Oh my gosh and Wow! This is really good. I used a package of frozen cauliflower instead of the fresh, which is about 4 cups and kept everything else the same. The flavor is dead on. The mouth texture is not the same as creamy, full fat, alfredo sauce, and is a little grainy, but this might be because of my blender being the cheapo $12.95 K-Mart special. I think that if I had used half and half or cream instead of almond milk I could have gotten that slimy mouth feel. I figure, rounding all my totals up, this cost a little less than $2 to make from scratch. I ended up with 2 1/4 cup of sauce."

482376,517410,2014/8/20,5,"Yummy and easy garlic bread! I usually make mine with butter and (gasp) garlic salt. This was just as simple, but more authentic in flavor.

296809,517410,2014/10/21,4,"Made as written for your Football Pool win. This is a very good basic garlic bread &amp; works well to accompany almost any main-dish. What esp appeals to me is how it can be expanded to multiple taste sensations that suit pers pref. It easily becomes the ever-popular kid-friendly garlic cheese bread or adult versions of bruschetta. It would also be excellent topped w/a flavorful tapenade or tasty pesto. I served it w/a grilled pork tenderloin &amp; twice-baked potatoes, but will try the expanded options mentioned. Thx for sharing your recipe w/us &amp; Congrats on your Football Pool win."
461834,517410,2015/1/26,5,"Absolutely loved this bread!!  I did make one change, I used half butter and half olive oil.  I only had extra light olive oil, so it didn&#039;t have a lot of flavor.  But then followed it as posted.  I really enjoyed the added kosher salt, really made a huge difference for us.  The smell from steeping the oil/butter with the fresh pressed garlic, made me think it would be too strong, but it really wasn&#039;t and we loved it!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe that we will make again.  Made for your win in the football pool, congrats!!!"
486725,517410,2015/4/9,5,"Just the way I like my garlic bread! Though I did use less of the oil. This has the perfect combination of everything, and it tastes better than using butter."
1436160,517410,2016/2/5,5,We thought this was out of this world.  Really enjoyed the garlic infused oil.  A great accompaniment to our spaghetti dinner. Thanks for sharing.
480195,505749,2013/8/24,5,"This was an unusual and delicious treat. I served it as part of a middle easter lunch and DH said I could make this any time, as he absolutely loved it. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
369715,510116,2014/3/24,3,I mixed the meatloaf up but it was very wet so I added another half a cup of saltines. We still found the mixture to be bland and a bit mushy for our taste.
2811559,498917,2013/5/3,5,We made this last night &amp; it was great!!!!  The only problem was that my roast was still partially frozen &amp; it took Forever to cook! (Finally sliced off a couple of slices &amp; microwaved them).  I will do this again &amp; will be great to fix for company.
137302,495979,2014/5/7,5,"These were very good.  My husband ate 4 of them!  If you make the traditional latkes with Matzo bread in them they do taste a bit different, but are just as tasty.  My grater was the wrong size so my DD grated my potatoes with her Kitchenmaid!  I was shocked how quickly it was done.  I definitely had peeled way too many potatoes so I still have a good sized bowl in the fridge sitting in water with lemon juice for a different recipe.  Obviously since my DH loved these so much, I will be making them again in the future.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
169430,510892,2014/1/1,5,"This was the first time I have used the custom settings on my Zo and I&#039;m glad I still had the book, lol. I had to make the starter and for that I used Recipe #506175. Once the starter was ready I used this ABM recipe to make make the bread. It came out quite nice with letting it work overnight and made a fab roast beef sandwich for lunch. We&#039;ll have more with tonight&#039;s dinner. It has a nice texture and the crust was chewy, not crisp or hard. If you have  Zo machine give this a try."

895132,498189,2014/4/29,5,"This was truly amazing! I&#039;ve never had paneer before and decided to give some home made paneer from goat&#039;s milk a try. Worked like a charm and tasted awesome. I loved the flavour of the fenugreek leaves, it&#039;s what makes this taste really special. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
542159,504803,2013/8/4,5,Oh boy are we stuffed! These were so delicious DH and I each ate a whole one after which we were so stuffed that we agreed to split one next time. I used some left over bbq pork from the other night. Thanks for the post.
174096,504803,2013/8/8,5,"Yum, this is delicious!  DH and I split one since I can&#039;t eat quite as much as this made ;)  We really enjoyed the blend of meats and cheese and other flavors with the toasted texture.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
895132,504803,2013/8/11,5,"Delicious! I used four small gluten free baguette rolls and organic ham and pork, not quite sure if it was what the recipe called for, but it made a really delicious dinner accompanied by some coleslaw. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Caribbean for The Apron String Travelers"
67728,504803,2013/9/4,5,"I love Cuban sandwiches, but until now, had never tried making one at home. So good, and really easy to make once you have the roast pork on hand. I made my own roast pork using Recipe#503387 in the crockpot. With a little bit of planning for the roast pork, now I can enjoy Cuban sandwiches just about any time I like, yay! Sorry, no photo, DH had taken my camera for the day. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot PInk Panthers for ZWT9 Family Picks"
140132,504803,2014/11/8,5,This is so good.  I used #349384 for the pork and then pressed the sandwich between the griddle and foil lined bricks.  So good.  Thank you for sharing with us.
305531,506343,2014/8/9,5,"Excellent! I made the spice rub as directed, but cooked the chicken on my counter-top vertical rotisserie. It turned out very moist and tender. Thanks GRPA for a wonderful keeper. Made for What&#039;s for Dinner? tag."
383346,498723,2013/4/30,5,This is a great recipe.  I made half of it.  And ate it all.  Because DH doesn&#039;t like balsamic vinegar on strawberries.  Too bad for him.  Thanks Mikekey :)  Made for Rookie tag game
239758,515858,2016/8/15,5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful salad. I made pretty much as written. I added a couple of chopped green onions because I didn't have quite enough red onion. You are absolutely right—the dressing makes this salad. I've been told I can make this again...and again...and again. Three of us ate all of this one."
47559,515858,2016/8/18,5,I selected this recipe for Culinary Quest 2016 and am very glad I did. It was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. The dressing is unusual - has a strong garlic flavor and the bits of kalamata olive is very unique and delicious. Hubby went back for seconds - the sign of a keeper recipe in our household.
482376,515858,2016/8/19,5,What's not to love with this salad? It was full of all those Greek flavors that we love. I served this for a crowd and it went over very well. We all loved the dressing! Thank you!
92006,515858,2016/8/19,5,Easy ad delicious. I loved the addition of parsley. Thank you for sharing! Made for CQ '16.
266635,515858,2016/8/21,5,Fabulous salad -- absolutely loved the dressing. We didn't leave a drop or leaf on our plate. Will be making this salad often -- definitely a great salad to impress family and guests. Going into my Best of 2016 file.
135470,515858,2016/8/25,5,"This was fresh and delicious, we loved the feta and lemon together. I used all romaine instead of the spring mix. Made for CQ3"
157167,493107,2015/8/12,5,"I left out the tomato sauce due to food sensitivities, but this was an excellent, quick, and filling meal.  I buy my lentils in bulk, and used a 2 cup scoopful - I think another 1/3-1/2 cup would have been the perfect amount for 6 servings."
1803579031,512753,2014/12/29,5,"We have lots of extra goat milk right now, so I spent the weekend making cheese and more cheese, then realized I needed a good ricotta recipe. This cheesecake hit the mark perfectly, and I was particularly pleased that it was gluten free and used sugar alternatives. I doubled everything to use my usual straightedge 10&quot; pie pan, and it turned out spectacularly well, including the crust. Will definitely be using this recipe again, thanks for sharing it!"
380644,512753,2016/7/8,5,Good recipe!
865936,504224,2014/11/8,5,I made these by placing everything in the slow cooker (beans were cooked first) and it came out perfect!  Thanks for posting Link-a-licious!
169430,504224,2017/4/13,5,"I don't usually take the time to soak beans but just start early and let them cook until dinner time. I did soak this time though and I have to admit that they do end up being the better for it. I made half the recipe as it's only for myself and I love that the ingredients don't take a calculator to do the math. It's a delicious soup without the bacon (my personal preference) and all of the ingredients come together like a song, harmonious. Lots of flavor and texture. Thanks Linky for another treat."
895132,496735,2013/7/26,5,"Delicious! This was my first Ponzu sauce ever, and I enjoyed it very much! We had it with cold Vietnamese spring rolls made with rice paper and a salad and shrimp filling, and this sauce was a hit with it. Will make it again! Thanks for sharing.&lt;br/&gt;Made for Ramadan Tag / N*A*M*E Forum"
1925885,496735,2013/11/11,5,"Wow!  This sauce is amazing!  A small bottle of Ponzu sauce costs about $7 here - more than double the US price!  So this is a wonderful find...  Made it mostly as written with the exception of the sake (too expensive here) - substituted mirin and reduced the sugar.  In the future, I will probably leave out the cornstarch so that it turns out a little runnier."
305531,495875,2016/10/1,5,I've never had this at the restaurant before so don't know how it compares. But it was very good and we enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing.
2735295,497256,2013/3/13,5,Probably the best pot roast recipe I have ever tried!
239758,506427,2018/8/31,5,This is a totally wonderful recipe for sweet corn. I made half a batch which was more than enough to brush/dribble over three smallish ears of corn. Served with fried rice and grilled steaks. Thanks so much for posting.
2436752,515020,2014/4/7,5,"Looks absolutely potato-licious, 5 stars for sure."

418718,515020,2014/4/8,5,Awesome and absolutely delicious!!
1072693,507801,2015/3/20,5,I love Houston&#039;s Hawaiian Rib-eye so I was very excited to see this recipe. I followed the directions as stated except I did not see where it said to put the ginger so I put it in the pot with everything else. I also don&#039;t have a grill so I used a George Foreman Grill. I was very happy with the way the steaks turned out although the flavor was not as strong as I would have liked. I will definitely make this again only next time I plan on letting it marinate longer than the two hours stated. Thank you for posting this recipe!
2000496757,507801,2015/9/25,5,"I&#039;ve used this recipe several times and it never disappoints. The longer steaks marinate, the better."
362819,507801,2017/2/22,0,"I enjoyed this marinade. I did a little googling and most Houston copycat recipes say to marinate for no less than 2 days, but I was using this with thin cut ribeyes in the fridge that didn't have two more days left on them, so we just did it for a few hours. It was good! Also cooked the ribeye on the foreman and sprinkled some pineapple slices with sugar and grilled those on there, to top off the steaks. It was a nice compliment. Served with coconut rice and a sugar snap pea medley!"
2001460457,507801,2017/3/28,5,"The food never disappoints! Hands down, best food ever."
2837900,507063,2013/10/13,5,"I make this all the time and I&#039;m surprised there are no reviews. I always spread the cream cheese on the bottom of a glass dish, drain and rise the black beans, mix in the raspberry chipotle salsa, pour on top of the cream cheese and then add the shredded cheese on top and then bake. It&#039;s all going in the same place, I know but it just looks a little prettier when layered."
2001547600,507801,2017/5/21,1,"Followed this recipe, was hoping for nice pineapple flavor. Even cut the soy down to one half cup, used organic no sugar added pineapple juice. Still came out like teriyaki will have to find another recipe. :("
2001623854,507801,2017/7/12,5,"I used this recipe during the 4th of July and only let it marinate for about an hour but it was still very good. I used a can of pineapple chunks instead of juice and I didn't use ginger, but the flavor was still very good. I definitely would use it again."
2002050126,507801,2018/3/14,0,I see this recipe calls for minced ginger. But the recipe never mentions when it is to be used. ??? Presumably added into the marinade at the front end of things?

1680722,505538,2014/11/19,5,"This was a great salad that I will prepare again for sure. We loved the combination of the ingredietens. As herbs I used savory (I wild kind, very spicy I have in the garden) and a perennial basil kind I have in a pot and I will bring through the winter (still with flowers!).The pumpkin (not a butternut but a &quot;no name&quot; one) was a small one from the garden. I halved the dressing, used only 1 teaspoon of harissa and as vinegar I used white balsamico one. I had a mustard with grains that I really love. I did not process the dressing, since simply stirring in a small cup until combined,I topped the salad with sliced green onion. Delicious result, too delaiciou! It was not easy to let a small portion for my DS for school.tomorrow! I almost forgot; I tossed all the ingredients as potatoes and pumpkin were still warm and we eat it lukewarm! I will keep this recipe looking forward to make it again!"
895132,505538,2017/11/20,5,"We loved this salad! I used violet potatoes, and for the herbs I used parsley because that's what I had. The vinaigrette is excellent. Made this in loving memory of Susie. Thank you, my friend, you'll always live on in DH's and my heart."
128473,504282,2015/2/28,5,"Delicious LIG really delicious.  I really enjoyed this flavorful and silky drink.  The ratio of juice to rum is perfect.  Thanks for sharing this great quick and easy to make cocktail. Which I will be enjoying again and again this summer.

227978,504282,2015/4/2,5,"I selected this recipe because I really like passion fruit juice, and this is (now) at the top of my list of favorite passion fruit recipes.

92006,504282,2016/8/4,5,"This was delicious! I used fresh passion fruit pulp from the vine in my backyard. I wish I'd thought of straining out the seeds first, but it was still very much enjoyed. Thank you! Made for CQ '16."
2001330153,515814,2017/1/28,5,"Love these healthy meatballs. We make a big batch and freeze them after they have cooked (without the sauce) and use them as needed (with homemade sweet and sour sauce, with peppers and onions.) We also add 1/4 cup chopped spinach. Line your baking sheet with parchment paper for no stick and no mess."

2000204249,504022,2015/5/15,5,"Awesome traditional Tunisian dish that is best served as a mannish with rice or couscous salad and a glass of wine. Guests will be highly impressed. After having made the Tunisian beef meatballs Kefta my guests proclaimed that it was the food of GODS. The recipe is the most precise and accurate one i have come across so far, i highly recommend it for everyone. Bon Appetite!"
482376,523043,2018/11/3,5,"I loved this veggie side dish!! I didn't bother with cooking my corn. I just shaved it off the cob and threw it in a few minutes earlier than directed. The squash, corn, and butter combination was so yummy! Thank you!!"
67728,500578,2013/8/11,5,"Fabulous ice cream! I found some really nice mangoes at the supermarket the other day, and this was the perfect use for them. Oftentimes, commercial mango ice cream doesn&#039;t really taste like mango at all, but the mango flavor shines here. After 3 hours in the freezer, my ice cream was still pretty soft, but it was still lovely with some chopped fresh mango. This is definitely a keeper, thanks for posting!

80353,500578,2013/8/30,5,"This is definitely a &#039;soft-set&#039; ice cream, which I really love.  I purchased my mangoes a few days ago and allowed them to get soft and very ripe and aromatic.  The flavour shone in this delicious ice.  Added malibu rum for some extra zip and topped with a little toasted coconut.  Wonderful!"
422893,493922,2014/8/29,0,"I made this the other night after seeing it on pinterest. I added some more vegie varieties in the bottom of the tray but otherwise made as directed, the chicken turned out lovely &amp; moist and it was gobbled up by one &amp; all. Thanks for posting!"
99994,502421,2015/6/6,5,Years ago my brother-in-law made this exact recipe from the magazine.  It&#039;s FANTASTIC.  The www and the chef that posted this are great  - who would have guessed years ago that I would be able to find a recipe I haven&#039;t seen in at least 20 years &amp; in less than 10 minutes?  Thanks for sharing.  I can&#039;t wait to make this.
323186,507248,2013/10/7,5,"Although this takes a while to cook, it really requires so little work, its just a case of being at home really!    A great way to use tomatoes, I bought Roma tomatoes and now I have a great supply of tasty dried tomatoes on hand whenever I need them!  I did store in oil,  I sampled a few (okay, more than a few), mmm, delicious!  I used fresh thyme sprigs from the garden and stored them in the jars with the tomatoes.  Good recipe, thank you, made and enjoyed on a quiet weekend afternoon, for PRMR tag game"
2549237,496104,2013/3/26,5,These were simple and my whole family loved them.  They practically attacked them like vultures.  They weren&#039;t much harder than a boxed taco dinner and had the extra nutrients from the beans.  I will use this recipe many times in the future.  Thanks Cooks4_6!  I made these for Photo Tag Spring 2013.

280166,496104,2016/9/13,5,We all loved the flavor of these and my littles were excited that their taco didn't call apart with the first bite. Not sure we will ever have &quot;regular&quot; tacos again. Thanks for posting!
480195,502995,2013/8/25,5,"This is a winner! The only change I made was to use melted butter instead of the almond oil, which I didn&#039;t want to go hunt for. The flavor is just wonderful and it really was easy to make. Not one piece was left over after the party, though I doubled the recipe. I will probably make this again during the week, just for us. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
679953,515540,2014/5/22,5,"Great ham  ..with great results. and with plenty leftover, loved the flavor.  Made this though I used some cherry cola for the cola.  Used 20 cloves on this too.  Very easy recipe, and if there is ham on sale where you are, you might consider giving this a shot.  I did buy a 7 pound ham, so I adjusted the cooking time a little."
2324285,499702,2013/5/12,4,"This recipe sounded very unique so I had to try it as soon as I saw it.  It&#039;s less sweet than I thought it&#039;d be, and as a result it&#039;s kind of bland.  A little brown sugar or palm sugar or even a bit of strawberry jam would&#039;ve really perked up the flavors for me.  Otherwise, I love the idea behind this, and it was pretty good served over fried brown rice."
107583,504589,2013/8/4,5,"This is a bit more work than my usual meatloaf but worth every bit of it.  Lots of flavor (recipe doesn&#039;t call for salt and it isn&#039;t needed, because the bacon flavor cooks into it), and very moist.  I did have to add a little more flour than called for when making the gravy.  Looking forward to a meatloaf sandwich made with leftovers.  Made for ZWT 9."
1098582,507222,2013/10/1,5,"If you are looking for a quick stir fry, this has great flavors!  I made as instructed and we had a great stir fry dinner.  Could use some rice or noodles. Great base to start from!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was also my first time using bok choy- I loved it!  Thanks for introducing me to a new ingredient.  I&#039;ve been missing out my first 43 years..."
1802434782,512584,2014/1/31,3,"I recommend steaming the cauliflower for about 15 minutes before applying the coating and baking, unless you like really crunchy &amp; difficult to cut cauliflower.  Tastes really great thought."
49912,512584,2014/2/3,1,This was a hundred layers of sour---- it took forever to cook and then it was a little on the dry side.  Don&#039;t try this one.  Sorry .....I washed mine off and boiled it a while and was still able to eat it.
45605442,512584,2014/2/12,1,"Bad, bad, incredibly bad. First 30 - 40 minutes at 400 degrees will give you a mostly raw cauliflower, from raw i would recommend an hour to an hour and a half. Second, and mos importantly, 2 TABLESPOONS of chili powder!? I like spicy food but my mother does not so i use half what is called for in recipes, i used 1 tablespoon and it was like eating pepper spray. DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE WITHOUT MAJOR ALTERATIONS!!!"
1802450082,512584,2014/2/18,1,"Truly terrible.  I&#039;m an experienced cook, and my husband and I love roasted cauliflower.  II followed the recipe exactly as written.  It clearly was never tested.  I expected a &quot;unique&quot; appearance, but flavor and texture were very poor.  Don&#039;t waste your time and money on this one!"

I wonder if whoever put this recipe up first (and I&#039;ve found it in a few places) tried it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&#039;s worth a go though."
1802507490,512584,2014/2/19,0,"Don&#039;t be fooled by the nice photo of this dish?mine looked exactly the same, but boy was it awful.  Giving this recipe one star is being generous.  The mix of ingredients, in theory, seemed interesting.  As I followed the instructions exactly, I couldn&#039;t believe the overwhelming amounts of spices I was dumping into the bowl?no way this was going to be edible.  I was right.  This must be a weird practical joke.  Served it to three veggie lovers who all spit it out simultaneously.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! VILE!"
4439,512584,2014/2/23,0,"DH loves cauliflower,, but did not love this. He felt that the spices were too harsh and the yogurt did not help. Part of the cauliflower was raw and part of the cauliflower was burnt."
169410,512584,2014/3/10,4,"We really like earthy VERY hot foods --I used to live in India --the land of spice; however, the 2TBS of chili spice is way to hot which made this dish inedible! Use only 1TBS and it will still be hot but edible. It would have gotten 5 stars if it was not too hot."
2291423,512584,2014/5/14,1,Horrible!  We literally had to spit it out.  It was too awful to swallow.  The whole thing ended up in the trash.  I agree with the other poster who thinks the recipe was never tested.  It couldn&#039;t have been!  Don&#039;t judge this disaster by the photo like my daughter and I did.
41827236,512584,2014/5/20,0,"I tried this recipe as directed and agree with the majority of the posts that is was too hot and way, way, undercooked at 1hour.  I am sure it depends on the size of the head of cauliflower but the one I used was medium and I still ended up cutting it up and steaming it in the Microwave.  The marinade was too much and too hot.  I think the concept is good but the spices were all wrong."
1802798201,512584,2014/6/4,5,I have eaten this before and just cooked it.  I find it very spicy but totally delicious.  I suppose you need to have a palate that appreciates hot spicy food.  I do like the cauliflower to be crunchy also.  &lt;br/&gt;I will make this again and again.
1802844313,512584,2014/6/21,4,"I don&#039;t care for Cauliflower, and wanted to find a way to make it taste good. This fit the bill. I don&#039;t know why people are saying its &quot;hot&quot; chili powder should not make it hot, I used the kind that just adds favor but no heat. I cooked at 375 for longer because otherwise it is not done. I use a mix of Greek yogurt and sour cream depending on what I have. I didn&#039;t use a tablespoon of garlic powder--I have NEVER added less garlic to anything than asked, but I simply couldn&#039;t wrap my head around a whole tablespoon of Garlic POWDER--fresh absolutely--so I used two teaspoons and it was plenty of garlic. I also add a layer of parmesan  cheese which makes for an exceptional crust. This go-round, I used a layer of tomato paste before the &quot;marinade&quot; layer. I gave it 4 stars only because it is still Cauliflower, but would give it a 5 star for cauliflower recipes!"
7302163,512584,2014/8/17,0,Just made this. My boyfriend and I both loved it. I had to adjust the recipe slightly because I was out of cumin so I just added more garlic powder. I didn&#039;t think that the chili powder was overwhelming but I suppose you could cut it in half if you didn&#039;t want it as spicy. I cooked it in my convection oven and it was ready in 45 min. I&#039;m always looking for new recipes for veggies and this one was a great find. I may even try it on the grill next time.
9320208,512584,2014/9/25,3,"I read through all the reviews. I would give it five stars as I made it. I adjusted several things due to the comments.  1) I used half as much chili powder and cumin as advised (1 TBS chili powder, 1/2 TBS cumin). I used fresh garlic (about 4 cloves). I used 1/2 the black pepper (1/2 tsp).  I put the cauliflower head in the microwave on high for three minutes to pre-cook it a bit before I put the sauce/cauliflower on it. I let the cauliflower (with sauce on it) rest in the fridge for about 1/2 hour before putting it in the oven. I baked it for 45 minutes. It came out so good. The cauliflower was cooked through. The sauce made a nice, flavorful crust. I&#039;ll be making it again, using my adjustments. THANK you reviewers for honest reviews."
1803066121,512584,2014/10/2,1,"I wanted to try this because it seemed unique.  Like some others I found the cauliflower wasn&#039;t cooked completely after 40 minutes (and I used the convection oven with fan because it would be hotter.)  Secondly, unless you like VERY Spicy food this recipe is not for you.  I&#039;ll eat it because I won&#039;t throw anything out but I will not make this   I race to the bathroom to brush my teeth afterwards to get that spicy hot taste our of my mouth!"
1859863,512584,2014/10/20,2,"Who in their sober mind would come up with this bizarre recipe, that sounds SO good on paper?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reading the reviews, I decided to cut the cauliflower up, which I didn&#039;t notice anyone seemed to do.  So I put all the small pieces in a bowl with the weird mixture and spread everything on a cookie sheet and baked at about 425 for...I don&#039;t know how long...a good long while, until it was very soft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally I break the head up into small pieces and bake it plain so it comes out soft but not soggy.  THIS recipe made everything soggy, but that makes sense since it&#039;s covered in yogurt and lime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of lime, LIME is the thing that DESTROYS this recipe.  Maybe my lime was too big and juicy but it made the cauliflower painfully sour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the reviews I knew it would be spicy but I didn&#039;t change the recipe at all because few things are &#039;too spicy&#039; for me.  I&#039;ve done two spicy challenges from &quot;Man vs. Food&quot; so I can handle spice.  This is definitely too spicy for normal people.  Again, my problem was the lime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other problem is it tastes POWDERY.  WEIRD, right?  But it tastes like cauliflower coated in a weird powder.  Ugh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The head I used was pretty large but there was still a bit of sauce left over so I added reconstituted dried-minced garlic and dredged a boneless chicken breast in the remaining sauce (there was quite a bit on this one piece of chicken) and threw that in the oven.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THAT WAS TERRIFIC.  Yogurt, spices and lime?  PERFECT on chicken!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yogurt, spices and lime?  WEIRD on chicken!!!!"
1803316815,512584,2014/11/8,0,"THE WORST.  Over-spicy, over-acidic, too much curry, too much lime.  Nasty, disgusting poo-poo."
2000498330,497642,2015/11/5,5,I like a hefty sandwich and this sure is one. Used smoked turkey; delicious combo of ingredients.
653438,494500,2013/4/14,5,This was just like the title said easy and really quite tasty.  I following the instructions only cutting the recipe down a little and using boneless chicken thighs.  Next time I might try adding some sliced onions and peppers but this will be going into our rotation for busy days.  Made for Spring PAC 2013.
1801519864,509335,2013/12/29,5,Loved this!! Perfect balance of sweet &amp; savory.  An upscale version of Manwich without the icky processed food ingredients.  Stayed true to the recipe except used 2T of regular balsamic as I didn&#039;t have the flavored one.
161282,494153,2013/2/28,5,"What a great meatloaf! The only changes I made were I used all beef (couldn't find ground pork) and added an extra minced garlic clove. It was full of flavor and moist. Even if you don't like Ranch dressing, do try this--you don't taste it specifically--all the ingredients just blend together beautifully to produce one tasty entree. While this would be good even without the macaroni (I used elbows), I don't recommend skipping it. It may mean an extra step and a few more dishes, but will make your meatloaf ""stretch"", and besides, it's just plain FUN! I boiled extra and made macaroni and cheese to go along with it, and our ""comfort food"" meal was a success. Thanks for sharing!"
486725,518669,2016/11/30,5,"Love honeycrisps too, so used those, along with brie only for the cheese and no honey or rosemary for our tastes. Really yummy!"
724631,509880,2013/12/25,3,"I have made this recipe twice, and I have been unsuccessful at obtaining high rolls; my best rolls look like hamburger buns.  They taste good.  The first try, I wasn&#039;t as particular about the temperature of the water for the yeast or in following the times for rising in the refrigerator; I also used a stand mixer, which was a mistake.  The second time I tested my yeast (it was vigorous), observed the times in the recipe and raised the house temperature to 66F.  (I understand that yeast likes a house 68-72, but I faint at that temperature in the winter.)  I may have to allow more time for the second rise or find a warmer spot in the house.  I&#039;m new to making rolls, so I can&#039;t say if there is a problem with the recipe, or the problem is my lack of experience in baking.  I recommend that anyone making this recipe try a trial batch before planning on serving to company.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
128473,513350,2014/3/21,5,"We all loved this terrific cake.  Wow, what flavor and the textures were incredible.  So worth the extra effort.  I always loved 7 minute frosting as a kid and I still do.  The frosting was out of this world good, fresh it was like creamy whipped marshmallows, after sitting covered in the fridge it has a consistency kind of like meringue.  So :yummy: .  The cake was lovely, perfect crumb, tall, light and tender, full of delicate flavors.  Thank you so much for another wonderful treat that reminds me of my childhood.  Made for Photo Tag"
542159,507398,2014/4/6,4,"Very pretty and very healthy but lacking excitement when it comes to taste. I made as written but think next time might try changing a few things such as cutting the zucchini into matchsticks instead of making ribbons with the vegetable peeler, increasing the dressing, using a hotter chili, either toasting the cashews or switching to peanuts and maybe adding just a tiny bit of ginger. Thanks for the post."
128473,512731,2014/5/2,5,"Thank you for sharing your recipe Homey.  I have had orange flavored french toast before, just never made this way.  It was a quick and easy recipe to make, with nice results.  The french toast was lovely, garnished with icing sugar and orange juice. The orange juice and icing sugar makes a nice subtle sweet topping that is not soggy.  I&#039;ll be making this again.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
2001563787,534945,2018/2/3,5,This could not be more simple and the outcome yummy. We are traveling in our rv so I had to make do with another frozen pizza brand. Worked out great. Make this for your game day and you will be a hit! BTW Can't wait to try this with other flavors like italian sausage and Italian flavors. Thanks again for this winner!
169430,498993,2013/5/16,5,"Pure fresh tasting goodness. Made using Splenda in place of the sugar so didn&#039;t need to boil the syrup, just mix blend and chill. Mine was cold enought for the ice cream maker in about 40 mins and then had reached soft serve stage (my favorite consistancy) in 20 mins. Really a lovely sorbet and so very good. :D"
461834,498993,2013/6/12,5,"Absolutely delicious and so refreshing during these hot days of summer!!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe, but now wish I had made the whole amount.  To me, it was the perfect blend of the citrus and sweetness of the strawberries.  I don&#039;t have an ice cream maker any longer(DH decided it wasn&#039;t used enough and threw it away), so I made the recipe as written, except I froze it, then added it to my mini food processor and then repeated this, and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this keeper.  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
2002255732,516208,2018/8/23,5,It’s was easy and delicious! Added ground beef and it was a hit!
2001551535,534954,2018/2/4,3,"I usually don't &quot;tweak&quot; the first time I try anything, but I would venture to say I would try one layer of brownie for fear the layers wouldn't get cooked. js"
2001219444,534954,2018/2/9,0,What kind of carbs and sugar content is there?
2001812074,534954,2018/2/11,0,Video isn't working
2001591280,534954,2018/2/11,4,I made this the other day and it was received very well. I am a purist with brownies and baklava so I was a little hesitant to combine these two desserts. I think the chocolate is a little strong and competes with the delicate nature of the baklava. I did tweak this recipe significantly. Will I make this again? Maybe but I would tweak it again.
37449,493649,2013/4/3,5,"I scaled the chipotle way back, as I can&#039;t handle too much spice.  That being said, I loved the chipotle taste! Made for PAC event, Spring 2013."
204024,531631,2018/5/1,4,We really liked the combination of flavors. We added the sherry and used regular soy sauce with the added molasses. The mushrooms were an added bonus we don't usually find in fried rice. The one thing missing was enough salt.
1803127833,517877,2014/9/12,5,"I received a copy of Lindsey&#039;s original recipe from a local farmer&#039;s market &amp; made this salad a couple weeks ago, and we all loved this salad!  I also made the change that you did by cooking the beets before peeling....much easier method to cook them before peeling.  I simply peeled them off by rubbing the beets with my hands.  Thanks for sharing your adaptation online so I could easily share the recipe weblink with friends."
2324285,515345,2014/4/18,4,"This was pretty good and easy to make.  I thought the leftovers tasted WAY better the next day, because I guess the cooked shrimp had time to marinate.  I love spicy food, but all those chili peppers gave the masala a bitter flavor.  I&#039;d cut back on them next time."

2001362355,506850,2017/5/19,5,This was sooo good!i don't peel my potatoes to leave the vitamins from the peel with the mashed potatoes so mine weren't as pretty but loved the combo and all the additions to the potatoes.

Mine looked different from your photo too.. your photo does not show carrots yet when I made it... the carrots were very visable.  I really liked the idea of this recipe... but it was just too bland and soggy.... I will have to &quot;doctor&quot; it up and see how it comes out.  This recipe has potential."

1102578,497021,2013/3/30,4,"I had to make this recipe as it seems like there is a new review for it almost every day!  It was pretty good, but I was hoping for more based on the other 100+ great reviews.  I think this needs more liquid of some type, definitely some seasonings, and my potatoes were only half-cooked, so that was a bit disappointing.  Otherwise we enjoyed the recipe and would try it again with modifications.  Thanks for posting your recipe!"
140132,497021,2013/4/19,5,"This is so good.  I made this for my family and they loved it.  They said it tasted just like a runza.  I did screw up a bit from the recipe.  I forgot to add the soup mixture to the meat and cabbage before I put it on the bottom crust, so I just added it to the top of the meat mixture and then but the top crust on.  it turned out perfect.  My family didn&#039;t know any different and they loved the recipe.  Thank you for sharing, this is so much easier then making all the individual runzas.  You are a life saver!"
321820,497021,2013/5/23,5,"Very good, filling and easy! I used a great deal of pepper as we like spicy and some worcestershire sauce. Other than that followed exactly and enjoyed. Congrats!"
1800174055,497021,2013/12/4,5,"I just made this for dinner, and i&#039;ll admit i was skeptical. I made a few changes:&lt;br/&gt;-shredded my own cabbage and carrots&lt;br/&gt;-used diced parboiled potatoes and chopped onions in place of the simply potatoes&lt;br/&gt;-added garlic powder and salt and pepper&lt;br/&gt;-only made a top crust made from flattened biscuits instead of croissants &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the result was amazing.&lt;br/&gt;I loved the taste and will be making it in the future for sure!"
1972789,497021,2014/3/3,5,Very easy and tasty!  My husband thought it was a bit bland so I will try to spice it up a bit next time.
222478,496426,2013/4/20,5,Quick and delicious! The tang from the lemon juice / zest was great and the yoghurt helped make the lamb really tender. I served along with a Greek salad and tzatziki as suggested.
1620171,496426,2013/7/23,5,"This was lovely and easy to make. I couldn&#039;t get the lamb to come up looking grilled, I guess it just wasn&#039;t hot enough, but the meat was nice and tender and tasted wonderful. Made for ZWT 9 for the Tasty Testers."

42007386,513212,2014/10/7,4,"Looks good, but why do you have to refrigerate it though?"
1803276848,513212,2014/10/28,0,I would say it has to go in fridge because of the pumpkin....
1803475562,513212,2014/12/8,4,"I made this, but I used extra vodka instead of everclear to make is just vodka. It made A LOT. LOL. I just now fought about the expiration. How long is it good for???"
2351580,513212,2017/9/23,5,"This does make a lot, but you're going to need a lot once everyone gets a taste! Kept it in the fridge in mason jars. It was absolutely incredible mixed half and half with eggnog! We kept it for months. ( I hid some!)"

2902456,501060,2013/7/15,4,This was extremely easy to make. I added some of my own touches; made it in layers. I also included  coconut flakes in one layer and in another raspberry sugar free jello. Taste great.

2001413248,530480,2017/3/8,5,I made this tonight and it was very easy and good. I added some cinnamon to the apples as well and only used a 1/4 cup of honey. I will make this again.
107135,517577,2014/8/10,5,"i liked these just fine ,good side  for breakfast but  czech mr picky whose mom made these all the time  said, i didnt like them when my mom made them and these taste just like hers  , score , i think , anyway this is good recipe made for cakepops on parade  for russian leg  of tour"
128473,517577,2014/9/24,5,"Wow, these little pancakes tasted great.  I was a little nervous because the batter was so thin, but they firmed up nicely.  They had a lovely texture and a really nice flavor.  They were quick and easy to make with great results.  I served them with the sour cream mixture and strawberry jam, for a really nice contrast.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for Culinary Quest - 2014 - Family Picks - Suitcase Gourmets."
761979,519840,2015/5/20,5,"We greatly enjoyed this recipe, but I did make a few changes based on our preferences and what I had on hand.  I didn&#039;t use the red pepper or the crushed red pepper flakes, neither my daughter or I like things that spicy and she prefers raw to cooked peppers.  I also did no have chopped peanuts on hand (but I did use extra crunchy peanut butter instead), or lime wedges.  As I said the family greatly enjoyed this but we&#039;ll double the amount of sauce next time.   (For our preferences as I served it over rice and more sauce would have flavored the rice better."
1620171,498167,2013/5/20,5,"This was lovely. Although the recipe says green and red peppers though they aren&#039;t listed in the instructions. I opted to leave them out. The other thing is that I got nearly 10 meals from this dish, I may have converted measurements incorrectly but wow, lots and lots of food. We really enjoyed our trip to Algeria today. Made for My Food Oddessy."
2001532616,513786,2017/5/11,1,"I'm pretty sure the directions are wrong. 8 cups of liquid, not counting the half cup of oil for 2 cups of rice? It will never absorb that much. I made it with just the chicken broth and I'm still waiting over an hour later for it to not look like soup."
2597942,493136,2014/2/18,5,"I made this recipe last weekend... and I loved the simplicity. I am not a pastry person by any means, but this was easy enough for me to conquer. I did leave it sit for about 1 hour before using, and it seemed fine. I used the dough to make Recipe #484910 and it worked beautifully. Thank you for posting your recipe. (Made for PRMR)"

I ate two leftover biscuits for breakfast the next day: they heat up beautifully in the microwave in just 20-30 seconds. My one issue with them is they are BIG. Eat one of these and you won't have room for dessert. Would be fabulous for a brunch dish, or a vegetarian main dish."
107135,504772,2013/8/5,5,easy peanut butter shake used a little ice cream instead of canned milk.if you like abba zabba bars this is for you zwt9
2000185658,504772,2015/5/5,2,"More of a peanut smoothie than peanut punch. Peanut punch usually includes nutmeg,vanilla, and evaporated milk. Kinda lose the heart and real taste of the drink without those things."
1742738,519842,2014/12/3,5,Made as directed but cut sugar to 1/2 cup.  Served for a lunch gathering today and I could have gotten away with not washing the baking dish.  All Gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

286566,505429,2013/10/18,5,"I did have to sub some ingredients and used sultanas for raisins, pecans for the almonds and my saffron had disappeared so used some turmeric and scaled back for 2 serves and 3 of us ate up the lot and thoroughly enjoyed.  Thank you Chef PotPie, made for Healthy Choices tag game."
2002092971,521472,2018/4/2,5,"My husband really enjoys fettuccine, and he loves this recipe."
220348,495345,2013/3/1,5,"Wow! Talk about zingy! At first I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but it turned out really well. I didn't find any of the ingredients overpowering, although I'm kind of glad that the vodka wasn't too strong, in this drink."
80353,495345,2013/3/2,5,Oh yeah.  I'll have another.   Zingy - perky - perfect.  Who'd have thought?
1706426,495345,2013/9/18,4,"Good, but a bit too spicy for me! LOL! Congrats on you football win!"
560491,493838,2013/3/27,5,Great bread!  I always have these ingredients on hand so it can be made on a whim.  It was the perfect moistness and sweetness.  I used walnuts and it gave it a nice texture.  Made for Spring 2013 PAC.
381180,493838,2013/9/5,5,"Delicious banana flavor; moist inside crumb, and a crusty sweet exterior crust.  Made with butter, four small (1 1/2 cups) mashed bananas (previously frozen), and 3/4 cup toasted pecans. Baked in a metal pan for 45 minutes.  My house smelled heavenly while the banana bread baked! Tagged for PRMR, due 09/05/13"
386585,493838,2013/10/7,5,"We are big banana bread fans, and I make it quite frequently.  However, for the past few months, I&#039;ve been trying combinations such as zucchini-banana, coconut-banana, etc.  It was nice to rediscover good old banana nut bread again!  This was so easy to make, too!  I wasn&#039;t sure about  how the butter was supposed to be (softened, melted, etc.), so I did a combination of both in the microwave.  This made a nice sized loaf that took about 55 minutes to bake.  Thanks for bringing me back to basics!  Made for PRMR tag game."
169430,493838,2013/10/12,5,You just can&#039;t go wrong with a classic like this. It made a very well shaped loaf with a perfect moist texture. I cut the sweetness to 3/4 cup of Splenda which worked very well for me and used 3 bananas as mine were all pretty small. Used walnuts chopped small to really spread them around. Final result?: Total yum!
383346,493838,2013/11/7,5,This bread has a great taste.  I used only 3/4 cup of sugar but it&#039;s a bit too sweet for us.  Next time I&#039;ll use only 1/2 cup.  I omitted the nuts.  I cooked it 60 minutes.  Thanks nochlo :)  made for PRMR tag game
39835,493838,2014/2/13,5,Very good - I made a small loaf and a mini loaf. We skipped the nuts but otherwise made as directed. Easy and good! Thanks for sharing!
1802542398,493838,2015/3/6,5,perfect
486725,498847,2014/10/4,5,"Wonderful pizza, with tons of flavor from all the different ingredients. We only added half the chicken, and vegetarians could easily leave it off and still have a very satisfying meal. The other alterations we made for personal preferences were omitting the sugar and using only feta cheese (but at double the amount)."
738401,503436,2013/11/23,5,"Super!  I made this a few days ago with the thyme and loved it!  I was looking for cheap seedless grapes to make it again.  I knew that grapes could be roasted and what great flavor they had.  I served with roasted chicken to sweeten things up a bit.  Thanks for posting, Ambervim, I absolutely love this idea!!"
440735,503598,2013/9/5,4,The salsa was great!  I used about 4 hot pickled jalpenoes; it was spicey.  As for as the patties I feel like they needed more flavor.  I did not change anything on the recipe.  I was trying to think what else could be added to get more flavor but didn&#039;t come up with anything.  Any ideas?  I would like to try these baked to lower the calorie count. Made for the Gourmet Goddesses July 2013.
2703476,495219,2013/2/20,5,Very delicious!!!!!!!
1052873,502870,2013/8/11,5,Very flavorful and a good tenderizer. Good amount for one cut-up fryer. Made for ZWT.
2001310510,499071,2016/12/21,5,Made this tonight as a trial run for Christmas Eve. My husband and son loved it and gave the green light to serve for the holiday. I used beef broth and added a beef bouillon cube to the broth. Great to have a gravy that doesn't require the drippings. Lots of flavor and a keeper.
2002181957,506889,2018/7/12,0,"If using sourdough, refresh your starter with equal weights flour and water. you'll need 182 g of starter. Sorry can you elaborate on this point. Thanks."
1803650388,520430,2015/1/12,5,This recipe is absolutely fantastic and so easy to make! I could not find spinach linguine where I live so I used regular linguine. My husband and I loved it!
482376,513201,2016/10/5,5,"Excellent wings! I put this into my Best of 2016 file. These baked wings had a crisp exterior and the sauce flavor was excellent. We also really loved the dipping sauce! I'm allergic to blue cheese, so never serve my wings with that. I used the creme fraiche/feta cheese option and omitted the cilantro. The flavors of everthing together were perfect. Even my son commented on how the flavors complemented each other. Thank you!"
865936,495309,2013/3/1,5,This was oddly addictive. I could not stop eating it; good thing I only made 1 portion!  I would make this again for a healthy snack.

50509,496252,2013/3/16,4,"Quick dinner tonight. I used my preferred method to make the tofu cubes -- I sliced the block into three flat slices placed on a paper towel, covered with another one, then another plate and then some weights. Because things came up, this stood for about 3 hours. I then cubed the slabs and dredged them in cornstarch. The cubes turned into lovey brown nuggets - crispy on the outside and hardly there inside - an ephemeral creaminess. Mr Grumpy did not recognize it as tofu. I did end up using the full quantity of the sauce - do remember to stir it before throwing it in the pan - the cornstarch will settle as it stands. Also, I used just a fraction of the soy sauce, and the sauce was salty enough for us.  Instead of broccoli, I used a frozen mix of Asian vegetables, on which I drizzled a touch of sesame oil. Quick to make once the tofu is pressed."
37449,496252,2013/3/29,5,"This was so good with the steamed broccoli. I was out of cornstarch, so used flour to thicken the sauce. Thanks! Made for PRMR game."
107583,496252,2013/4/24,5,"I have always been ambivalent about tofu, but this recipe made a convert.  Tasted just like the chicken version I get at the local take-out.  And really was easy to make.  I might up the &quot;heat&quot; factor next time with more sambal oelek."
285039,502544,2013/8/11,5,One of the best waffle recipes I have ever made ... and the dutch honey is sinfully good!
461834,502544,2013/12/7,5,"I love waffles and these didn&#039;t disappoint me!!  I really enjoyed how bubbly they were from the yeast and baking powder, after sitting in the fridge for over 8 hours.  I tagged these planning to make them right away, as I thought I had all ingredients on hand.  But upon opening my dried milk powder canister, the milk was in one big cake, FL weather, ugh!!!  So then I kept forgetting to pick up some more of the milk powder and then by the time I did, I had finished using the heavy cream for another recipe.  So I decided to go ahead and make the waffles and just used regular syrup this time.  I made 1/2 of the recipe and it makes quite a bit of waffles.  Great way to plan for breakfasts for the holidays or when having guests visiting.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for your win (3rd win, wtg) in the football pool!!!! :)"
242766,502544,2013/12/11,5,"I loved the convenience of making the batter the night before so all I had to do in the morning was fire up the waffle iron.  I had never made waffles with yeast so I expected them to have a yeasty flavor, but they didn&#039;t.  They were light, fluffy and really delicious!  In fact, after his first bite, my husband declared that they were his new favorite waffle.  We loved them served with the Dutch honey, even though I had to make a couple of changes.  I went to the cupboard to get my maple syrup and found that I was all out.  I ended up using maple pancake syrup instead.  Because pancake syrup is so much sweeter than maple syrup, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I probably could have omitted the sugar altogether because it was plenty sweet.  I can&#039;t wait to try this with real maple syrup.  This recipe makes a lot (I got 30 4&quot; waffles), so I froze the rest to enjoy later. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper!  **Made for 2013 Football Pool**"
1783373,502544,2017/6/20,5,"These waffles are delicious and we enjoyed them for Father's Day. I love that it is based off of a yeast dough. It has a great crumb and consistency. I added a couple of tablespoons of sugar to the batter and next time I will add some vanilla extract to add another level of flavor. Otherwise, they were perfect. I also liked the maple honey syrup as it made it very interesting. The father of the day loved it too! Thank you Breezer for sharing. Made it for FYC tag game on yuku."
169430,506062,2013/9/3,5,This is a very good compound butter. Takes just minutes if you don&#039;t feel the need to get fancy making a butter roll (I didn&#039;t). Tried it out on Recipe #250694 for a heavenly treat. Thanks for sharing Kerfuffle. :D
128473,536679,2018/8/25,5,"What a wonderful dessert. The croissant bread pudding was devine; light, tender, decadent and delicious. Thank you Nif for sharing this lovely recipe. We loved it. Made for Susie's World Tour - Cajun/Creole"
498271,503684,2013/7/19,5,"Delicious chicken dish!  I always have those little grape tomatoes on hand this time of year so I used those instead of the romas, otherwise made as directed.  The chicken/orzo/veggie mixture was tasty on its own the the lemon/mint drizzle and yogurt/cuke sauce added another punch of flavor.  Really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
12990638,506245,2013/12/30,4,Makes a delicious muffin worthy of a special breakfast or brunch or just to have on hand for a family. I used dairy-free yogurt &amp; butter as well as 2 cups of fresh cranberries to replace the dried ones and they came out really very well. There is no gritty aftertaste and the texture is perfect. My only comments otherwise are that part of the recipe could be re-ordered (put the oj &amp; oats first as it takes time) and that the recipe calls for more special equipment than I usually bring out for muffin making.  Will make these again!
2000492778,508389,2015/9/23,5,"Very tasty! I changed it up a bit, left out the meat and added more rice instead and used soup powder instead of ketchup. Comfort food indeed! I added it to my recipe collection."
2738357,493388,2013/3/15,5,This prize winning recipe is an original recipe created by my daughter and I for the 2007 National Beef Cook-Off and is part of the Beef Check Off program.  It is great for families to make together in the kitchen! We wanted to acknowledge the source for gailanng and hope you enjoy it!!
865936,517530,2014/8/21,5,We thought this was great even though we did not load it up with lots and lots of toppings.
1379390,513125,2016/5/12,5,"This is an usual casserole. It is sort of a baked chicken and dumplings but with a big yummy, buttery dumpling. I am not sure what I expected... perhaps that it would be bland or watery, but it was neither of those things. It was delicious and comforting and just the thing for a winter evening. I did make two changes... doubling the topping and using half the amount of salt. The ratio of topping to filling was perfect and it was a hit all around. Thank you for the great recipe!"
227978,515660,2014/11/14,5,"This was Fabulous!  It was given high praise even by my family members who don&#039;t usually care for pork.  And it&#039;s so quick to prepare, and it results in such a delicious and moist roast. The fresh dill added such a nice touch, but I think the honey-mustard glaze contributed the most heavenly flavor.  It made a very lovely and enticing presentation too, with the fresh herb crust making the loin roast appear restaurant quality.  Thanks for another &quot;keeper&quot;, Nancy&#039;s Pantry.  Made for the &#039;For Your Consideration&#039; tag game."
1803558733,503799,2014/12/25,5,"I cooked the pernil as directed. It came out so delicious, just the way my mother used to make it. I will be preparing it this way for every Christmas Eve. It is a tradition for us. Thank you."
2000180501,503799,2015/5/2,1,Soy does NOT belong in a pernil recipe!

2001899037,503799,2017/12/30,5,"I never leave reviews, but signed up just to comment! This was by far the best pernil I have ever made. I cooked it a little differently time wise, but the marinade was out of this world."
2001902093,503799,2017/12/31,5,In the oven right now. House smells so gooooooooooood!

145352,517878,2014/8/21,5,This was simple and delicious! And I loved that it was so healthy!! Made for CQ 2014.

314579,517878,2014/8/22,0,"I&#039;m already a quinoa fan.  This was fabulous and it&#039;s own and I think a great &quot;staple&quot; to have made up in the fridge to eat on it&#039;s own or as an addition to fish tacos, or to other latin flavored salads!  Thanks sofie!!!!  made for Culinary Quest 2014 Int&#039;l Agents of Quest."

2002272874,503799,2018/9/12,5,This is the only way I make it now especially when my co workers request it for potluck! I put it in the oven and go to bed and wake up to the whole house smelling delicious and the most tender fall apart pernil!!!????????
895132,492976,2013/1/21,5,"What a wonderful dish! I've never made chicken this way, and I'm glad I did now. It was even better the next day. Made it with the suggested spice mix. Thanks for sharing!<br/>Made for Visit Oman / NAME Forum"
280271,507321,2014/4/19,5,I&#039;ve made this twice now...and both times I haven&#039;t been disappointed...this is like the most basic potato skin recipe...you can really add onto it..the ingredients are unlimited...but I just used the basic&#039;s...I followed the recipe...but just added a touch more bacon on top for extra color and flavor...I can see adding some spicy salsa...thanks for posting the recipe...Made for Spring 2014 PAC...=)
45544647,505226,2014/3/9,5,Creamy with a crunch and a kick.

2001805221,505226,2017/11/19,5,Great recipe! It was delicious.
2702136,495674,2013/2/19,5,This receipe is delicious and practical in gathering the ingredients. All of the ingredients have a gourmet zest yet can be easily founded in the supermarket. It is also very different from your average flatbread pizza. <br/>It is also very easy to prepare and does not take a lot of time. <br/>It is one of my favorites!
2705696,495674,2013/2/22,5,"This is an interesting twist. I have quite a discerning palate and this pizza touched upon the sweet,sour and definitely savory.<br/>For someone who normally orders takeout and doesn't cook a whole Lot I think this will definitely be my ""go to"" pizza"
107583,505029,2013/8/26,5,The hardest part about this recipe was peeling the shrimp!  Everything else was quick and easy and the result was wonderful.  I skipped the rice and served this as an appetizer.  Made for ZWT 9.
381180,505029,2013/10/12,4,"Very easy ~ Loved the lime!  I made a half recipe as an appetizer, and it was a bit too hot, and a little salty, as written, for my tastes.  Next time I&#039;ll reduce those amounts ~ definitely worth making again!  Tagged for Rookie Recipe tag ~ due 10/24."
2001254468,529063,2016/11/19,5,These are without doubt the very best Burgers that I have had anywhere! They were juicy and didn't fall apart like some without breadcrumbs. Got to make some more this weekend! Can't recommend them enough!!
280271,503453,2014/10/30,5,I really wasn&#039;t sure how to rate this...with that said...this is a touch of Heaven in your mouth...that&#039;s why the 5 stars...now I&#039;m not a cookie lover...I made these for the hubby and I had all the ingredients...the recipe was very easy to put together...just remember to add the oil later...it took my cookies 30 minutes cooking at 300 degrees before they were starting to creak...I&#039;m still not really sure they came out the way they were suppose to...but they sure were tasty...they never got really brown...and the bottoms were just turning golden when I took them out of the oven...I was able to get 24 cookies from the recipe...I cooked half while the other half hung out in the frig ready to hit the heat...I made this &quot;For your consideration&quot; tag game...=)
425105,503453,2018/1/28,5,"Fabulous cookies. They really do melt in your mouth. I based just for 15 minutes and am glad I didn't bake them longer as they came out slightly moist when still hot, but perfectly crumbly when cool. I cut the recipe down to 1/3...and made 15 cookie (plus ate enough batter to probably make another 3-4 cookies)."
2001594588,535431,2018/5/25,0,Why the sugar? That confuses me.?
7465402,535431,2018/5/25,0,"I'd like to know, too; why sugar? This is supposed to be savory."
2000961776,535431,2018/5/25,0,"I'd love to ry this, but the sugar makes it impossible for me because I'm diabetic. Can I substitute 1 Tbl stevia, or not sweeten it at all? Why the sugar?"
2002155568,535431,2018/5/25,0,your r&eacute;cipes are first difficult to find and are not well explained.I don't like your recipes
1803603670,520307,2015/1/3,5,Looks really good
1925885,504956,2013/8/11,5,"Yum, yum!  This is a most excellent coffee drink!  I made two, one for me and one for DH.  He almost didn&#039;t get his...  :)"
284897,504956,2013/8/12,5,"I used decaf espresso, and I also made 2, and DH didn&#039;t get his! Wonderful coffee, creamy, smooth and ohh so yummy!Thanks evelyn, wonderful recipe."
47892,504956,2013/8/12,5,"Oooh, yummy! I subbed homemade whole milk frozen yogurt, dark roasted Sumatra coffee beans from a local coffee company and Cruzan spiced rum for Tia Maria. Rich coffee with smooth and creamy dairy! Can&#039;t beat that!  Didn&#039;t share. ;) Made for ZWT/Express Weekend #2."
496803,504956,2013/8/12,4,"I used some homemade vanilla bean ice cream, and premium coffee. The ice cream was sweet enough that I skipped the sugar.  Oh, yum!  A great dessert for any coffee lover on a warm evening!"
695933,508914,2013/11/5,5,"A easy recipe to do as is and very good, It make me think of a German Dip. The bavarian dip is a delicious dip if I made with liverwurst and sour cream. Flavored with pickle relish, the bavarian dip is mixed together and and can be chilled if desired before serving. This is a German Beer Cheese Dip Maybe I missed it, but should there be beer in the recipe? How else does it become a &quot;hoppy, malty, creamy dip?&quot; 1/4 cup German lager beer, such as Beck&#039;s. Saute the onion for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Then remove from heat and drain. O.K. You got me thinking?? I can play with my food this time! Got to go do the happy food dance!! NOW !!..THANK YOU for the DANCE and as will for the recipe.....Happy Cooking to you ...I now have two or three ways to do this dip....Party Time....Party....Party....PRMR 2013....Grpa"
226867,508914,2014/1/1,5,This was great - all my guests loved it! It was equally good on party rye and triscuits!
2001563787,535431,2018/5/26,5,Well the force was with me when I saw this but alas I have no mold. I whipped it up for breakfast anyway. I just broiled some freshly shredded cheddar over the top when it was done for a great cheesy finish. It was definitely a winner but I would cut the sugar (subbed Splenda for my diabetic hubby) because it was just a tad too sweet for our taste. I do like how the sweetness adds a nice contrast to the salty cheese and ham though. Next time I will make this into muffins to serve at breakfast or as an accompaniment to soup or salad. Thanks for sharing. May the force be with you!
2001569139,535431,2018/5/27,0,I found the mold (for ice) on Amazon &amp; plan to get it since we’re big Star Wars fans. It looks really small so I plan to make varieties using different cheese besides cheddar (Swiss &amp; pepper Jack).
227978,493320,2013/7/17,5,"These are so refreshing and quite delicious.  It&#039;s a nice creamy cocktail without a heavy &quot;boozy&quot; taste.  We really enjoyed them so much that we&#039;ve had them 2 nights in a row now.  I didn&#039;t have any half-n-half so used light cream both times, and I think it was just fine.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, lazyme.  Made for ZWT9 - Cajun/Creole."
135470,493320,2013/7/20,4,"This drink was tasty and refreshing but didn&#039;t really tasted like a Ramos Gin Fizz but more like a slightly creamy Tom Collins. I missed the traditional orange water and the egg white, and in my book these should be shaken not blended but here&#039;s to progress :) Made for ZWT 9 by one of the Appliance Killers."
852554,493320,2013/7/24,4,"I love gin and wanted to try one of these for years, but it just seemed to be missing something.  Again, this is the first one I ever had, and I must say, with the blender it was easy! I used half and half and Bombay Sapphire Gin. Made for ZWT 9"
451319,493717,2016/10/27,5,Seems pretty much the same as the way I make it. First had this when I was a tree surgeon in Germany - came into my local bar chilled to the bone. One sip (took 3 attempts to get past the rum fumes wafting in my face) and I was feeling much better. Now it's my go-to concoction when I have a cold. A few friends have tried it and also reported amazing recoveries. Plus you take the best naps!
487245,493203,2013/1/8,5,"WOW!!! This stuff was so addicting! The broth was out of this world. The potatoes, sausage, and kale are a wonderful flavor and texture combination! I ended up using the real bacon pieces used for salads, and it was perfect and made it so simple. I've tried other versions of this recipe, but the quality ingredients with this one turned out with the best flavor. This one is definitely a keeper."
1800148786,493203,2014/1/2,5,Amazing! The flavors came together beautifully. Will make again!
1802205645,493203,2014/1/11,5,"I absolutely LOVE this soup!  Whenever I&#039;d go to Olive Garden, I&#039;d get two or three servings and then take my entree home with me because I&#039;d fill up on the soup (and bread, of course.)  I made a few changes for myself, using 2 pounds of sausage, 1 pound mild italian and 1 pound hot italian.  It adds an extra kick that I love.  It also tastes great without the cream if you&#039;re looking for a non-dairy version.  Will be making this OVER AND OVER again!"
1802222087,493203,2014/1/11,0,"I made this even easier in a slow cooker with less fat. Brown the sausage in a skillet, slice the sausage links in half, then slice into small pieces. Put in in the crock pot with the diced potatoes, onion, garlic, and 32 oz of low sodium chicken stock. Add water if needed just to cover. Cover and cook on high for 2-4 hours until the potatoes are done. Then add 2 tblspoons of flour to 1 cup of half and half (instead of heavy cream), whisk to break up any lumps, add to the pot along with the kale and bacon and simmer about 3 minutes until thick. Add salt &amp; pepper and red pepper (I used ground but flakes would work too) to taste and serve. Even me that isn&#039;t overly fond of soup loved it."
1802224248,493203,2014/1/11,0,"Omg, this recipe is exactly the same as Olive Garden restaurant. I never thought it would taste the same. I first made it for Christmas Eve dinner and it was amazing. Thank you so much for the recipe.&lt;br/&gt;Yelisa Morales,Florida"
1942108,493203,2014/1/16,5,I did add about a tsp of basil and a dash of smoked paprika when browning the sausage but otherwise I followed the recipe. Very good! Love the heat. The broth is rich and yummy on a freezing cold day in MN.
1801613244,493203,2014/1/31,5,"We crave this soup!  It IS better than Olive Garden&#039;s.  We double the recipe and enjoy it for two to three days.  We&#039;ve even eaten it for breakfast.  Thanks, Mr. Comer."
890766,493203,2014/4/15,5,"This was amazingly good. My family loved it! Followed the recipe exactly and now I can save money by making the soup, instead of spending my money at olive garden to get my soup fix!"
1802955701,493203,2014/7/22,5,"Made this exactly as written and it was really good.  Wished I would&#039;ve put in more than four potatoes.  Not the best for mid-July, but I will definitely be making it again this fall.  Yumm!"
1803105574,493203,2014/9/5,5,I made this for a beading party and the ladies loved it. Never mentioned it was an Olive Garden copycat.  It was simple to make and delicious.
1242099,493203,2015/2/3,5,"Just delicious!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My kids ate it (I think the younger ones didn&#039;t love it... like almost everything).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My DH loved it!  We will definitely make this again.  Next time I make it, I&#039;ll brown the bacon separately... I not a big fan of un-crisp bacon even though it still may add flavor... I guess it&#039;s a texture thing.  The broth is soooo delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
2000112597,493203,2015/4/3,5,I tried this soup a few weeks ago at the Olive Garden. Went back twice and ordered some to go. Then I found this recipe online. This is absolutely the perfect recipe!  I&#039;m adding a little more kale and bacon next time - that&#039;s to suit my personal taste. Thanks for the recipe!
2000151960,493203,2015/4/24,0,"Soup is delicious. However, you may want to cut way down on the ground pepper flakes."
2000257776,493203,2015/6/9,5,Oh. My. Gosh!!! Absolutely amazing!! My husband said it tastes better than Olive Garden! This is so delicious I will definitely make and make again. Thank you :-)
2000321784,493203,2015/7/7,5,"This was absolutely amazing!! So delisious!!first time making this and it came out so yummy! Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again!!!"
2000375351,493203,2015/7/31,5,"This recipe is awesome, a few changes/notes make excellent and spot on. I halved the hot peppers and instead of using bacon bits I minced 2 slices of bacon. Don&#039;t worry about crisping, just cook through. One important note: wipe out your pot after cooking the sausage and drain your sausage well to avoid discoloring your soup and messing with the &quot;restaurant quality&quot; flavor!!"
2000410271,493203,2015/8/17,0,Too salty.
2000444460,493203,2015/8/31,5,AMAZING soup!!!! Made this one night last week and my husband is making me make it again this week. Very easy recipe to follow and very flavorful!!!! My husband does not eat leftovers but he definitely are this the next day for lunch. The best part is most the ingredients I already have in my house so it doesn&#039;t require a costly grocery bill to make. Hope you enjoy it like we did!
2000597191,493203,2015/10/26,4,"I halved the sausage, halved the pepper flakes and subbed ham (cause I was out of bacon) and used half and half vs. cream to drop the dairy level a little and I can live with it  :)  taste great !"
2001274168,518120,2016/11/28,5,"When my granddaughter visits we bake bread together, and we tried this recipe. We all decided that this is the most delicious bread we have ever made . No more store bought bread....I will continue using this recipe and baking my own ."
486725,504049,2015/1/13,5,"Caramelizing brussels sprouts gives them such a great flavor, and the bacon enhances that here. I accidentally doubled the bacon - made a half recipe and thought I had one slice, when two were stuck together (but it definitely wasn&#039;t too much bacon). The avocado is really unique in this. I have to admit though, I topped the plates with it room temperature, as we are not big fans of warmed/cooked avocado. It was a wonderful side dish!"
2001959059,504049,2018/3/28,5,"One of my favorite recipes - I love this twist with the garlic and red pepper. Don't forget - the lime is ESSENTIAL. I also recommend using cast iron, but that's just me!"
128473,500913,2016/11/6,5,"Awesome recipe Miss Fannie. I enjoyed this delicious dish very much. It was quick and easy to make with excellent results. This dish is the best comfort dish, very very satisfying. Thank you for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy again and again. Made as written, except for the breadcrumbs use soft rather than dried, (personal preference only) Made for What's on the Menu Tag Game."
226863,510188,2013/12/19,5,"Very easy recipe, and the garlic really turns mild in the sauce.  I had to double the recipe even though I was cooking for two, as DS eats more than most people.  I did remove the skin before cooking....personal preference.  Don&#039;t be afraid of the garlic....it is very mild flavored.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag game."
1728850,510188,2014/5/26,5,"We&#039;re not chicken eaters but loved this dish because flavor is not sweet, especially loved by my fussy hubby who doesn&#039;t like most sweet flavors.  So easy to prepare and tastes so delicious.  There&#039;s a slight gariic smell but it adds much flavor to the dish.  Glad that I found this easy, simply delicious recipe!   And thanks much for sharing!"

216999,505793,2013/8/21,5,This is my favorite dessert at my local Thai restaurant and now I can make it at home!  Very good and easy to make.  The salt gives it the right taste.  This is a keeper and is going into the favorites file! Made for Pink Panthers on the Prowl for ZWT9.
47892,505793,2013/10/1,5,I love this dessert (because I love rice!)  and the first time I tried it in an Asian restaurant I went about to learn how to make it. I used white and black sesame seeds for color and instead of fresh mango I used local peaches. Salt adds that wee bit of balance which I approve. Yum! Reviewed for Make My Recipe Downunder. Thank you!
266635,505772,2013/8/15,5,This is a great tomato dish and a great way to cook with fresh tomatoes.  Love the spice along with the sweet brown sugar -- it makes a really nice contrast of flavors.  The cilantro was a great addition and you can never have enough cilantro in our opinion. We halved the recipe and served it along side a grilled Moroccan salmon.  What a great dinner we had tonight!  Made for ZWT9-N. Africa - Morocco &amp; Tunisia.
29196,493379,2013/3/2,4,"This was good and very easy to make, but part way through eating, we both decided it was too much acid (yoghurt, lemon juice, olives) that needed a couple of teaspoons of honey in there to balance things out.  We then decided the sauce would be perfect with lamb chops. Thanks for posting"
2549237,505772,2013/8/21,5,"We loved these tomatoes!  They are a nice spicy, sweet side dish or condiment.  We used these like ketchup on your Recipe #505755 and everyone loved them.  My son and daughter asked if I would make the &quot;ketchup&quot; for burgers everytime I make them now.  That is a sign of a sure winner.  Thanks Nif.  Made for the Moroccan and Tunisian round of ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers."
1745502,505772,2013/8/23,5,A nice variation on a sauce. Good flavor medley. I had it on eggs and potatoes. I can imagine it&#039;s fantastic on hamburgers.
174096,505772,2013/8/25,5,"Such a good tomato dish!  There are tons of flavors in here, and they really made the tomatoes pop!  Thanks for sharing.  ZWT9"
2001716153,509806,2017/9/16,0,"It is a very good recipe. My mom's recipe uses ketchup instead of tomatoes, no cheese with salt and pepper to taste instead of seasoning salt. Also I do use one egg to help the meatloaf to bind better. And I also chop up maybe a stalk or two of celery. Once the meatloaf is near completed, I always put a good amount of ketchup on the top. Both recipes make great leftovers!"
1800363810,509806,2018/6/9,5,"Wonderful recipe!!! I have made several times and its always a hit. Only thing i do different is use a glaze, equal amounts of brown sugar &amp; ketchup. Everyone loves my meatballs and I dont use bread, eggs or milk in them either. To me makes the texture yucky. I dont get why everyone puts the not needed fillers in meatloaf &amp; meatballs. I have never had any issues with either falling apart. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!! I had been wondering if I made a meatloaf without the fillers like my meatballs if would work and found your recipe. So glad I did!!"
37449,508489,2013/11/3,4,A nice mild sweet tea. I used soy milk with it. Thanks!
482376,493398,2013/1/28,5,Delicious! I was surprised by how much I loved the fennel in this recipe. It was absolutely delicious with the carrots. The chicken is nice and tender and the sauce is very flavorful. I served this with rice and it made a complete meal. Yummy!
1800052629,501253,2013/9/9,4,Just made this... Very easy and fun!
82296,501253,2014/7/15,4,"I&#039;ve seen recipes for this all over, but didn&#039;t save any, so I was glad to find this on Food.com.  I made it and boy was it trial and error.  I didn&#039;t slice the bananas before freezing.  Mistake number one.  They were so hard to chop.  It came out rather gooey, so I froze it.  I was surprised at the texture.  It was still good after freezing.  However, the taste just didn&#039;t do it for me.  I ended up mixing strawberries in it, and a little pineapple, and then I liked it enough to eat it.  Not the recipe&#039;s fault, but I won&#039;t do this again."
2002118665,532968,2018/4/17,4,"This is decadently good with some high-quality vanilla ice cream, or better yet, an ultra-smooth gelato. My only complaint about the recipe is the units of measure. The choice of either &quot;US&quot; or &quot;Metric&quot; is offered, but the US format is rather bizarre as it gives amounts as a fraction of a pound. For instance, &quot;.33 lb.&quot;, instead of the standard amounts in cups, half-cups etc. I switched to &quot;Metric&quot; but that just gave me the number of grams for each ingredient. I do have a digital scale that can measure weight by grams or ounces but it needs a new battery. Thus I was reduced to using conversion websites and charts, doing a little math, and hoping for the best. My point, and I do have one, is that while the rest of the world waits for the US to catch up, until we go metric our recipes will continue to need the measurements stated in cups, teaspoons, etc, as they always have been since at least the 1700s. (I once saw pages from a diary of George Washington's cook, circa 1776, that contains a number of recipes, all including what are now the US standardized amounts, measured in cups, tablespoons, etc.) Other than the convoluted measurements, for which I'm subtracting a star because it really was a pain, this is a mighty tasty recipe and I highly recommend it. Enjoy!"

266635,527468,2016/8/4,5,This jerk pork tenderloin was so easy to make and so flavorful. Loved the mango salsa as well. Made this pork to go with potato salad and spicy coleslaw. It made a wonderful dinner last night.

424680,507938,2013/12/27,5,"Made this pretty much as given in the recipe, but did use 1/3 cup each of green pepper and red pepper, which meant I used a bit more bell pepper than called for in the recipe! It still made for a wonderful tasting cheese spread, one that I&#039;d be happy to make again, for sure! [Made and reviewed in Everyday Is a Holiday]"
2866194,506768,2014/1/31,5,"I love this!  It has become my go-to dinner when I am in a rush or don&#039;t have time to go grocery shopping.  I love that it uses ingredients that I always have on hand, and it is super fast and easy.  I love making it with hot salsa and extra garlic!  Yum, thanks for posting!"
1900301,494063,2013/7/17,3,"I was looking for something different to make with fresh-from-the-garden cucumbers.  I was a bit shy to try this because there were no other reviews.  This wasn&#039;t the best egg salad in the world, but it was a pleasant change.  I didn&#039;t have shallots so I opted for yellow onion.  The egg salad was refrigerated for one hour to allow flavors to settle.  We enjoyed the cucumber crunch and their flavor wasn&#039;t overwhelming.  Their bulk stretched the servings to what you&#039;d normally expect with a dozen eggs.  Leftovers didn&#039;t do well because the cucumbers watered down the mixture.  I&#039;ll make it again if we have an abundance of cucumbers to use."
2000150034,517451,2015/4/18,5,"Sir...I have to say you are a god damn genius! Best way to cook ribs without heating up the house with the oven... And a far more superior taste of course, thank you so much. I used a  26 inch charcoal grill with the coals all on one side of the grill so I wasn&#039;t cooking directly over the heat, the thermometer on my grill makes it totally awesome...had to add coals halfway through but I just love the taste of a charcoal grill. Again thanks for posting this recipe...badass!"
2002091005,517451,2018/4/1,5,"Oh my yum, made these for Easter and my husband dubbed them food porn ??"
2000435312,517451,2018/5/27,3,"In short, the recipe is NOT fail proof. For my first time making ribs, I chose the recipe because it looked easy, and of course “no fail”. I followed everything exactly, and the ribs came out cooked nicely, however they were doomed from the beginning — all we could taste was the cayenne. My wife (who is Mexican) and I love spicy food, but this was too much, she was only able to eat one rib, and I only 3. I had been worried about them coming out too garlicky because the whole yard smelled like garlic while they cooked, but I have no idea if it was too much garlic because the cayenne covered it. I know the recipe says the measurements are estimates, but I’ve never cooked ribs before, and I had no idea what “heavy”, “medium” and “light” meant, so I just measured and blended the spices as listed above, and evenly covered my entire slab on both sides with all of it. (Slab was 3lbs with a lot of meat on it). Pictures or a video would help illustrate the ideal spice rub amounts. I will try again with 1 tbs black pepper, 2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, and maybe 1 tsp or less of cayenne."
2002217506,517451,2018/7/14,5,"I was looking for an easy-to-make recipe for a gas grill. This seemed simple enough. I knocked it out of the park. I DID happen to use Sweet Baby Rays, as well as the spice/herb mixture exactly as listed, and the ribs were AMAZING. I can't wait to make them again."
440735,502440,2013/7/22,4,Yum!  I went light on the cajun seasoning for the kids but would keep it the same or add more next time; would also decrease the chili peppers because of increasing cajun seasoning. We love alot of sauce so I will double next time!  Made for ZWT9 Gormet Goddesses.

Winner!"

2597942,505860,2015/8/23,5,"I made these this morning to have with my omelet (as kind of a breakfast dessert). I thought the recipe was very good. I have a pic I will try to add later on. I used fresh berries, and they were yummy. I kinda suck at baking, but these worked well. I will definitely make these again.

2001429004,505860,2017/3/11,1,"I kind of hated the recipe. I'm not trying to hate, just tell you to look somewhere else. These muffins were WAY to bland and extremely dense. Muffins should be cakey and delicious, but these tasted like a good muffin that got squished. The problem is not that I didn't bake them enough, I tested them and no goop came off so I tried one but it tasted battery. I put them in for 2 more minutes, same thing. I kept going until they'd been in the oven a total of 36 minutes, at which point they burned but still tasted battery. I do NOT recommend this recipe."
227652,524456,2016/2/24,5,"Want to give these 5 stars simply for being compatible w/ my husband&#039;s very low carb, strict diet! And also for detailed instructions. This was my first attempt @ carnitas! I could only found a bone-in boston butt--something I&#039;ve never worked with. Cooking time was no prob, but shredding was. I had to pull it out, cut the meat away from the bone &amp; chop it, rather than shred it. I am thinking that next time I&#039;ll use more liquid to almost cover the meat, as the bottom part resting in the liquid was far easier to shred. Due to time, I could let it cool b/f shredding--that might have been part of the problem. I used the cooking liquid as instructed but had a hard time separating the fat from the liquid--so there was lot of splattering! I didn&#039;t let the liquid cook down completely b/c of the mess, but the meat crisped up very well still. To reheat, my husband thought he should spritz a little water on it to keep the meat from drying out. And the meal was a huge success, despite these issues! Will search a little harder for a boneless shoulder next time. Thank you!"
128473,503115,2014/5/2,5,"Wow, was this good.  So good that I made it two days in a row.  Once exactly as written, the second using homemade cantaloupe sherbet, because I ran out of vanilla ice cream.  They were excellent prepared both ways. I garnished with spiced whip cream for an afternoon delight.  Thank you so much for sharing this treat.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
169430,504597,2013/8/7,5,Let me start by saying that I have placed this recipe in two cookboks before even writin the review. Those two books are Favorites of 2013 and My All Time Fav&#039;s. This recipe tastes like gourmet fare but it&#039;s on a budget cost. I used salmon tonight but this will perfectly accept any fish or shellfish with equal grace and good taste. The single thing that I will alter next time is to make more sauce. It&#039;s so good that I just wanted everything drowning in it. No veggies were added to the casserole but I used roasted carrots and steamed broccoli as sides. Bravo and thank you for sharing this keeper. Made for ZWT 9 (this time)
228458,504597,2013/8/10,5,"I could just say &quot;ditto&quot; to Annacia&#039;s review :). This was a really tasty keeper of a recipe, and while it took a few extra minutes to prepare I would say the time was worth the end result. I used a cup of steamed broccoli in the mix and it was a great fit, though I can see many veggies working here. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
169430,514719,2014/5/27,5,"Wow, this is good! I made just one for my brekkie this morning and enjoyed it very much. No tiny tomato&#039;s in the house so I just chopped a regular one and had to use a pinch of dried thyme. Since the Doc&#039;s warned me off spinach because of the purine in it I have embraced kale. I must say that the hummus is, to me, the essential ingredient that pull&#039;s this together flavor wise and I would advise not to skip it. I think I&#039;ll do this again tomorrow morning. :D"
80353,503748,2013/7/20,5,"My husband loves tyrokafteri, so I made this for him.  It really hit the spot.  Just enough of a heat kick from the banana pepper.  A great meze."
679953,505184,2013/8/21,5,"This a nice dip that we enjoyed last night.  Made this as written, and the cumin brings out a nice zing to this.  We all enjoyed this with some tortilla chips.  Tagged and made for PRMR."
1803587962,520055,2014/12/31,5,Forget the takeout! This recipe took me to china town! Packed with flavor and the amount was perfect for four people. This is a 10 star Chicken recipe! I just added some tea to go with it.

The ingredients sounded like this would be a great recipe &amp; the house smelled wonderful. Taste - meh, wouldn't ever make again. Disappointed. I make a lot of cookies and usually happy with the results &amp; taste; these are a different story. Save yourself the expense &amp; time."
227978,501423,2014/9/6,5,"This was delicious.  The tangy red currant sauce was perfect spooned over the pork chops.  This is so easy to make too, yet it&#039;s packed with flavor.  It would be perfect for a dinner party.  I followed the recipe as written and didn&#039;t make any adjustments except opted for the broth (where it called for red wine or chicken broth).  Otherwise, I prepared it exactly as written.  Thanks, Nancy&#039;s Pantry.  Made for 2014 Culinary Quest (PNW)."
865936,501423,2014/9/7,5,I made this with red wine and the only change I made was to add a tiny bit of water because we like a thin sauce.  The red currant sauce his wonderful with the pork chops.
690623,501423,2014/9/20,5,These chops were a winner in this house.  I made the sauce with the wine option and will be making it again and again.  Next time I might add a bit of broth to thin the sauce just a tad.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014
482376,501423,2015/2/3,5,"Wow. I loved these pork chops a lot more than I thought I would. Something about the flavor combinations made this a winner. The sauce was tangy and really worked well with the pork chops, lemon and garlic. I cooked my chops in a cast iron pan and for a few minutes longer on each side (due to the thickness). Thank you!"

Used grape jelly instead of the pepper jelly, but I added some chopped jalapenos to the cooking jam to give some kick that the pepper jelly would have. Used a -not to sweet- BBQ sauce for the A1 (sorry, we do not like the stuff) and almond flour for the spinach instead of the rice flour. Everything was just delicious together, a pretty perfect sandwich!! YUM!"

I also modified the soup a bit and hope I did not take away from the intended taste.  I used organic chicken broth vs. water, left out the jalapenos, and the espozote leaves (I found them, but wasn&#039;t sure we would like them in the soup).  Otherwise, I kept to the recipe and instructions.  I would like to try this soup again when corn is in season as I think it would be even better.  Made for PRMR, March, 2013."
39835,494189,2014/1/11,3,"This is very spicy soup. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups water, only one jalapeno and skipped the epazote leaves and cilantro. I also used frozen corn. Served with corn bread. Thanks for sharing!"
2324285,494189,2014/1/14,5,"This is a very tasty, spicy light soup- almost like a mildly-flavored split-pea soup with a bit of heat.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I could not find Anaheim peppers so used Cubanelle peppers instead.  I loved the epozote leaves in the soup; I&#039;ve never cooked with the ingredient or even heard of it, but the strange and different flavor was just right for a corn soup.  Served with a bit of Cotija cheese on top and some sour cream."
1803284901,494189,2015/1/2,5,chili is the best! I&#039;ve made the soup in multicooker Redmond so lessened the time of cooking. The dish tasted really nice on cold winter evening!
199848,496137,2013/3/14,5,"I really loved this salad.  I used organic red and yellow heirloom tomatoes and was pleased with the result.

While I made the heart of your recipe (the cream cheese blend) as written, I did dress-up the presentation a bit to offer a greater variety of options &amp; then combined it w/another appy type open-faced sammie to make a dinner meal for Siggi &amp; myself. I used sliced sourdough, dark rye &amp; a dense brown bread w/a hint of sweetness that resembled molasses. I served the excess of the cream cheese blend on-the-side w/assorted crackers &amp; had 1 lonely bit of bread topped w/thin-shaved smoked trout.

131126,533250,2017/8/30,5,Super simple to make and made for a tasty treat. I used both melba toast and party rye squares. I liked the cream cheese mixture on both. The thin cucumber slices topped this off perfectly. Thank you for sharing this recipe!
47559,533250,2017/9/4,5,I really enjoyed this tasty treat for lunch. The spread was very easy to make and an excellent way to use some of the herbs in my garden. I served it on a Rye Crisp cracker and topped it with a slice of smoked Norwegian salmon and a few thin slices of cucumber. The salmon was rich and salty and the cream cheese and cucumber offset that beautifully. I will definitely enjoy this again. Made for CQ4.
486725,533250,2017/9/19,5,"One of my all time favorite cream cheese spreads. I used roasted garlic, and ate some with the cucumbers and some without any topping. Having them just plain allowed the subtle flavors to really shine! I highly recommend this."
131126,507450,2014/5/23,5,"I thought these were pretty and had a nice texture.  They were a little too sweet for us, but would be better paired with breakfast/ brunch instead.

Dry them, let them finish thawing and proceed with recipe.  I also cut down on the garlic salt so they will not be too salty.  This produces a very moist and nicely browned wing."
39835,502831,2013/9/19,5,These were great! I used chicken drumlets and skipped the cayenne pepper but otherwise made as directed. thanks for sharing!
869184,502831,2013/9/20,5,"These wings were very good! I added the flour in with the spices (the recipe does not state where to use it), since I had kids at the table I reduced the cayenne pepper to around 1/3 of a tsp. That was a mistake as I could not detect the cayenne at all. Next time I will add 2/3 tsp or the full amount. I added some dots of butter to the pan (was not sure if the butter should be melted or smeared on the pan). The butter adds a delicious buttery flavour and helps with the crisping. Next time I might also use some bread crumbs instead of some of the flour to get an even crisper, coarser crust. All this said - the wings are very very good!"
280271,502831,2013/11/4,5,Delicious! I cooked mine 20 mins turned and cooked another 15 mins...they were nice and crispy...what a big surprise...I was worried about the amount of flour...I really didn&#039;t think it would be enough to coat the wings...but that was another big surprise...there was even some flour mixture left over...I did add a touch of red pepper flakes for added heat...I decided at the end to use up the last of my hot wing sauce I had about 2 tbls left so I tossed the wings in the sauce for a very light coating and they held up well...kept their crunch...I cut the recipe down to 2 servings which gave each of us 5 pieces...plenty for a nice dinner...thanks for posting it...=)
695933,502831,2013/11/4,5,I Made this Brunch today. It was awesome but I added 1/4 cup Recipe#19023 #19023 chicken wing sauce and 1 teaspoon of onion powder. It turned out very good and it was so simple to do A big hit with everyone! Next time I would do differently is allow the chicken to marinate for a few hours before cooking. I also used this for drum sticks and they came out great and in the same amount of time. I also put some wing sauce on some after I took them out and that made them even better. We liked them with a sweet sauce better than a real tangy one.  Thank you! PRMR 2013....Grpa
128473,502831,2014/2/20,5,"Thank you for our new go to chicken wing recipe nochio.  Wow, were these little babies good.  We really enjoyed the heat, from the rub and then from  the sauce.  I used a buffalo wing sauce that was very complimentary to the rub.  These were quick and easy to make, you won&#039;t miss the fried element, the baked chicken, is simply perfect.  Tender, juicy and very flavorful.  Made exactly as written, wouldn&#039;t change a thing. Excellent plain or with sauce.  Made for Best of 2013.  Kudos to you for making it into my Best of 2014 Cookbook."
1803402419,502831,2014/11/24,5,Good
204024,502831,2015/2/2,5,These made a great snack for the SuperBowl.    I didn&#039;t use the Cayenne I can&#039;t take the heat.  MY DH would have liked the Cayenne.   Made for 2014 Favorites.
482376,502831,2015/2/2,5,"Excellent wing recipe. It has earned a spot in my best of 2015 file! I halved the recipe and cooked about 20 min. one side, 10 min. the other. I didn&#039;t toss it with any sauce and still thought the wings were excellent! Next time I might experiment with bbq sauce and hot sauce to see which version I like best between three. Easy recipe and soooooo good and crispy; with just the right amount of spice. Thank you!"
2001474491,502831,2017/4/6,5,By far the BEST chicken wings I have ever made! Even my 71 yr old dad and mom agree. Thank you marie!
610488,502886,2013/7/23,5,This is a wonderful dish! I would consider it the greek version of Chicken Cordon Bleu. The only thing I would change is to pump up the sauce a bit more. The chicken bouillon cube and water is more of a flavoring agent of the spinach and tomatoes and is kind of thin. I would add a little flour and make this a proper sauce (roux). I made this vegan as Recipe #504389 for ZWT 9 Soup - A - Stars!!!
1911882,522478,2015/9/9,5,This recipe makes the perfect chocolate chip cookie! Absolutely Delicious! Iv made these a few times I was out of corn starch so I decided to used instant vanilla pudding instead worked beautifully!
2002209114,535713,2018/7/5,0,"I love this dip, I eat it with Ritz crackers or Graham crackers. Without the fruit."
2324285,510362,2013/12/26,5,"Well these are just great, and I don&#039;t even like pierogi that much.  They take a while to make, but I enjoyed the process.  I ended up with about 40 pierogi, and gave half to my parents who devoured them.  They are Polish and love sauerkraut pierogi and potato &amp; cheese pierogi, but they never heard of combining the three ingredients together.  It&#039;s a winning combination- they&#039;re so much more delicious than any other pierogi that I&#039;ve had.  I served these with fried onions and and crispy fried bacon."
1706426,499391,2013/5/18,5,"Yum, so good! I couldn&#039;t find the plain Hormel corned beef, but subbed Hormel corned beef hash and it worked just fine.  I used my own bread for the breadcrumbs, let the crumbs dry for two days, then went ahead. I&#039;ll make them all and freeze unfried for unexpected company. Next time I will try using rye bread instead of white. Thanks for posting!"
369715,499391,2013/6/4,4,The whole family enjoyed these. I followed the recipe as written and we enjoyed these while watching a Nascar race. My family liked dipping them but I liked them plain.
266635,499391,2013/6/27,4,"Very tasty - I agree that they are good on their own without the dressing.  I followed the directions completely, but the balls just would not stay together.  We ate them with a fork and enjoyed them; however, I will freeze the balance of the balls and see if that helps when frying.  Made for PRMR, June, 2013."
695933,499391,2013/9/25,5,"These are great for parties and taste like little Reuben sandwiches, My son idea of using Triscuit Rye with Carraway crackers &amp; they were perfect in flavor. And you do have to all the water out that you possible can. I using a 3/4 - inch cookie dough scoop to make the balls I had about 32 tasty little morsels. Than I followed the directions completely. I  DID DO NOT over-crowd it, or the oil temp will drop, and you will end up with very greasy balls, I too put a sacrificial ball to go in at the start of the fry. Good TIP!! Thanks for posting!!!  I made for PLEASE  REVIEW MY RECIPE 2013 SEPT-OCT 2013..... Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to you-all!! Grpa  NOW it&#039;s party time!.....party!.....party!.....party!"
2001288370,499391,2016/12/8,0,Can these be done in an air fryer? Once fried can they be reheated in oven?
2881109,497736,2013/6/28,5,"I just made your oopies bread. This is the first time I have ever made the bread. Being that I am a bread LOVER I was a little lerry, WOW, I was amazed, it was delicious. This recipe will DIFFENENTLY go in my recipe file.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you"
2913442,497736,2013/7/23,3,"I just made this recipe exactly as written except for the psyllium husks which I couldn&#039;t find.  I wouldn&#039;t describe this as &quot;bread.&quot;  They were more like little cream cheese omelets.  I ended up reheating them and having them for breakfast, and they were fairly tasty--but bread?  No."
2918699,497736,2013/7/27,0,These are a perfect substitute for tortillas when making soft tacos. No carbs!
1802409741,497736,2014/1/25,4,I cooked these today and they were very good! They were like bread to me and a very acceptable substitute for bread :) Loved them and I will be making them a lot more !
1802455753,497736,2014/2/5,5,"Being very new to the LCHF diet, I was very pleased to discover this as I really was missing bread. The texture was a bit flaky/eggy like a omelette I found, so I added an extre TBS of Psyllium Husks, an extra tsp of baking powder and a bit more cream cheese and instead of putting them on a baking tray I placed them in a mini-greased tin. It came out perfect so even though I guess I modified it a bit, this recipe by itself is still beautiful and gave me a foundation to explore! :) Awesome!"
1802473507,497736,2014/2/9,2,"Not sure if I did something wrong.  They came out very crumbly and when I made a sandwich out of them using fat free mayo, the &quot;bread&quot; turned into a gummy mess that stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth.  Might have to experiment a bit more, or try a different version.  There was no taste to it, and it was nice to have something that resembled a sandwich as I have not eaten bread for many months.  That said, having a hard time with the texture."
2000260775,497736,2015/6/10,3,These are great but very easy to screw up.  I tried them 3 times before I got them right.  My mom told me the trick to it.  The key is to beat the egg whites until stiff.  The easiest way to do this is to use a blender or hand mixer and make sure YOUR EGGS ARE ROOM TEMPERATURE before breaking them and starting.  In my opinion this should be added to the instructions.  Using eggs fresh from the fridge I was not able to get this recipe to work correctly.
2000329211,497736,2015/7/10,1,"I&#039;m def not a new comer to baking, but these turned out terrible.  I have tried to make them off and on and they are never &#039;bisquits&#039;.  They were bland and messy. Too bad, I really like the idea of them."
2000347205,497736,2015/7/18,0,"These came out prefectly. We did not use psyllium husk.  They were very light,  fluffy,  and delicious.  Be sure to whip the egg whites until they are crazy stiff for best results."
2000404732,497736,2015/8/15,5,"Just made these with psyllium husks, they came out bang on perfect and I&#039;m not a baker at all!  Mine came out nothing like cream cheese omlettes as some have described, they came out and taste like choux pastry. Really nice"
2000562019,497736,2015/10/14,0,"I did a little twist on this recipe. I put a tsp of garlic powder and a tsp of onion powder, and I cooked it a little longer to give it a garlic bread crisp to it. I love it!!"
2000573247,497736,2015/10/17,5,"These are absolutely amazing! I love the texture and taste. They don&#039;t look like much but they were just what I needed.  I also added 2 teaspoon of flax meal for fiber. 

I also used some of these with some vanilla protein powder and pumpkin spice and stevia. They were good also. I will be making these again."
2000803415,497736,2016/1/6,5,Do I use whole psyllium husks or powdered?
277634,497736,2016/1/22,5,"Love it. I will say it&#039;s easy, and because the fiber isn&#039;t a necessity, it makes easy for people who don&#039;t have access to a large variety of products. I happen to have flax seed meal and I used that.  I was thinking of using toasted hulled hemp seed to add extra protein. Also I wonder how this will cook up in a waffle maker.  Has anyone tried this?"
2000276714,497736,2016/1/30,4,"I made this for my breakfast sandwich this morning. I not a real big bread eater but, when I want a sandwich, I definitely want to stay within my Low Carb diet. This bread was a wonderful substitute for regular bread. I think adding the Psyllium and Baking Powder helped with the texture. It was thin but, it held together until the very last bite."
2000850813,497736,2016/2/1,5,"Did 2 batches. One with psyllium husk (fine) and one without. After the bake time recommended I let them cool and turned over to dry the underside in a 150 oven for 10 minutes, as I found the base a bit to moist. Did mince on oopsie bread and I was amazed. The ones with psyllium husk were great. Awesome recipe...Thanks!!"
2001214717,497736,2016/10/21,0,"Well, I was hopeful but very disappointed. They taste bitter when they cooked and when I added the yoke and cheese to the egg white (mixed at room temperature), the mixture lost all volume. There is no indication to butter the pan before baking, and so I didn't and they stuck to my non-stick pan and didn't fluff up like the ones in the picture in spite of adding the baking powder. I might recommend using a chilled glass bowl to mix the egg whites and buttering the pan next time. I'll try again, but the recipe does need some clarification on these specifics."
2001673380,497736,2017/8/15,5,"This is an awesome and low-carb solution I have been seeking for years. I can't believe they are fluffy and light (great suggestion BTW Andrea M on the parchment paper). Used them to make a nice Oopsie Pizza: coated the tops with olive oil and garlic, a dab of marinara sauce, added sauteed veggies, with Andouille Sausage, and cheese ... Wonderful!!"
2001704777,497736,2017/9/7,5,Oopsie McMuffin. I stuck to the recipe as is. It turned out great. Great way to replace bread. Made some more this morning.
2001232275,497736,2016/11/4,0,"I have made these a few times and just a quick tip here... it is SOOOOO important that you bake these on parchment paper!!! Not just a nonstick pan, not on a greased pan... on parchment! It also might work on a silpat but I haven't tried yet. I tried a couple times on a greased nonstick pan and it got so stuck it took ages to clean the pan and I obviously didn't get to eat any oopsie bread lol. Psyllium husk can be found at a lot of grocery stores, health food stores and Bulk Barn (for us Cannucks) sells it in bulk. I really think the psyllium helps the texture but I made these so many times before I knew about psyllium and they were still really good. As for texture you are basically making a heavier meringue so that's what you should expect. It is light and airy. Anyways, I hope this comment saves someones cookie sheet! lol"
2001224161,497736,2016/11/10,5,They came out perfectly! The underside is a medium brown. I followed the recipe exactly. Only used baking powder and I baked them on parchment paper. So light and fluffy!
2001293919,497736,2016/12/12,5,My first attempt at making these and they came out perfect. The eggs were straight out of the fridge. I used a hand mixer and cooked them on parchment paper. I love them! Thank you for this recipe :D
2001367038,497736,2017/1/26,0,Here's mine I added a teaspoon of white wine vinegar to egg whites before whisking.
2001432548,497736,2017/3/13,0,not so good
2001454507,497736,2017/3/25,0,I tryed the oopse bread first time and it looks nice
159552,497736,2017/4/19,4,I am extremely happy with this recipe! I have been Keto for a while and I miss bread. I had a fried egg sandwich with these today and I was quite happy! I even toasted a piece later with bread. Much better than cloud bread!
2001515860,497736,2017/5/1,5,"Two sisters trying this recipe without the psyllium husk. Look at how pretty they came out! Had egg, bacon and cheese sandwiches. They were a hit! The oppose bread held up great!"
2001576316,497736,2017/6/10,0,I cannot wait to try these!!
2001623088,497736,2017/7/12,5,"These are great! I recently decided to reduce my carb input, but needed to find a bread substitute for my daily sandwich. For me, this bread actually makes the sandwich better! There is only a mild taste of egg, but I think that just adds flavor to the sandwich. I followed the recipe exactly. A couple of recommendations: use an electric mixer with the wisk attachment for the egg whites and use parchment paper when baking. I did use baking powder and think it might add just a little thickness to them. The parchment paper not only makes them easy to remove, but seems to remove a little of the moisture. I keep the bread in the fridge inside a ziplock bag. I cut up the parchment paper into squares and place them inbetween the bread to make sure they don't stick."
2001639578,497736,2017/7/23,5,"Since I dislike cream cheese, I used cottage cheese and they still turned out great. I also used chia seeds instead of psyllium. In addition to the parchment paper, I suggest reversing the whipping of the whites and mixing the other ingredients. I'll get faster at mixing (there were... issues this first time that I won't have in the future) but still, leaving whipped whites to sit is a bad idea, they start breaking down immediately. I had to redo them using new eggs -- fresh out of the fridge, but that was fine. The hand mixer worked great (blender did not)."
2001666503,497736,2017/8/10,1,Not good. Tastes like egg whites not bread. I feel I followed the recipe but this seems nothing like bread
2001827771,497736,2017/11/27,0,Can you use Hemp hearts instead of psyllium husks?
2002135529,497736,2018/4/29,0,I have tried making this twice.... once I pour the egg yolks in the white peaks collapse and I have liquid. Room temperature whites. I live at 5000 feet could that be the problem. Apparently; the person before tried this 3x’s and has the same problem?
2002209359,497736,2018/7/5,5,So delightful! I might try the husks next time and maybe some seasoning/herbs. Any suggestions?
2002236477,497736,2018/8/1,5,These came out amazing! Thank you for the recipe. This is a 'game changer' for my newly adopted keto lifestyle.
2002275066,497736,2018/9/15,2,My husband and I tried this recipe 3 times and it came out as less then a crepe. Very frustrating! Followed the recipe to a &quot;T&quot;. Good luck
2002278789,497736,2018/9/19,3,It is essentially a lot like an omelette so as an alternative to bread it isn't bad but it definitely isn't bread-like
542159,505140,2016/8/16,5,Delicious way to show case the summer harvest of tomatoes and basil. I used the chive and onion flavored cream cheese as suggested and the works bagels making DH and I very happy campers this morning. Thanks for the post.
1925885,505140,2016/8/17,5,"Delicious, as I knew it would be! This was such a fresh breakfast! I used the brown Kumoto tomatoes, because that's what I had on hand. So not as pretty as a bright red slice. But the flavor was great! Thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest 2016."
128473,505140,2016/8/22,5,"What a great breakfast alternative, it's healthy, filling and very tasty. Light and very flavorful. I knew that I would enjoy this tasty treat. Served on a toasted sesame bagel. Thank you for sharing. Made for CQ3 - New York"
280271,512338,2017/1/16,4,I had some leftover spam...so made this yummy dish for my hubby...I sub carrots for the peppers only because I didn't have peppers...and instead of using water I used the juice from the canned pineapple...he really enjoyed it...made for your football win...
672534,512338,2018/3/26,3,"While this recipe concept is good, the sauce left something to be desired. I did make a couple substitutions: seasoned rice vinegar instead of regular vinegar and xylitol instead of Splenda (heat destroys the sweetness of Splenda) and 2 stalks celery for color, as I used red, yellow, and orange bell peppers. The powdered ginger and garlic left the taste somewhat flat and less fresh than it could have been. If I make this again, I'll be trying to find a better sauce from some other recipe. In order to save it, I added 1 Tbsp. more soy sauce, 1 tsp. fish sauce, and 1 Tbsp. Sriracha. The Sriracha really made a big difference without making it hot."
844554,512943,2014/4/18,5,I used this great herb mix on a boneless chicken breast and inhaled it! Very good. Unfortunately here in Hawaii I couldn&#039;t find savory or mace but I&#039;m sure it would have added to the taste. Made for PAC Spring 2014.
2001600069,499391,2017/6/25,4,"Made these today and came out Amazing. Would have given 5 Stars, but the Hormel canned Corned beef was an issue. I will make these again with thinly shaved Corned Beef from the Deli and I know they will be even better. Great recipe."
400708,496907,2013/3/18,4,"Simple, easy and fresh tasting.  Not overly sweet but liked the tang of the strawberries.  I used strawberries as that&#039;s what we had in season here in Trini and it&#039;s also one of my favorite berries.  But I can see this working with any thing, even other fruits like peaches or apples.  The hunks of berries in the mix after blending the first batch gave it a fresh taste.  I think it might even be good with shopped pecans or walnuts added to it.  I topped with sliced fresh berries and whipped cream.  Made for Spring PAC 2013"
2597942,504110,2014/4/25,4,"I&#039;m basing this review on hubby&#039;s rating only, as I didn&#039;t exactly care for any sweetened flavor (kettle corn) popcorn before even beginning this recipe, but hubby wanted me to make this after I read him the recipe. It was quite tasty, even for me. The salt and chipotle somewhat balances out the sweetness. Hubby thought it was just a bit off, but he asked me to try it again and adjust the amounts of seasonings. I&#039;ll give it another go in the future, as we have popcorn while watching a good movie. P.S. I made the stove top version of this in a dutch oven, although we actually do own a &quot;whirly pop&quot; (but it&#039;s somewhat of an antique and only for decor). Thanks for posting.

381180,515572,2014/5/26,5,"LOVE!!  A tender, moist yellow cake with just the right amount of lemon!  Unfortunately I didn&#039;t have a 9-inch round cake pan deep enough to hold all the batter, so I baked in a 8&quot;x8&quot;x2&quot; Pyrex dish for 30 minutes at 325F.  My lemons were large, so I also garnished with zest.  Tagged for Spring Photo Tag, due 05/25 (with extension)."
128473,515572,2014/10/20,5,"Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe breezer, we really enjoyed it.  It was quick and easy to make with terrific results.  The cake was tender and full of lemon flavor.  The glaze really enhances the flavor of the cake while the frosting is to die for.    Made as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing."
296809,515572,2014/11/25,5,"Made for your Football Pool win &amp; served as part of our multi-family Thanksgiving menu as it met the need for a lactose-free dessert. I made 2 chgs - 1 of necessity &amp; another as a pers preference. Pan sizes in Iceland are not consistent w/the US, so I used a 9-in sq baking pan &amp; cut the cake in 16 sq pieces to serve. Frosting is often viewed as overkill, esp if 2 desserts are eaten after a heavy meal. So I creatively turned the glaze &amp; frosting into a combo of the 2. This is an easy-fix &amp; was well-rec&#039;d. The crumb is tender, moist &amp; full of the lemon flavor. This was a real DH-pleaser dessert &amp; will definitely encore by request for spec occasions. Thx for sharing your recipe w/us."
160977,515572,2015/2/8,5,Wonderful cake. Omitted the frosting (we do not like frosting) but for the rest made as stated. Extremely pleased I found this recipe. Thanks for posting.
461834,515572,2015/2/10,5,"I just love lemon, so I knew I had to try this cake!!!  I loved the mixture of sour/tart with the sweet, but others felt it was too tart, what is wrong with them, lol!!!  I loved that this is a smaller cake, so not a huge amount of leftover cake, perfect now, for us empty nesters, lol!!!  Made for &quot;The Best of 2014&quot; tag game!!"
118840,492719,2013/4/7,5,"SO good, and nowhere near as hard as you&#039;d think.  Made exactly as written - we&#039;ll be doing this again for sure  :)"
133174,499552,2013/12/11,5,So yummy!  I made this using a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  The anchovy paste was left out as I seemed to be out.  The ingredients were placed into the Vita-Mix container and whirled until smooth.  This was served with some sauteed chicken sausage over gluten free penne pasta and I have enough sauce to either freeze or have again.  Something I will make again.  Made for Aussie Swap.
329769,495344,2013/3/1,5,"I was a bit hesitant about this recipe, but shouldn't have been. Easy to put together and really did make a nice tasty crust for my baked salmon.  I couldn't taste the cocoa or ketchup in this curst- the ingredients all blended together well.Good luck in the competition."
37449,495344,2013/3/1,4,I used this with salmon and it turned out nice! I halved the recipe. Good luck in the contest!
58104,495344,2013/3/3,3,"Sorry we weren't impressed with this recipe. Cocoa rubs we do enjoy especially with a chili powder added for a kick. Plus the addition of honey or sugar and oil would add sweetness and help caramelize. I never dry my basil so I used frozen basil form my last harvest. Garlic, black pepper and salt would have been nice too. Maybe if it had bread crumbs to cut the strong flavors. DH had to remove the crust so he can eat the salmon. This recipe makes a lot for a couple fillets it should state exact amount for the fillets because the leftover doesn`t store and a lot was wasted. Thanks"
239758,500060,2013/6/5,5,"Wow, what a great recipe. I made as written, except that I took it out of the oven after 30 minutes. I feared that the leeks and mushrooms would completely melt down. The flavours are absolutely divine. Served with Recipe #362056 and Recipe #499776. What a great dinner we all had."
37449,500060,2013/6/7,5,I scaled the recipe way down and enjoyed for lunch. I used ketchup in place of the tomato sauce. Thanks!
323186,507133,2015/2/2,5,"Unable to find a tomatillo-chile salsa here, I eventually found a green jalapeno salsa -- this worked wonderfully for us and the meal was a breeze to put-together,    this is a real keeper (esp since I still have a jar of salsa ;)  ) but even so, we loved this : I served it over rice but it could be enjoyed in so many ways!!!   Thank you for sharing, Nancy, a great success!!!"

227652,527902,2016/10/31,5,"My husband is on a very strict low carb diet &amp; he misses soups. This recipe hit the spot for him! I cut the recipe in half, used my own taco seasoning for the spices, had to leave out the onion AND cream cheese due to his diet restrictions--and used low sodium chicken broth. I let it simmer for a good 10-15 minutes. he really enjoyed it; thanks so much!"
2002098014,517630,2018/4/5,5,Very good! I added diced potatoes and broccoli to this recipe! Yum! Thanks!
780172,504182,2013/7/31,4,"This was quite good, however I did add more brown sugar than called for. I used cilantro from my garden, I used less than called for and felt it still was a little overpowering. Also, there was a lot of the sauce, probably could cut in 1/2. But with adjustments this is an interesting salad."
1925885,532429,2017/7/24,5,"Wow - good and spicy!!! Such an easy dish, but the flavors in the berbere are simply amazing and make this simple dish something gourmet! DH loved the heat index of the spices, but it was too much for me and I had to eat the squash with bites of other food (lentils). Next time, I'll use less of the berbere! Made for CQ4 play, Team Happy Campers. Thanks for posting!!!"
204024,532429,2017/8/7,5,This was a great savory dish to combine with our spicy chicken and chutney.
246482,535557,2018/7/2,5,"This was very tasty and I had to use a breast cause I defrosted them I really found it easy to make and hubby liked it. I just used table cram instead of full cream, parmesan cheese. Made for world tour 2018 and ate before remembering the photo"
323186,535557,2018/7/13,5,"Excellent and easily prepared and so very tasty, much enjoyed for Susies World Tour, Malta, Fellowship Of The Stove"
461834,535557,2018/7/13,5,"OMG!! This is fantastic!!! We made this as our main entree for the Malta region of Susie's World Tour. The only change made, was to use boneless/skinless chicken breast. This will be in our monthly rotation for dinners. Served it with baked lemon pasta and green beans with a twist for one scrumptious meal!! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe."
531029,535557,2018/7/15,5,Great recipe! A dish for Malta region on our tour. I am always cautious of recipes with fruit but this had just the right amont of lemon. Definitely a keeper.
2000018732,510632,2015/2/23,5,"This chili turned out pretty good.  I am not familiar with cooking with venison or the taste so I was rather nervous and used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground venison.
The flavor turned out really good.  I had no green pepper, used cayanne, and had a peach mango salsa instead of verde.  It had a great rich flavor.
I cooked elbow macaroni and then gave the option of having it mixed in the bowl, under the chili or without.  Would recommend!"
2000034423,518859,2016/9/27,5,"Adding pur&eacute;e to a gf recipe can be a dicey proposition. The quantities in this recipe are spot on. I used Pillsbury gf flour mix, with no substitutions and it worked perfectly. Even my non-gf eating family members raved!"
136997,508930,2014/1/23,5,"Thumbs up from the husband. Delish. I omitted the onion (personal preference) and added the shrimp in raw, since extra cooking time can make them rather rubbery. Worked out fine. I did however saute the mushrooms in the butter and garlic. :)"
227978,505020,2014/4/23,4,"This had plenty of delicious chocolate flavor!  And it was enough that I split it in half and my husband and I enjoyed our mini chocolate cakes with our morning coffee.  What a treat.  The reason for giving it only 4 stars is that it was a little too dry for our taste buds.  I didn&#039;t want to open a can of frosting just to frost two single-serving mug cakes, so I just sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  But it needs frosting or whipped cream on top, to add a little moisture.  This definitely would satisfy any sweet tooth or to cure chocolate cravings.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, ninyai.  Made for the Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef event."
2000607471,505020,2015/10/26,1,"I don&#039;t know how this could have ended so badly but it did. I made it exactly how the recipe said and was left with a sloppy, barely cooked pile. Microwave is new too :( Hopefully this recipe works for someone else."
2000924091,505020,2016/3/17,4,"At 3 minutes mine burned, but two and a half done perfectly!! Lovely recipe!"
2001992958,505020,2018/2/15,5,I made mine with 2minutes and 30 seconds in the microwave. Also I put 4 heaped tablespoons of Milo as I love it. The cake was delicious and moist
2002102161,505020,2018/4/8,5,"I did it at 2mins and 30seconds and it was perfect! I actually added few more spoons of Milo and instead of 1 whole egg I added 2 egg yolks. It was so moist. ?? Will do this again, but I'll try through oven next time. Great recipe!"
239758,513131,2014/3/29,5,"Great recipe for lamb shanks and so very easy to make. I followed the recipe except for the tomato paste and the bouquet garni. Usually I never run out of things, but I couldn&#039;t find even a speck of tomato paste in the cupboard, so in desperation I used a sachet of fajita sauce. As for the bouquet garni, I have a jar of herbes de provence, so used a heaped teaspoon of that instead. My shanks weren&#039;t frenched, so I expected, and got, quite a bit of fat, which I spooned off while the sauce was cooking down. I completely forgot the sugar and it was not missed. Served and enjoyed with snow peas and mashed potatoes -- got to have something to soak up all that wonderful sauce. Thanks to you Pat and to Julie Goodwin too."
2668320,494030,2013/1/31,5,What a great idea and recipe! I love Pierogi's. Can't wait to try this.

2000809488,527072,2017/7/17,5,"Made it this evening, it turned out great. I'm not sure what exactly cream cheese is in USA, but here I used fromage frais (3.3% fat) and the cake is light and fluffy. It's not very sweet though. Some will want to have it with jam. Thanks for posting"

2001529464,526749,2018/4/9,1,This recipe should be removed. She is only trying to promote her own sauce as previous reviewers stated. Very shady way to conduct business. She must be very desperate for sales and have horrible tasting sauce!
2714781,494315,2013/2/27,5,I made this recently and was very happy.  It is VERY close to the canned version.  I used white beans I bought at Costco and they turned very dark but were very tasty.  I live on the west coast now and cant get grandma browns baked beans here.  (I dont want to pay alot for shipping)  This recipe will curb my cravings from back east.  Thank you!!
1052873,495347,2013/4/21,5,"I only made the chicken part, but it was really awesome! Next time I&#039;ll plan ahead better and make at least the slaw too."
1872490,494315,2014/10/5,5,"Being an  Upstate New Yorker, the canned Grandma Brown&#039;s Beans are always a staple in our family. I came across this recipe and made them immediately. They were so good. I couldn&#039;t taste the difference. They are absolutely delicious! I still keep cans on the shelf, but will definitely Make them again.&lt;br/&gt;Tank you KS100 for the recipe."
2001073853,494315,2016/7/3,5,Was just as I remember it tasting. My sister sent me a pound of Zweigle's hots and I tried this recipe for a real blast from the past meal. They were mild and the texture was just perfect. I will definitely make them again.
2000606085,494315,2017/1/23,5,This recipe came out amazing. I was so pleased after trying over and over to make baked beans with a thicker and softer consistency. I let them cool and refrigerated for a day while searching out my mother's old recipe that started with the canned version. Of course I had to taste them and they have a lovely subtle flavor even without dressing them up. Thanks so much for the recipe.
2002119018,494315,2018/4/17,5,My wife is from Upstate New York and loved these beans. She likes them sweet so I added a bit of Brer Rabbit dark molasses and a bit of dark real maple syrup. This recipe never disappoints!
2324285,502987,2013/7/28,5,"I love the flavors in this salad, and it was nice how quick and easy it was to make.  The nectarines were my favorite part- I love them, but have never had them in a salad.  I added a chopped serrano salad to the mixture, so my salad was very spicy as well as sweet.

169430,510124,2014/3/17,5,I do love compound butters. Yesterday I made a big batch of bran muffins and Sweet Ginger Butter from this recipe. What a marvelous combo they made. So much so that it was really hard to stop at 2 muffins! Looking forward to trying the berry butter also. :D
128473,510124,2016/1/3,5,"I made the sweet ginger version.  It was awesome, quick, easy and delicious.  I will be making this again and again, kept looking for it after it was all gone.  I served it with hot buttermilk biscuits. Yum, I can still taste it. Thanks for sharing Deb."
169430,493140,2013/1/16,5,"This is a real treat and an excellent morning coffee. I didn't use any milk, I rarely use it anyway but in this case I didn't want it to interfere with the orange water. It's smooth and the warm spice combined with the orange is pure pleasure. Something this nice with only 4.6 calories? Bonus! :D"

128473,493140,2013/11/20,5,What a lovely mug of coffee.  I loved the addition of the orange blossom to the drink.  It is very subtle in the coffee.  The spices were wonderful.  Thank you for sharing this new favorite coffee.
276833,518639,2016/3/22,1,"This was great.  I&#039;m full up paleo, so this was perfect,  My wife is not paleo, but she loved it too.  I substituted 2 tbl of honey for the sweetener, and added 2 tbl cocoa powder, substituted cran-raisins for the blue berries, and topped with chopped walnuts.   This will be my go-to treat to have with coffee on weekend mornings.  Caution:  Use a very tall mug and make sure the sides are coated with the butter or oil."
2597942,505100,2014/4/16,5,"Well, I must say, this was a nice change for me. I made 3 for lunch today for hubby &amp; I. I&#039;ve been making Cheese Crisps for 30 years and never once thought about &quot;baking&quot; them. I&#039;ve always made them in a skillet on the stove-top. I&#039;ve always used the same ingredients that Lynn does (I put the jalepeno&#039;s &quot;under&quot; the cheese) and always serve them with Pace Picante Sauce drizzled over the top. YUMMY! I used my own Recipe #513631 to make these. I liked this &quot;baked&quot; method because I can make more than one at a time (as I do with the skillet method). If only making one for myself, I will probably still use the skillet rather than heating up the oven, but this is a great way to make 3 at a time. Thanks for posting. (Made for PAC 2014)"

1706426,506139,2013/10/31,4,"I gave it four stars only because I found it to be too salty with both cheese and salt. Otherwise it would be great way to prepare asparagus! Thanks for sharing, made for your football win 2013"

169430,493504,2013/5/10,5,"Photo&#039;s may be seen here in the Savor gallery: www.annacia.com. I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. This has to be one of the very best hot chocolates I have made. The almond milk (which I most always have on hand) gives it a perfect body and consistency. I know that it&#039;s an oft used word but I can&#039;t think of a better one to describe the texture, it&#039;s pure silk.  The taste is heavenly, the bittersweet is not wasted in this elegant cup of goodness. The single drawback (for me) is that it makes small cups.  I used a smallish tea cup and it took most of the batch, when I have drunk some out I added the rest and I believe that it was less than 1/4 of a cup that I added. Don&#039;t be shy, double this recipe if you want two mug&#039;s. I promise, you won&#039;t be sorry. :D"
1256549,495826,2013/2/22,5,"Wow.  I made this exactly as directed, and it turned out amazing.  (Well, I used gluten-free spaghetti instead of tortellini because I don't think they make gluten-free tortellini yet.)  I was hesitant when I saw 2 CUPS of red wine because I usually don't use that much to deglaze, but it wasn't too much at all.  It added the perfect amount of depth and complexity to the sauce and really harmonized with the beef and sausage.  This was really easy to make too.  Definitely a keeper."
498271,505083,2014/2/21,5,Terrific coffee!  We almost always brew our coffee with cinnamon but the addition of the cardamom and the sweetening from the honey really gave this an exotic flavor.  Loved this coffee - thanks for sharing the recipe!

I normally like my coffee black and unsweetened, but I thoroughly enjoyed the spices and honey in this.  I used a dark French roast and it worked perfectly.

183964,510061,2016/8/19,0,I substituted liver for turkey and wine for vodka. I don't think these minor adjustments affected the flavor of the original recipe. I would not serve to company. 1 star.
2001856928,536977,2018/11/26,5,I made this for Thanksgiving this year which was very appropriate since it was our first Thanksgiving living in Wisconsin. This was super tasty and a fun change from traditional stuffing. The only thing I might change is to reduce the chicken broth since it could have been a bit crispier. Yum!

I subbed close to 2 pounds of chicken thighs and breasts.The hazelnuts  (Oregon grown!) were dry roasted in a cast iron skillet.To avoid burning the honey (local honey!)/nut mixture I pounded out the chicken first then marinated. You&#039;ll need that green onion garnish because there is much flavor but very little color going on.

The flavor of the scallions and chilies went great with the shrimp - I was worried that they'd be too sweet or tough from the extra cooking but they were terrific. I always make my own pizza dough - just 3C flour, 2tsp salt, 2tsp yeast, and water in the food processor, super easy.

Also it's originally a Vietnamese dish, B&ograve; l&uacute;c l?c, so the Cambodian version is basically copy. Laos and Thailand have similar dishes called yam nua (thai) and yam sin ngua (lao). There are not rules, just marinate beef in salt, pepper and lime, grill and add to some greens."
2002347949,496461,2018/11/25,5,I did it and it was delicious - it even pleased a 14 year old Cambodian boy who is away from home. Added sauteed zucchini from the garden and fresh lettuce too. Just left out the cucumbers - can't stand them. Well done - it may not be like other recipes but it was fresh and tasty and the balance of oyster and fish sauce seemed great to me.

47559,518078,2014/9/7,4,I made these griddle cakes for the grandsons this morning.  They had a nice buttery flavor.  I served them with maple syrup.  We enjoyed them very much.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
305531,518078,2014/9/11,5,I really enjoyed these. Simple and good. I served them with recipe #517712 and they were great. Thanks for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
314579,518078,2014/9/11,5,"Yep, these are really tasty!  I made just a half batch for 2 of us, it was easy to convert.  Served with huckleberry compote and maple syrup.  Thanks for posting!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014 PNW region."
1179225,518078,2015/1/6,5,"Really nice! Buttery, but not heavy. The texture is different than a pancake, not as fluffy, but thicker than a crepe. Thanks for sharing the recipe, we really enjoyed these."
2690661,495199,2013/2/12,5,My husband said to keep this on the menu...finally a breakfast pizza that he likes.
2691366,495199,2013/2/12,5,The whole family loves this - even the picky eaters.  Will definitely make this again soon!
2692089,495199,2013/2/13,5,Yummy!  Can't wait to make it again :)
2691349,495199,2013/2/14,5,A VERY good pizza.  GREAT!!!  The honey in the dough is a nice touch.  Love the half & half in the eggs.  No ingredient goes un-savored.  And it doesn't take that long to make if you discount dough rise time / processing.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
2694347,495199,2013/2/14,5,"Finally a breakfast pizza that don't taste like a salt lick!  It was so good and my kids loved it!  And I am sure it is much better for them,"
2700737,495199,2013/2/19,5,Good stuff. Will have to make this one again.
1800067480,504769,2013/9/19,2,Its  missing wine and panchetta. Thats the Italian way
2000107939,504769,2017/4/17,1,"Skip the onions and never, ever use ketchup in Italian recipes!"
2000931324,509221,2018/2/21,4,This has a delicious rich roasted flavor.
128473,501169,2013/6/22,5,"What a lovely cake this recipe makes, soft, tender and full of flavor. Loved the little pops of extra flavor in the cake from the crystallized ginger and the golden raisins. The lime and rum honey glaze is delicious, not overly sweet.  You mentioned sugar in the glaze istructions, but sugar is not listed in the ingredients, so I didn&#039;t use any and didn&#039;t miss it.  I used toasted coconut in your recipe, was what I had in the pantry.  I made two versions of this cake, one without rum, ginger and pecans for dh and the other version exactly as written for myself.  Both versions were very tasty, it was a great use of contest ingredients. The cake baked for   45 minutes. Good Luck in the contest."
2002058390,492723,2018/3/17,5,I made this as part of my new diet and was not expecting to like it. I am your typical meat and potato kind of guy who really doesn't like vegetables at all. I made this cause a lot of the reviews says that it gives energy since I gave up coffee as part of my diet too. It not only gives me the energy I need to get going in the morning but it tastes really good. Every time I have made it my 9 year old picky daughter and 2 year old &quot;sweets only&quot; daughter harass me to give them some so I am now having to double the recipe lol.
88099,511981,2014/1/25,3,"This is a difficult review for me as I&#039;m not a baker and not sure what I did wrong but:  as written this did not work for me.  I could not get the bar mixture to combine into a smooth mixture.  Not sure what to do, I added more vegetable oil and honey (double)  and it was still very thick.  I spread it into my pan and had to bake it about 40 minutes and it still didn&#039;t get completely done in the middle but it was getting very brown on the top and bottom and decided to take it out.  (I wish I had added egg instead of double the oil and honey but not sure that would have worked either)  The end result was a very sweet and chewy Honey bar that my DH is eating his 3rd portion of.  The glaze is fantastic and will be used on other treats.   If anyone can help me on this recipe I would love to hear from you, especially weekend cooker, as I would love to make these again without all the oil and honey.  Thanks for sharing."
2698687,497440,2013/3/14,5,"I noticed this recipe after printing out the chorizo smothered potatoes(You must try) and made I made this for dinner. I love simply potatoes, Italian sausage and gnocchi. What a quick fix. Hats off to the chef."
2690702,497440,2013/3/14,0,Sounds good!! I love Gnocchi. I&#039;m going to have to bring out my inner chef to try and roll it myself. Wish me luck!  ;-)
2702373,497440,2013/3/15,5,"Excellent dish! Easy to make, and tastes like a real chef made it haha. Nice work!"
2703631,497440,2013/3/15,5,It is a great dish. Easy recipe!!!
2748972,497440,2013/3/22,5,Excellent flavors! I love the way they are incorporated together! This was just a perfect master piece!
2582899,495751,2016/8/13,5,The sauce is absolutely delicious. Marcello Tully is a wonderful chef. But what has it got to do with cheesecake??
2706705,497440,2013/3/23,5,This looked so good I had to try it. I love pasta and this was a unique way to make pasta and use potatoes. I sometimes have left over potatoes or mashed potatoes from dinner so I think it would be easy to substitute. Great dish Chef JaylinHawkins
2749571,497440,2013/3/23,5,"quick, easy and delicious. For those who don&#039;t like to cook, you can save this and freeze it for a different day. Umm good!"
2749663,497440,2013/3/23,5,Gnocchi has always been a challenge for me. But this recipe made it doable! Maybe I&#039;ll sub the sausage with spicy italian next time...hmmmmm
2739309,497440,2013/3/23,5,Sounds delicious!
2750471,497440,2013/3/23,5,Tried this recipe it was quick and delisous. I love susage and potatoes togather.Have never had Gnocchi before it was good!!!!
47892,501927,2013/6/28,5,"I made this in a different matter. Here&#039;s what I did: first I washed basmati rice in a fine sieve ntil the water ran clear. Placed the rice in a large pot of water, salted and brought to the boil. Boiled rice about 8 minutes. Drained. Placed 1 tablespoon of butter in the pan, spooned half the rice in the pan, smoothed the top, dotted with most of the Turkish apricots which were cut up into small pieces, another 1 tablespoon of butter then spooned remaining rice on top, smoothing the surface. Placed a tea towel folded up on top, covered and simmered on low for 30 minutes using the smallest burner on the stove top. After rice has cooked the rice was loosened on the edges using a flat rubber spatula, pan inverted onto a serving plate. Garnished top with almonds, pistachios and the rest of the Turkish apricots. Delicious! Made for NA*ME Tag game/Summer."
2622313,493209,2013/1/8,5,"Wow, fantastic. Made tonight for friends and they could not stop raving. Very good!!"
136597,493209,2013/1/22,0,"Because I was making this the same day as visiting the grocery store and they didn't have any ripe avocados, I left them out.  Because of personal preference I left out the bell pepper and jalapeno.  I followed the recipe otherwise, and absolutely loved it!!  Next time I will plan ahead and make sure to add the avocados!"
1133653,498307,2013/6/2,0,"Love this recipe, even though I used broccoli instead since we had no spinach at the time.  I just precooked it a little in the microwave first, then sauteed with onions, butter, tarragon, and turmeric.  (I love the Persian ones, and turmeric is so darned good for all.)  My husband gave it 5/5 stars!  Thanks for helping learn about fritatas! (I posted my own photo of the broccoli version.)"
400708,498307,2014/4/15,4,"Made for breakfast today and DH loved it for flavor, I loved it for ease in making, the flavor was good to me but next time I might use Swiss cheese just as a personal preference as feta has always had a strong taste to me.  Didn&#039;t use the tarragon as didn&#039;t have any but did sprinkle with Paprika for color before putting in the oven  felt the flavors were good.  Made for PRMR and was a good chose."
842751,520248,2014/12/30,5,"This is really good and so easy., I made it for lunch when my sister was here because her husband hates tuna and she never gets to eat  it at home. I left out the tabasco sauce because we don&#039;t care for it and I added sliced green onions instead. This is so good. I also used the white chunk Albacore tuna in water well drained. YUM. Thanks for sharing this one."
1179225,520248,2015/1/9,4,"Nice quick meal. I halved the mayo and also it was still a little too rich for us, but that&#039;s just a personal preference Thanks for sharing this quick and tasty recipe."
48150,496038,2017/3/12,5,"This was delicious and easy. The only change I made (which made it even easier) was to use marinated artichoke hearts. That eliminated all the artichoke prep, and gave the chicken and potatoes a wonderful taste, probably about the same as the result of using the frozen artichokes and dressing them per the recipe. We loved it and I'll definitely be making it again -- maybe with chicken drumsticks next time. Yum!"
1800034676,503546,2013/8/27,4,Delicious but very salty -- good with cold beer!
95700,503546,2014/5/8,4,very good!
28636,509438,2016/12/27,5,"New favorite dressing at our house! Have used it on a salad of mixed greens and orange sections, and also drizzled it on the greens before rolling up a wrap of salmon, cucumber and greens. A versatile dressing - thanks PaulaG!"
107583,494823,2014/4/24,4,"The meatballs are easy to make and taste fine, but the dish turned out a little dry.  I will add more sauce next time.  We can&#039;t get passata here so I subbed equal amount of homemade spaghetti sauce.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
1072593,494225,2013/4/2,5,So delectable this left me speechless.  Now that&#039;s a provoking thought. *PAC Spring 2013*
2000311799,494225,2015/7/3,5,"I made this tonight for my husband&#039;s family (10 people) and it was a HUGE hit!  The blackening seasoning was excellent.  My brother-in-laws were stealing pieces of the chicken before I even assembled the sandwiches.
I used whole wheat sandwich bread and pre-toasted it in the toaster on the lowest setting to get it &quot;crusty.&quot;  Then I layered shredded mozzarella cheese, chicken, red pepper, tomato, bacon and spicy ranch.  I didn&#039;t have a panini maker, so I used a George Foreman grill.  YUM!!!"
2001311460,521481,2016/12/21,5,I made this dish according to the directions and it was wonderful!... The next time I make it I'm going to add 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to up the heat but other than that the recipe is awesome! I also used Jumbo Shrimp and half a pound of regular spaghetti noodles. It still turned out delicious!...
2001916427,521481,2018/1/6,1,Did not like it at all!
1157853,496992,2014/9/5,5,"These were really good, i was looking for a brownie recipe that didn&#039;t call for butter since i was out. This was even better since i can mix the dry ingredients and store it for later. Thanks for posting!"
2000225109,496992,2015/5/25,5,My niece is allergic to dairy and most recipes call for butter or margarine so she has to go without. So reading through and googling for new recipes I came across this one and made a batch for my family. Needless to say the pan was gone in less than 24 hours. My 18 year old son was craving brownies and since this recipe is so easy I had him help me with a batch. This recipe is simply the best and tastes amazing.
2000242592,496992,2015/6/2,5,Delicous and easy! My son loves them and we do too. I added chocolate chips
2000277426,496992,2015/6/18,5,This is my new all time favorite brownie recipe!!
2000284478,496992,2015/6/21,0,My kids say it&#039;s a keeper recipe i know i&#039;ll be making another double batch in a day or two
2000285933,496992,2015/6/21,5,Very Good &amp; Useful
2000293674,496992,2015/6/25,5,This is the best recipe I&#039;ve found so far.  It&#039;s simple and easy and so so so delicious.
2000338799,496992,2015/7/14,5,"These brownies are so easy, fast, simple, and delicious. My mom said they are even better than the Pampered Chef brownie recipe."
2000406488,496992,2015/8/16,0,I haven&#039;t made them yet but they look awesome
2000417110,496992,2015/8/20,0,"I made this recipe and followed the directions exactly. Very good! Just your basic brownie, no frills. I will def make again. I didn&#039;t have a 9x9 pan but used something similar in size. Only took 20 min in my oven"
2000481538,496992,2015/9/20,5,"Love that you can mix the dry ingredients and keep it for later...also noticed that the recipe is perfect for kids because you only use one measuring cup per ingredient since they are all different amounts (except for the teaspoon used for salt and baking powder). I used a larger pan because we like ours chewy (like the edges of a thicker brownie). So we end up with thin brownies, but it&#039;s like baking a sheet of just the edges....thanks for the recipe"
2000550546,496992,2015/10/11,5,Just made them! Let them cool for about half hour. They was so easy to make and tasted great!
1460111,496992,2016/4/12,5,"I&#039;ve made these twice, once with the dry mix I had bagged separately while making the first batch.  I wrote the wet ingredients needed on the bag, along with the oven temp and baking time.  They are very chocolatey and delicious!  I added nuts and substituted a couple of TB of butter for some of the oil.  I think I&#039;ll cut the oil back a little next time, and replace it with a scoop of yogurt - they seem a little too &quot;oily&quot; for me.  However, the flavor is great.  Add a dash of cold brewed coffee if you have any leftover- it really boosts the chocolate flavor.   Mine bake just right in 18 minutes.  I used a 9&quot; round pan.   I won&#039;t buy commercial mixes again, now that I can make moist, wonderful brownies without the artificial ingredients in the mixes.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
2001020938,496992,2016/5/22,5,"So easy and delicious! I only had 1/2 tsp. Of vanilla extract left and was worried it wouldn't be sweet enough, so I topped it with crushed butterfinger and it was amazing! Also, I used an 8x8 glass dish and baked for about 30 mins. New favorite recipe!"
2001004516,496992,2016/7/22,5,"Wonderful recipe, but I did make a few changes/additions. I did double the recipe and subbed in 3/4 C applesauce with only 1/4 C oil to slightly lessen a bit of the caloric impact (or you can lessen the sugar instead of the oil too-applesauce is great for lessening either!). They came out incredibly moist, but you'll have to probably up the cooking time some. Toothpicks came out semi-wet, so I watched until the brownies pulled away from the sides a little and the top was firm and not sticky to a quick tap of the fingers. I also gilded the lily with maybe 2 T-spoons of mild dried ancho chilies reconstituted in hot water (discard the seeds when breaking them up) and finely mined into oblivion. Anchos seriously punch up the chocolate flavor to 11 without making them spicy. No seriously, they weren't spicy. Oh, and I threw in a little chopped up dark chocolate just to be ridiculous. I was not playing around here and they turned out killer!"
2001098490,496992,2016/7/22,5,This tastes exactly the betty crocker one. My family loved the brownies.
2001163951,496992,2016/9/11,5,"Made first batch by the instructions, gooey goodness! 2nd batch added my own twists and I'm in LOVE! In the time it took to preheat the oven, the batter was ready to go. My version: I added a splash of coffee, a dash of smoked paprika, walnuts, doubled the salt, and only used one egg (I like them dense and fudgy), and only baked them for 18 mins in a pie tin. Crisp edges, ooey gooey middles."
2001547366,496992,2018/1/25,5,I made theses with a twist and omg they were a hite with my family
2001968091,496992,2018/2/2,5,These brownies are the holy grail of brownies. Only problem I had was the size of the batch so I just doubled it. They taste identical to the Betty Crocker mix you buy at the store but 100x better.
384210,496992,2017/3/4,5,"Turned out pretty close to boxed brownie texture. Not sure about how close the taste gets to boxed because we added a dried ghost pepper (chopped super fine, almost to powder). Will add a tsp of cinnamon to complement the ghost pepper in the future."
2001477462,496992,2017/4/8,5,Thin fudgy brownies with a crunchy crust. Delicious
2001499809,496992,2017/4/21,5,"I literally just made an account to review this recipe. It is so simple but better than any boxed brownies I have ever had. I let them cool, then made a chocolate buttercream and chulled them until the frosting hardened but the center was still hot. The most amazing brownies ice ever had. Made them 2 nights in a row!"
2001512075,496992,2017/4/29,5,I use only a 1/3 cup of oil and bake for 22 minutes at 350. I also exclude the baking powder which makes it less cake like.
2001532896,496992,2017/5/12,5,These are so good! I will never buy a box brownie mix again. These are Amazing!!!! I added chopped pecans the second time and just made another batch with peanut butter drizzle.
2001604360,496992,2017/6/29,5,"This is the only brownie recipe I'll use from now on! It turns out great every time and tastes wonderful! In my latest batch I even added a cup of peanut butter chips, YUM!"
2001622578,496992,2017/7/11,5,These brownies came out perfect! I usually use a box mix but did not have one. I found this recipe and had all of the ingredients on hand. I doubled the recipe and added some Walnut pieces and baked for 25 minutes in an 11x15 pan. They were to be for tonight after dinner with chocolate sauce and reddi whip but they looked so good I'm eating a warm one now. This will be my new go-to brownie recipe
2000299349,496992,2017/7/18,5,#NAME?
2001572432,496992,2017/7/22,0,Great brownies! Add a teaspoon of Kahlua to really bring out the flavor.
2001690627,496992,2017/8/28,5,These brownies are delicious! They are so easy to make. My only regret is not eating them when they were still warm from the oven! I will definitely be making these again in the future.
2001794316,496992,2017/11/13,0,"I added chocolate chips and it was great,has anyone tryed adding coconut and chocolate chips?This might be a good idea. ??"
2001919085,496992,2018/1/8,5,"I followed the recipe, only added about a tbsp of Camerons Choice Chocolate Brownie coffee grounds. I must say, &quot;oy vey!!&quot; This recipe would please my bubbe for sure!!"
2001927760,496992,2018/1/12,0,Can someone help me tweak the recipe so it'll fit into a 9x13 pan
2002019863,496992,2018/2/27,1,This is the absolute worst brownie recipe I have ever made! Totally a failure!!! Can't rate it low enough
2002034317,496992,2018/3/6,0,Love these brownies. Don't like box mixes so this wonderful. My little 6 year old granddaughter loves them and would eat them all at one sitting. Thanks for recipe
2002073306,496992,2018/3/24,5,"Just made these brownies for the first time. I usually use boxed brownies, but didn’t have any today. So, I whipped these up with stuff I already had in the cabinet. So quick and easy. These are delicious, fudgy brownies! The whole family loved them :)"
2002080447,496992,2018/3/28,0,Just put in oven let's see if they are better than the box I'll be making them all the time.
2000217432,496992,2018/4/5,1,Nasty horrible recipe waste of ingredients. You are wasting your time with this
2002100302,496992,2018/4/7,5,This recipe was the most delicious turn out of homemade brownies I have ever made. I recommend for parties and all sort of occasions.
2002160991,496992,2018/5/22,5,"I found this by googling scratch brownies or similar. The ingredients were all on hand, they didn't seem like anything special, but I was craving brownies so I made them anyway. Thirty minutes, a bowl, a fork, then some really tasty brownies that were gooey but held together and had a really nice flavor from no box and so cheap! I'm an avid home cook, not a baker. I would almost guess this recipe is dude-proof if he knows the toothpick test for doneness. If I'd seen this recipe when I worked in an office, I'd have made them all the time for coworkers. just too easy not to."
2002180548,496992,2018/6/9,0,was my dough supposed to come out thick? I guess I'll find out when they get out of the oven.
2002191167,496992,2018/6/19,5,BEST BROWNIES EVER
2002265657,496992,2018/9/3,5,"Absolutely loved the recipe! It was a small amount though so I'll double it next time. To those that had such a bad experience, no need to be rude. Recipes are never a &quot;one size fits all&quot;. As you can see, others have tweaked or kept it the same if not doubled amount. So, if it didn't work then keep it as that."
2002286185,496992,2018/9/27,0,can I use the melt butter instead of the oil? or which one taste better?
2002311587,496992,2018/10/25,3,"It wasn't too bad for me, but it was springy, kinda that springy rubbery texture, and more cake like for me. Not at all fudgy... But maybe i overbaked it? or because I baked them in cupcake pan?"
2002326656,496992,2018/11/10,5,I added a chocolate icing for brownies. Doubled the recipe and came out perfect. Everyone at work wanted this recipe.
2002352139,496992,2018/11/30,1,Horrible!!!! Recipe calls to cook in a 9x9 pan but there was barely enough mix to cover a 8x8 pan they came out paper thin and tasted nasty. You would literally have to triple this recipe to make a halfway thick brownie in a 8x8 pan only problem with that is it would still not taste good. What a waste of ingredients.
496803,502959,2013/7/18,4,"This was a wonderful tasting dish, and a great way to get some vegetables into a BBQ feast!  I think the carrots were my favorite, beautiful orange and still crisp textured after cooking.  The beans I wasn&#039;t so thrilled with- they turned grey as they cooled and though they tasted great they were really unappealing to look at. The only other suggestion I&#039;d make is to maybe add a bit of chile flakes into the liquid for a bite of heat.  Made for ZWT9"
382203,502959,2013/9/16,3,"sorry we found this kind of boring, they needed flabvor"
2001956783,521481,2018/1/27,5,I followed the recipe but added green onions for garnish before serving...Next time I would add some mushrooms but the taste was excellent !!!
2001980308,521481,2018/2/8,1,"Too much mayo, the thai sauce did not give it much flavor either. Tossing the recipe"
266635,494135,2013/4/28,5,"Delicious slowcooker recipe and perfect for a nice hearty meal.  I have never made polenta before and this recipe turned out perfectly.  I used boneless short ribs in this dish and used the gorgonzola in the polenta and it works great.  DH loved it!  Next time I make the polenta, I might try the parmesan version since it is so easy to make.  Will definitely make this dish again! Made for PRMR, April, 2013."
2324285,504178,2013/7/28,4,"Very good and unique rice.  I don&#039;t like smoked things, so I used regular canned oysters.  It was still good.  I had this with Thai food, so I used fish sauce instead of soy sauce.  This rice isn&#039;t for everyone, but I liked the strong oyster and white pepper flavor."
2001207833,527864,2016/10/15,5,This is very authentic. Niche recipe. Tasted great
482376,502883,2013/7/22,4,"Very nice dressing recipe. The flavors all worked really well together. It turns out to be a chunkier dressing with the chopped ingredients, so it was like another topping on my salad! Thanks for posting. Made for ZWT9 and the Soup-A-Stars"
133174,504556,2013/9/14,4,Once everything is prepped this recipe goes together quick.  It was served over brown rice for an enjoyable lunch.  Made for Aussie Swap.
39835,504556,2014/4/17,5,Very enjoyable dinner - and I had the oyster sauce but not the asparagus - this was great using a leek (instead of onion) and red bell pepper instead of the asparagus. I used less shrimp to make it for two people. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!
233780,504556,2014/5/3,0,"A really nice meal, I did tweak it a bit as I only wanted to make it for two people, so I cut down the amount of shrimp and asparagus to half the amount, but left the other ingredients as per the recipe as I felt that cuttung the oyster sauce down would not give enough flavor - I just added 1 small birds eye dried chilli as it does boost the flavor - I would definately make it again, thanks for posting this"
2000431901,504556,2016/8/29,5,"SO delicious! I've made it as written, but also subbed hoisin sauce when out of oyster sauce and, although it changes the flavor, it's still wonderful."
1620171,502749,2013/8/4,5,"This was delicious, we left it to marinate overnight. Very easy lunch the next day. Made for ZWT 9 for the Tasty Testers."
2597942,522867,2015/8/24,5,"Made these tonight for dinner.  Quite tasty, and very easy to make (These are made using the same technique as my Rouladen). I used the Soy sauce/ mirin/ rice vinegar mixture on all of the scallion greens, but then brushed half of them with Soy Sauce, and Teriyaki sauce on the rest. Both were good. I used a thin cut round steak and pounded the heck out of it (just like I normally do). They took about 6 minutes to get done on the grill. I will try and get the pic posted. Made for CQ 2015 Family Picks for LBOB&#039;s"
1925885,522867,2015/8/27,5,Wonderful! These were so easy to put together and were so unusual!  I grilled them on a stovetop cast iron grill pan - just right!  Thank you for posting a keeper of a recipe! Made for Culinary Quest 2015 by a Toasted Tourist.
610488,503639,2013/8/22,5,Flavorful and filling!! Easy to make and lots left over for the next day!
329769,503639,2013/8/24,4,Reviewed for ZWT9- I cooked this dish using my new tagine- turned out lovely- moist and flavourful. A great Moroccan flavoured vege dish that was enjoyed .
119577,507924,2013/10/19,5,"These were delicious, even though I made a lot of changes.  Admittedly, I get irritated when I read reviews and the reviewer has changed everything about the recipe. However, I am trying to reduce my calorie and fat intake so I made some adjustments, so please forgive me :)  I used high fiber tortillas, and sprayed muffin tins with olive oil instead of buttering.  This made them a little difficult to remove, so next time I&#039;d probably use a bit of butter. I used 2% shredded cheese, and Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  Delicious, very filling and oh so attractive when they come out of the oven!  These are sure to impress your brunch guests!  If I made them without my adjustments, I&#039;m sure they would be five stars plus!"
37449,507924,2013/10/23,5,Made with whole wheat flaxseed tortillas and sprayed them with cooking spray instead of butter. Made 3(one with the scraps from the other 2 tortillas). This made a great dinner. Thanks!
107135,507924,2013/11/3,5,"this is very good .i cut tortillas in half and sprayed with pam before stuffing into the muffin tins  really good , didnt put cheese on so could see for picture"
400708,507924,2014/4/1,5,"Nancy this is good on so many levels.  Great flavors, easy and fast to make &amp; looks attractive when done; could anything be better!  My only changes were to cut WAY back there&#039;s only 2 of us; &amp; instead of muffin tins I put them in a ramekin.  Great flavors that I&#039;ll be using again and again.  Made for PRMR game"
157167,507924,2014/7/10,5,"These were great!  I didn&#039;t butter because I have a nonstick muffin pan, and the tortillas crisped up beautifully.  For my tastes I should have pulled it out 2-3 minutes sooner, because the eggs were fully set and I prefer a runny yolk.  Because I have a 12 muffin pan I did 6 with eggs, and 6 with just the bean and salsa mixture.  I cut 10&quot; tortillas into 1/3s and they worked perfectly.  Made for the &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; tag game @ http://4foodfriendsandfun.yuku.com/"
323186,507924,2014/10/9,5,"Im not sure if I should have used larger baking trays,  mine are actually cupcake tins rather than muffin tins, nonetheless, this worked out very well and was rather a fun recipe to try, I&#039;ve never done something similar before!   I cut the tortillas in triangles and moulded to fit, worked rather well actually. I made my own salsa, heavy on the coriander,  -- umm, otherwise, as recipe, my husband was like, wow!    We enjoyed this light dinner very much, thanks for sharing, Nancy, made for For Your Consideration YUKU tag game"
305531,508112,2014/4/22,5,Very simple and very good. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
2838738,500270,2013/5/25,4,??????? ?????????
2324285,501870,2013/8/19,4,"Very good, but so difficult to make!  My cake definitely didn&#039;t turn out looking like the photo- instead, it looked like a giant mound of ice cream mixed with a whole bunch of stuff.  The ice cream was difficult to work with when firm, and so very messy when softened.  Maybe I shouldn&#039;t have tried such a daunting recipe for my first ice cream cake!  The cake tasted great though- like a banana sundae in cake form."
2001123329,501870,2017/7/19,0,"Excellent dessert! I simplified it by making the cake in a 9 x 13 pyrex dish, mixing the bananas, butter, caramel as recipe instructed. Cutting a slice of cake for each plate, I put a big scoop of softened ice cream [I love Blue Bell Vanilla Bean] then topped with the banana mixture, sprinkled on pecans and drizzled the caramel topping on it. Very easy and delicious!"
30534,498951,2013/4/24,5,Very good! I made the recipe as directed using 1 lb of ground beef and gluten free corn bread mix. DH really liked this dish.
169430,522731,2015/8/30,5,"Oh My Heavens, this is delicious. Used the T bone and a red and a green pepper with fried okra on the side.  Easy Peasy and sure to please almost everyone, you kind of can&#039;t go wrong with this. Made for Culinary Quest 2016."
2790132,514646,2015/1/4,3,I`m giving this dish three stars because it is easy to make and made a lot. We halved the recipe and still got four servings. My family didn&#039;t care for the flavors. I Might try it again but substitute canned chopped tomatos and chilies for the salsa.
1800103479,513264,2014/2/12,5,"I like Wasabi, specially dip with other food.&lt;br/&gt;This is what I am looking for. thanks for sharing!"
944561,495821,2013/2/24,0,Good Stuff
227675,510232,2014/1/19,5,"Came together easily. Had to sub broccoli for the peas (grabbed the wrong bag in the frozen section! The addition of bacon may seem a bit odd, but let me tell ya, it makes all of the difference in the world. Thanks for sharing ChefDLH and Ree! Will make again!"
2000282130,510232,2015/6/20,0,This dish is delicious. I do question that 1 and 1/2 lbs of thin spaghetti. I cooked that much and threw at least half of it away. Is this a typo?
1802636110,514966,2014/4/1,5,You like potatoes and you like eggs put them together in this bake and die happy and fulfilled!
1802636361,514966,2014/4/1,5,Easy to make low carb meal.  Thank you.
1802641357,514966,2014/4/4,5,"I&#039;m a definite egg lover, and this recipe is right up my alley!&lt;br/&gt;The tasty combo of the eggs with the potatoes is a great meal, no matter what time of the day. &lt;br/&gt;As a breakfast lover, I tend to lean towards a early morning meal for this recipe, but I could definitely see myself eating it whenever! Bravo!"
2001836683,536603,2018/8/14,0,"Where is the rest of the recipe? How about instructions, on putting the sandwich together? Are the sweet potatoes cooked? The picture shows red onions, no mention of them in the list of ingredients...."
1802641380,514966,2014/4/4,0,This recipe took a little more time and effort but it was well worth the effort. I my wife and a close friend really enjoyed this recipe and would highly recommend it to other. it was an excellent blend of ingredients that turned out quite well.
8901114,514966,2014/4/4,5,"So delicious! Easy and quick to make, which is always a plus for me!"
1802642500,514966,2014/4/4,5,It&#039;s simple and quite tasty. The only tweak I would recommend is to omit the butter and use the bacon fat to cook the peppers in. That way you could add some smoked provolone or Parmesan and still keep it to 5 ingredients. It&#039;s a solid base to build from if you are open to using more than 5 ingredients.
1802643348,514966,2014/4/5,5,"Amazing. I live by myself and I usually cook a big batch that allows for leftovers. This recipe is quick, easy and delicious."
1802646004,514966,2014/4/6,5,"Big fan of brunch.  Loved this recipe and how the yolk stayed nice and runny when you cut into it.  I made it this morning and was a little fearful of only having 5 ingredients but my family and I were quite pleased.  It had everything we normally eat (potatoes, eggs over easy, bacon) all in one delicious dish....my kids even ate the yummy red peppers!  Creative and fun!  Will be making this again!"
1802647620,514966,2014/4/6,5,"Not only is this dish absolutely delicious, the presentation is spectacular.  Beyond 5 stars!!!"
1802647699,514966,2014/4/6,5,This is more than breakfast or brunch ---  great for any time of day ---  a quick and easy dinner w/tastes that blend very well together!!!
1802649497,514966,2014/4/7,5,Yum yum yum!!!!!!!!!!!
1802649603,514966,2014/4/7,5,Love brunch and this recipe was easy to put together as well as taste good!
1802649676,514966,2014/4/7,5,"This was a very tasty Sunday breakfast. My son loved it and so did I. The Simply Potato slices made this quicker and easier. Thank you, we will try this again for sure!"
1802636976,514966,2014/4/7,5,"I don&#039;t like cooking, and rarely spend time in the kitchen following recipes. That being said, this recipe is so easy to follow and yields the most delicious food ever! My family couldn&#039;t believe that I had made this myself, and I was very pleased! Five stars!"
1802649705,514966,2014/4/7,5,"I helped my dad make this delicious recipe for breakfast this morning. I like helping cook and this was pretty easy, and very yummy!"
1802649708,514966,2014/4/7,5,This was so amazing and easy to make.  My family loved it and it will be a favorite in our house.
1802649713,514966,2014/4/7,5,I plan on adding this recipe to my weekly meal ideas.
1802649716,514966,2014/4/7,5,"As someone who loves potatoes and bacon, this recipe was fantastic! Plus the addition of the egg really makes for a tasty treat. I tried this at a potluck and everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again in the future!"
1802649720,514966,2014/4/7,5,My kids rarely ever agree on anything I serve them. All 3 loved this and asked me to make it again. Preparation was easy and the results were fantastic.
1802649734,514966,2014/4/7,5,"This made a delicious Monday brunch. I am not much of the cooker, but had all the ingredients already in my kitchen, so i could not have said no. and boy am i happy that i didn&#039;t. My kids were actually impressed and pleased. totally will be using this again!"
1802649741,514966,2014/4/7,5,So yummy! My husband loved it too and we will be making this again soon.
1802650202,514966,2014/4/7,5,Delicious recipe. Have to try this.
1802650237,514966,2014/4/7,5,"Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"
1802650342,514966,2014/4/7,5,"Are there really words to describe this taste sensation? Yes, here are some: crunchy, salty, sweet, smokey, rich, damn-fine, yee-haw! I made two alterations because I can&#039;t resist tinkering: a little granulated garlic sprinkled over the potatoes and some cheese. Everything needs garlic and cheese because this is America, damn it! I opted for Havarti, not because it was the best choice but it WAS what I had in the fridge."
636973,514966,2014/4/7,5,This recipe is so easy and delicious! An impressive brunch dish that takes minimal effort and just a few ingredients that I almost always have on hand. I will be using this one again and again.
1802650762,514966,2014/4/7,5,"Oh. My. Goodness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made this last night for my darling, and it was epic! I plan to try this often in the future with perhaps just a few tweaks/experiments. Thanks!!"
1802650852,514966,2014/4/7,0,"Not being much of a cook, i tried this recipe and found the directions very simple and easy to follow.  The result was beyond expectations -- delicious and a hit with my friends!  Will definitely make this again."
1802652474,514966,2014/4/8,5,This made for the best brunch yet!  I loved it&#039;s crispy and sweet flavor and it was such an easy recipe to follow.  Delicious!
1802652479,514966,2014/4/8,5,"I was looking for a breakfast casserole recipe, and I am glad I chose this one. The proportions of eggs, potatoes, and bacon were just right."
1802654824,514966,2014/4/9,5,Just tried making this for dinner and it was a home run! Thanks for the great recipe :)))
2585084,499710,2013/5/11,5,"This was my first attempt at baking a cheese cake.  The directions were easy to follow.  I was pleasantly surprised at how light this cake was. I really was expecting it to be heavy. It tasted delicious, and was so pretty."
204024,515492,2014/5/7,5,The lasagna was delicious.  Loved all the cheeses combined with sauce and noodles.   It did no fit into my 7x11 pan easily.  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
724631,504151,2014/4/30,4,"The avocado sauce and the coleslaw mix tasted awesome!  The fish tasted good and normal (an opportunity here to &quot;blacken&quot;).  Several times the recipe called for salt and pepper; the recipe could be improved to give quantities, as I wondered what I would end up with.  For the flour mix, the amount of flour could be reduced to 1/2 cup and still have enough for easy coverage; in Step 5 specific amounts were given but these were not listed among the ingredients (I like to line up my ingredients in order of use like a countdown).  It would be helpful if Step 7 gave some estimated cooking times.  I was very impressed with the avocado sauce that didn&#039;t blacken while standing and that allowed me to cover a good bit of the tortilla.  The coleslaw mix began to get soggy; the carrots would have stayed crisper had I used my old-fashioned grater rather than the new Microplane grater which grates too finely for this purpose.  For half a recipe&#039;s worth of coleslaw mix, I used 4 drops of Crystal hot sauce, and wished I had used a drop more for a bit more tang.  I don&#039;t remember 2 toppings such as the avocado sauce and the coleslaw mix that excited me as much on previous fish tacos, so I will definitely revisit this recipe!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2001290215,529041,2016/12/10,0,How long do you bake this for and at what temperature? the puff pastry sheets I have- say cook according to recipe and this recipe does not specify. Thanks!
1800698944,529041,2016/12/17,0,Can you prep this ahead and bake a few hours later
1020526,512455,2015/2/4,5,"I found this recipe in Taste of Home Contest Winning Annual Recipes 2010.  Oh boy howdy was it delicious.  I don&#039;t even like chocolate, but this is terrific.  Thanks for posting!"
2690500,494623,2013/2/12,0,This was amazing! The lime zest made the fish crispy like it had been breaded and fried. We made extra and ate all of it in one sitting. The lime on the spinach was very tart. I recommend tasting as you pour the juice. It was very good as well. <br/>Went to Trader Joe's and bought more tilapia. Making it again tonight. First time ever that my husband asked for more fish.
2324285,494623,2013/10/20,4,"Very good and loaded with coconut &amp; lime flavors.  The spinach especially tasted good with the lime- who knew that flavors would go well together.  A good recipe, and easy to prepare."
2002034798,503933,2018/3/6,5,"Love it, Love it!! It is so easy too. The trick is to let them cool first instead of freaking out thinking they are burnt ??! Then the cheese will stick to the potatoes, a must have, everyone will love it too! A lil sour cream on the side...yeah!"
1800133143,499736,2013/10/18,4,my dogs loved this. i did run out of rice flour and used gluten free pizza flour for one batch  and sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin. but they loved it.. thanks for recipe!!
2324285,511332,2014/1/2,4,"Very good.  This tastes like mac &amp; cheese, but with quinoa instead of pasta.  I used almost twice as much cheese, and I wish the servings were larger- but it was quite tasty."
361931,503874,2013/7/26,4,"I made a half batch, and I liked the addition of the cajun spice here, but I had to add more mayo/mustard than called for to get the consitency I really liked.  I didn&#039;t measure it -- but I guarentee it was much more than called for here (for a half batch!).  Though otherwise very good!!  And egg salad (for me) is better the next day once the flavors meld together!  :)"
305531,503874,2013/9/6,5,Yum. I made 1/2 of the recipe for 2 of us and we both really enjoyed this. The only bad part is that I kept losing my egg salad while eating it because of the slippery tomato. lol. Thanks Dr. Jenny for a nice lunch. Made for ZWT9.
2922466,503874,2013/11/22,5,"This was very good! I really like the kick the Cajun spice added! Like another reviewer said, don&#039;t use salt and pepper if salt is one of the first ingredients in your Cajun spice bottle. I tasted it while combining it and it was a little salty so I didn&#039;t add any s&amp;p. I left it in the fridge for a half hour and when I ate it with the lettuce and tomato it tasted perfect! Thanks for a great sandwich!"
2668584,493417,2013/1/31,4,"It was good. I modified it a little. In the future I would use a little less coconut milk. I added a little more soy and lime juice. I also added bean sprouts and cilantro, and substituted the onion for a little onion powder (not a huge fan of it). I had to substitute chili paste for another ingredient I didn't have. But overall I was happy, lol."
43152381,519120,2017/10/24,0,It turned out great! I was a big hit at a party I attended a couple of months ago.
2002146734,519120,2018/5/9,0,How many meatballs does it make
204024,503098,2014/4/26,5,This made great quick breakfast this morning.  Love strawberry banana flavor combinations.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
128473,503098,2014/4/29,5,"Thank you for sharing your recipe Samoan Cook.  It was really quick and easy to make, with great results.  I really enjoy strawberries and bananas mixed together and this sweet treat does not disappoint.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
128473,493499,2013/2/8,5,"I love grilled cheese sandwiches and this one is the bomb.  Really enjoyed the caramelized onion and bbq sauce in this sandwich, so much flavor, it is the perfect pairing.  It was so quick and easy to make, the perfect comfort food, it satisfys everyone in the family. Thanks so much for sharing yet another tasty treat gailanng."
242794,528122,2017/11/8,5,Exactly the recipe I was looking for. Had this in Ireland and loved!! Thank you.
560491,503098,2014/4/29,5,Very tasty!  I used frozen strawberries and a super ripe banana. I like that there is not a lot of sugar in it either.  Made for DS and I for breakfast and it was filling enough to hold us over until lunch.  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
2002252447,503098,2018/8/20,5,"It was very good, I just doubled the recipe to have more and it still turned out amazing! Would totally recommend. ??"
2791643,496572,2013/4/19,5,This was delicious and easy.  I didn&#039;t have a pie crust and it still served like a piece of pie.  Great with the BBQ Sauce!  I&#039;ll be making this again.
58104,501774,2013/7/4,5,Refreshingly delicious! I skipped the watercress. Used red onion. Loved the herb mixture.
239758,527455,2016/7/17,5,"Oh yum! I made this exactly as written, using king prawns that I bought on special at the markets. At first I thought the batter was too thick, but it cooked up fine. Served with a spicy sauce, rather than sweet and sour, which is not a popular flavour in our household."
386585,499140,2014/4/27,5,"Beside being super simple to make, this earns 5 stars for flavor!  I served this as a dip with crudite, and it was just gobbled up.  If to be used as dressing, I think it could be thinned out a tad bit more, as it is very thick.  I did use 1-1/2 t. garlic powder, which punched up the flavor for sure!  Thanks for sharing this keeper.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
204024,499140,2015/1/25,4,This made a good dip for our coffee time at church.  We served it with a tray of vegetables.  I didn&#039;t add extra garlic just used the full amount.    Made for 2014 Favorites.
369715,502040,2013/7/11,4,This was good and easy to make. I used a 12 ounce box of ziti and 2 cups of mozz cheese but other then that I followed the recipe. We all enjoyed this.
440735,503633,2013/7/18,5,"Great recipe! I am not a fan of Jambalaya but this was the best one I have cooked! There was only one package of andouille sausage at the store if you can believe that. I used some turkey kielbasa to fufill the pound of sausage needed. I am glad I did because the dish was spicy (which is great) but not kid friendly. I didn&#039;t use the full amount of cayenne pepper either for this reason. Overall, great dish!  Made for ZWT9 July 2013."
2001847495,503633,2017/12/9,5,"I found this recipe a few years ago... it is a winter time staple for us. My husband doesn't like left overs, but he'll eat this one as a left over until it is all gone! Make it with sweet yellow cornbread and white rice! Yummtastic. I do not use the spicey sausage, I use a skinless sausage available in the lunch meat case!"
67728,512553,2014/5/11,5,"This didn&#039;t come out quite as good at the pizza we get a Giordanos when we visit family in Chicago, but definitely pizzeria quality nonetheless! I used hot italian sausage and sliced button mushrooms in mine, and I mixed some drained crushed tomatoes with some fresh pizza sauce that I had made the day before for the tomato part. The crust tasted a tiny bit flat, so I think I might add a bit more salt next time I make this, but otherwise it was perfect. My pie was pretty loose when I took it out of the oven, so I waited about 30 minutes to cut into it so it wouldn&#039;t be too sloppy to eat. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
804550,512553,2014/11/24,5,"We were just in Chicago in June of this year to repeat a trip to Gino&#039;s East. The crust on this pie wasn&#039;t exactly like that but the dough was excellent in its own right. In fact I&#039;m going to try it as a regular pizza pie. Honestly, it was the first dough I have Ever had any success in forming it into a pizza without it looking like a kindergarten craft project. I used two types of chicken sausage store made from the Italian market in Hammonton, NJ. It worked out great in this recipe."
236561,512553,2015/7/11,5,"Using this process of preheating oven with pizza stone and aluminum foil is JUST what I&#039;ve been needing to make my pizza the BEST! The dough cooked nicely without burning and the cheese melted just as it should. My dough recipe calls for 3/4 c finely grouned corn meal which is a must if you want it to taste like Chicago style, according to those restauranteers who make it locally in Chicago. I also add about 1T salt to give it that taste that none other has!"
2000649431,512553,2015/11/7,5,"I agree with Elizabeth about the pizza stone and aluminum foil.  I had tried numerous DDP recipes without the success I got from this recipe.  I think using a pizza stone under the pan and aluminum foil above the are crucial in achieving balanced cooking of all the ingredients.

Nordicware makes a beefy 9&quot; round aluminum cake pan that works great for DDP.  It&#039;s 2.5&quot; deep, giving plenty of room for additional ingredients."
2001904534,512553,2018/1/1,5,Really delicious and simple. I added pepperoni and chopped mushrooms but still perfect.
2001908957,512553,2018/1/3,0,Thank you for posting this awesome recepie. I used 6 in 1 crushed tomatoes and the result was great. Some online comments have claimed that this is the brand used by Giordano's. I do have a request. Could you please post the recepie to make the crushed tomatoes sauce like the one Lou malnatis and UNO use?
80353,505745,2013/8/22,5,"Scaled this down to 2 servings and really just blanched my carrots quickly as I wanted them very crisp.  The dressing is lovely and fresh and the harissa adds its special North African nuance, but not so much so that it dominates.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe. :-)"
2001380387,530190,2017/2/14,5,This is delicious! Added a bag of mixed frozen veggies after because I didn't have broccoli so picture is not as aesthetically pleasing as the one from blog but this is definitely a must!! Only thing I recommend is mixing the cornstarch in some water before pouring it in to the saucepan because before I mixed it in with water the little bit I DID put in there was clumped up on me big time so I had to use a strainer to declumo after the fact. But with the diluted cornstarch it worked so well!
128473,501177,2013/6/21,5,"We really enjoyed this tasty dish, arrrr, it had loads of flavor and was truly outstanding.  I made this tasty dish exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing. All the flavors complimented one another beautifully. Great use of contest ingredients.  Good luck in the Contest."
1706426,501177,2013/6/24,3,"We didn&#039;t much care for this dish. We found it was bland and uninteresting to us. I think it would be better if used with real cream, although I know evaporated milk was a  must use ingredient forth contest. It is definitely worth playing with though! Thanks for posting!"
323186,501177,2013/7/10,5,"We enjoyed this, Annacia, very good.  I didnt realise asparagus were out of season and hideously expensive, so I wrestled with my budget and decided to use zucchini, cut into batons, instead, please forgive me!   I think that this would be great with asparagus!  I did add a sprinkling of dried chilli flakes, simply because I enjoy them and thought it might be a nice addition, I liked it :).    Otherwise as recipe, this was a good supper dish and I will most certainly make this again!  Thanks for posting, made for PRMR tag game."
169430,503139,2014/3/5,5,"I made this subbing Meyer lemon for the orange because I had a bag that needed using and no oranges, lol. It came out great and makes a coffee or tea partner as well as a snack cake. It&#039;s not light as a cloud but it doesn&#039;t need to be, it has a delicious substance that you sink your fork and teeth into with a smile and enjoy each bite. Oh, and I used Splenda for the sugar."
2001065382,531516,2017/7/8,0,This is FAR too complicated to not have ANY photos of the cake! At least one showing the finished product would have HELPED. How about the piping? Very poor publishing.
2001004245,531516,2017/7/9,5,I have yet to make this recipe but I am definitely going to try! Its absolutely beautiful and sounds amazing! The pictures you've posted are great and I hope mine turns out half as lovely as yours! Thank you for the idea! I love peach season!
2001227181,531516,2017/7/9,4,This is really good but I tweaked it a bit. See them under tweaks.
2001620476,531516,2017/7/10,5,We made this for my daughters sweet 16 and oh boy this cake is over the top sweet. I'd make it again. We did change the biscuit recipe and I wish I had seen the whipped cream tweak for frosting because the buttercream gave us diabetes.
2222537,531516,2017/7/10,0,"The peach pound cake recipe calls for peached, but in the directions, it does not say when to add them."
2001246895,531516,2017/7/17,5,"Awesome recipe! However I changed a few things - only used 12 g of baking soda because the first batch was SO bitter. Couldn't find peach sorbet so I used strawberry, and used only regular vanilla. Used whipped topping for icing, per someone else's review and thank goodness - it would have been way too sweet. The caramel sauce was amazing and the pound cake was lovely. Would make again"
865936,498196,2013/4/14,3,"The dressing was delicious when I first made it. In fact, all the way to work I was thinking of other salads, etc to use it on. However, when it came time to eat it (6 hours later), it was impossibly hot. I recommend that you not let this salad sit, but instead, serve it right away."
780172,509252,2013/11/18,5,"A nice refreshing salad, love the dressing. The oranges, apples and nuts make it a great salad."
165623,509252,2014/1/14,5,We loved this! By the time I went to make this the spinach had gone bad so we had to leave that out and no raspberry vinegar so I used rice vinegar and fresh raspberries. We will defiantly have this again.
461834,509252,2015/1/21,5,Very nice mix of flavors!!  I scaled this back to 1/4 of the recipe and didn&#039;t opt to use the kiwi fruit.  The dressing is very flavorful and the crunch from the pecans and apples provide for great texture.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for &quot;For your Consideration Tag Game&quot;
1436160,509252,2015/12/31,5,We really enjoyed this salad. Did not use kiwi and subbed toasted almond slivers for the pecans. The vinaigrette is light with a hint of citrus and sweetness. Thanks for sharing!
226867,509252,2017/12/22,5,"A very refreshing &quot;winter&quot; salad! I only had spinach, which was a great combination with the fruit. (Can't wait to use fresh strawberries when that time comes around again!) Made for your football win 2017"
163112,503217,2013/8/9,3,"Eh, in the end they were tasty enough.  The directions don&#039;t specify adding the milk.  That seemed like a lot of cheese but of the 8 oz block I used, I had probably 2-3 oz left.  These reheated well for lunch today.  I used frozen spinach that I defrosted in the microwave then squeezed.  I kept thinking it needed *something* such as an herb or spice or even just a bit more salt.  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
1925885,532739,2017/7/28,5,"We loved this salad served at room temperature. I did cut back on the sugar, as it seemed too much - we used less than a teaspoon and it was perfect! I must admit I had my doubts about the lemon drizzle, but it wouldn't have been the same without it. Delicious! Thanks for posting. Made for CQ4 play, Team Happy Campers."
1271506,532739,2017/8/1,5,"With our own strain of Asian spearmint and our neighbor's perfect green beans, we made this recipe to accompany the grilled steak we indulge ourselves with occasionally. The combination was fabulous!"
865936,532739,2017/8/6,5,We really enjoyed that flavors in this dish.
1123943,493096,2013/1/15,5,"I tried this recipe because I had some frozen butternut squash in the freezer which I knew would shorten the preparation time. You can now find prepared butternut squash in the fresh produce department of your grocery stores.This recipe does not require any exotic ingredients but it gives a great flavourful stew for limited effort. My family loved it served as suggested on couscous. I added alot more cilantro because the flavour is so fresh, otherwise I made the recipe as is. This one is a keeper!!"
368078,508302,2014/1/24,0,"Yumm!!  After reading the first review, I added 3T of sugar instead of the 2T as listed.  I thought it was perfect and it reminded me that in my other mug recipes, the sugar to flour ratio is typically the same (so for me it made sense to increase it).  It was yummy and sweet...just like a sugar cookie! :)  Will definitely make again."
1802428568,508302,2014/1/29,5,"I followed both these suggestions, added 3T of sugar and sprinkled some sugar on the top.  Yummy!  I also didn&#039;t have any white flour, so I used 2T almond flour and 1T coconut flour.  It worked out great!"
182290,508302,2014/2/15,5,"I made it exactly as written, except I dusted the top with granulated sugar because I didn&#039;t have sprinkles. I was tempted to increase the sugar, but I wanted to rate the recipe exactly as it was written so I didn&#039;t. While it did taste like a sugar cookie and was VERY satisfying, I think I could have handled having an extra tablespoon of sugar in it. It was sweet as is, but I have a really big sweet tooth. I will try it that way next time, but thanks for the dessert. Super easy and super fast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE! I have been playing with this recipe. Yes, it is definitely better with 3 TBP of sugar. Also, I looked at a chocolate cookie recipe on pinterest and made some changes to this recipe as a combo of the two for a yummy chocolate cookie/brownie treat. Changes are: 2 and 1/2 TBP of sugar, no egg yolk, 1 tsp of oil, 2 tsp of milk, 2 tsp of cocoa. Microwave for 45 seconds, then an additional 10 seconds, very very light sprinkle of salt and then sprinkle with confectioners sugar. (Leave out the salt if you don&#039;t like salty chocolate.) DELISH!"
1802819099,508302,2014/6/12,1,plz dont get tricked it taste like a bad pancake
42857857,508302,2014/9/22,0,i found that if i cooked it for 30 seconds that it was still to dry so i found that 25 seconds is more preferable for my taste bud!
1803233595,508302,2014/10/16,5,"OKAY. LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING. I made an account on this website solely for the purpose of reviewing this cookie. I mean, yeah. I&#039;ll probably use it in the future for something. But take a moment to sit down, stare at a wall, turn on some intense music, and let that sink in. I used a whole five minutes of my ever-dwindling life to sign up for this website just so I could review this cookie. I could have been sleeping. I could have been watching children and puppies play in a park. I could have been enjoying the great outdoors. I could have been saving lives. Instead, I chose to write this review. WITH THAT IN MIND, let it be known that you have just casually stumbled upon the holy grail of microwave cooking. Now, I have been cooking ridiculous things in the microwave for quite a long time now. I have no idea why. Sometimes I theorize that it is more that I am amused by the fact that I can cook something in the microwave that does not taste like a shoe than the fact that I am actually hungry or in want of a dessert. Naturally, when I noticed last week that I had neither the brown sugar nor cocoa powder necessary to recreate either of the recipes I usually go for, I became desperate. So desperate, in fact, that I actually overcame my tendency to lie on the floor and make strange noises when faced with adversity and took to Google to find another recipe that called for neither of those ingredients. Now, initially, I was a bit hesitant -- ever since the Great Gravity-Defying Egg Incident of 2012, I had been wary of microwave recipes involving eggs in any capacity (not to mention the fact that even so much as slight eggy flavor in anything but. uh. an egg. is, in my humble opinion, the nastiest thing in the world). But for some reason, I saw in this recipe the very image of hope and prosperity. Without further ado, I began frantically mixing flour, sugar, butter, and everything else. For good measure, I threw in probably more butterscotch chips than anyone has any business consuming in one sitting. I then placed my concoction in the microwave and said a silent prayer to the microwave gods that I would not be let down. Needless to say, I was very pleased with the outcome. I have since made it two additional time, once substituting my butterscotch chips for mini m&amp;ms. I have no regrets. Please make this cookie. Yes, some people have said that it &quot;tastes like a bad pancake.&quot; Some people have also said that the Earth is flat. If you want to lead a fulfilling life, you would be wise to get up right now and go make this. Please. It is truly inspiring."
1803317129,508302,2014/11/19,5,"Honestly, this is delicious!&lt;br/&gt;I was, sincerely, worried about the ONLY bad review about this- I&#039;m a negative person. But I decided to try it anyways, because I had nothing better to eat in the afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;Let me say that even though I cooked it 1:30 instead of 45 seconds (because my electricity sucks because the guy next door has this weird machine that consumes lots of power), it was fluffy when I took it out of the microwave! &lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m not a big fan of vanilla essence, but the smell that this had was just AWESOME! &lt;br/&gt;Also I&#039;m a little bit slow eating hot things so by the time it cooled down (3-4 minutes after I took it out of the microwave) it was a little bit dry/hard on the bottom, but I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s due to me overcooking it in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;Awesome recipe!"
1803437671,508302,2014/11/29,1,Was excited to try this as craving a cookie and it&#039;s too dangerous to have dozens of them sitting around. Sorry but it was awful. Very eggy in taste and cake like as in a fat pancake. Not sweet at all nor did it even come close to a sugar cookie. Now my tummy hurts from trying it. I will forge on to make my own recipe.
2000054924,508302,2015/3/10,5,"Really, really, really satisfying. Thank you food.com for curing my sweet tooth without forcing me to make a whole batch!"
2000134282,508302,2015/4/12,0,"OMG, let me tell you.........this was amazing! The most perfect &quot;mug cookie&quot; ever! I did one adjustment, I used almond flavoring instead of vanilla (I&#039;m LOVE almonds) thank you for posting this!!"
2000137594,508302,2015/4/13,5,Let&#039;s get one thing straight. I only came here to get some stupid recipe for cookie dough that wouldn&#039;t take forever. I didn&#039;t cook this. SO there I am it&#039;s 4am and the worst craving for cookie dough comes outta nowhere. BAM! I need something but it&#039;s 4 am and I don&#039;t wanna drive. SO I calmly start looking for recipes online when suddenly genius strikes and I decide to look up cookie in a mug. Genius!! I have a mug and I need a cookie. I make the stupid recipe. I eat the cookie dough....(as our lord had intended us to do) Now I have heartburn like nobody&#039;s business but I have absolutely no regrets. This cookie dough was amazing. Don&#039;t listen to these haters try it.
2000201213,508302,2015/5/13,5,"I had a crazy sugar cookie craving and found this recipe...let me tell you - this was the most awesome and convenient cookie recipe I have come across! I prepared it with a minor alteration of adding another tbsp. of sugar. Also, I did not have any sprinkle to top it off so I actually added a drop of red food coloring to give it a cutesy look and topped it with some strawberry cheesecake ice cream once it was cooled a little - talk about a little piece of dessert heaven! this can also serve as a good base for other mug cookie recipes so I will try out some different alterations and see what I can come up with."
2000204018,508302,2015/5/14,1,"I know that usually cookies in a mug or cakes in a mug don&#039;t turn out right. I read the reviews and there was only one bad one out of twelves so I decided to give it a shot... I first did it as the recipe says. I was not happy. So I tried it again, adding the extra sugar like a few of the reviews suggested. And my conclusion is:

I agree with the person who says it tasted like a bad pancake... I was so beyond disappointed that I made an account just so that no one else gets fooled by this recipe. I mean it may satisfy a craving for sweetness, but seriously you are better off going to the store and buying cookie dough or making your own cookie dough and baking it in the oven!"
2000270901,508302,2015/6/15,4,"Enthusiasm Personified got to me a few months ago and made me want to try this recipe after my mom got on my phone and deleted the tab i had open for this awesome chocolate chip cookie mug recipe. i made it exactly as written, except that i cooked it for more like 30 seconds and then like 3 seconds a couple times because microwaveable baked goods get dry pretty quickly if overcooked. anyways! i topped it with chocolate chips and it was everything you could hope for in a morcowaved cookie. ive just made this for a second time but this time topped with white chocolate chips! i hate white chocolate but i dont have any othet kind arond. anyway, its still just as good, as expected. 
protip: dont forget to spray the mug with nonstick stuff or youll cry. 
secondary protip: check to make sure your milk is expired before drinking it with this cookie or anything else."
2000400300,508302,2015/8/13,5,This recipie is delicious! All microwaves are different so mine came out more like a cake than a cookie...
2000430949,508302,2015/8/26,5,just made this cookie with chocolate at the centre..... amazing :D
2000431901,508302,2015/9/7,4,"If you&#039;re making this expecting it to taste just like (and have the same texture of) a sugar cookie, you&#039;ll be disappointed. But if you&#039;re making this for a quick single serve dessert, or as a fun cooking activity with your toddler who got severely burned the last time you made cookies in the oven (yep that&#039;s me), then this is a perfect recipe for you. We really enjoyed it!"
2000485153,508302,2015/9/19,1,"One of the worst mug cookie recipes I&#039;ve found to date. The raw dough was okay, but once it was microwaved it smelled and tasted like a sponge."
2000727115,508302,2015/12/4,1,There is far too much butter in this cookie. I couldn&#039;t even eat it. All I could taste was butter.
2000902204,508302,2016/3/4,5,"I was really skeptical about this recipe, because every other brownie or cookie in a mug recipe that i&#039;ve tried has come out like mush, but this one actually worked! I used honey butter instead of regular butter, but everything else I did just as the recipe called for. When it finished cooking, it smelled absolutely amazing, and it tasted great as well. I highly recommend this recipe!"
2001098316,508302,2016/7/22,4,"Meh. When I first found this recipe, I was awed by the sheer determination of ENTHUSIASM PERSONIFIED and I felt inspired to do this recipe. Though at first the taste is strange, it grows on you when you realize that it is your only option. So while it is not as amazing as ENTHUSIASM PERSONIFIED claims, it does not taste like a bad pancake."
2001232509,508302,2016/11/4,5,it was very yummy! but it turned out more like a cake than a cookie and we had to cook it for one minute instead of 45 seconds.
2001255468,508302,2016/11/20,5,i love it but do some cakes in a cup plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
2001271318,508302,2016/11/26,1,Did not work at all I cooked it for 1 minute then 2 then 3 would not cool throughly at all
2001272559,508302,2016/11/27,5,"Me and my sister made these for breakfast this morning. I know, it seems weird, but sometimes you gotta have something sweet for breakfast. We took the advice from the comments and added an extra tablespoon of sugar. We also mixed in our sprinkles, instead of just putting them on top. It turned out great! It was a tad sweet, I didn't exactly know if I could eat it all, but it satisfied my craving! Thanks for this recipe!"
2001308875,508302,2016/12/20,4,I'm not sure if it was the recipe or me Update- I did it again and it worked. I would up of to 3 tablespoons of sugar though
2001316922,508302,2016/12/23,2,Not what I was expecting. I thought I would end up with a cookie. Baked at 45 seconds I ended up with a cup full of warm sweet pudding. Baked at 1 min. I ended up with a warm sweet lump with the consistency of playdough. Would have been great as a pudding though.
2001346584,508302,2017/1/11,0,when do i add the egg? nvm its a gloopy cookie
2001352136,508302,2017/1/15,5,"I gave up chocolate for the new year, so I've been looking for a sweet dessert to fill that gap. This was so easy and so satisfying. It was the perfect moisture and the perfect cooking time. This is one of the best microwave desserts I've had the pleasure of making. Moral of the story: Make this cookie because WOW"
2001424975,508302,2017/3/9,3,"It is cake. Followed directions perfectly, it's not even sweet haha. Oh well I wanted something as a dessert so this will suffice."
2001432640,508302,2017/3/13,4,"As someone else said, if you're expecting an oven baked sugar cookie, well.. go bake them in the oven. If you're craving something sweet and don't have anything else/don't want to bake, this will probably satisfy you. I made it and thought it tasted bad at first, but then I took another bite, and another, and honestly it's decent for the amount of effort put into it. Just get rid of that expectation of it tasting like an oven baked sugar cookie, because it won't. It's more on the cake-y side, mine took about 1:15-1:30 to cook all the way through and was still a bit soft. Maybe I could have cooked it a little more, or done some tweaking. But overall decent for a late night (or early morning) sweet tooth."
2001437691,508302,2017/3/15,5,"It's amazing! Sure, it wasn't like some oven-baked cookie, I wasn't expecting that(it was a bit cakey). But either way, it was easy to make. I'm horrible at baking, but it turned out pretty edible! It's really easy to make. :D"
2001456130,508302,2017/3/26,5,"I made this, I added a 1/2 tbs more sugar, used maple syrup instead of vanilla, and used vegetable oil instead of egg. Turned out crumbly, but delicious! Maybe using a little more butter will help next time, but it worked well."
2001528279,508302,2017/5/9,0,just a hint: when making a double batch it looks all watery on top ignore it either it happened to you or the cookie doesn't like me so ya buh bye
2001552440,508302,2017/5/24,0,So good it actually works like a charm
2001591401,508302,2017/6/19,3,I followed the recipe but it turned out to be more like a cake than a cookie for me.
2001602316,508302,2017/6/27,0,"My cookie was very doughy, probably bc the difference in microwaves, so I put some ice cream on it. It was also a very small amount of cookie"
2001685759,508302,2017/8/24,0,my cookie turned out spongy... what should i do next time in order to make it nice?
2001713299,508302,2017/9/13,5,"Okay, I'm 11 weeks pregnant and my cravings for cookies has been OFF THE WALL. I wanted something super easy and that didn't require a lot of ingredients and THIS was definitely it. ?? I almost didn't try it because I made a peanut butter cookie in a mug and it was a disaster. lol but this one surprised me! It really does taste like a sugar cookie. I followed the recipe exactly, but sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon on top. I also microwaved for 45 sec. &amp; it came out perfect! Will def be making again :)"
2001801981,508302,2017/11/17,5,It was so good and easy to make! Made one for myself and one for my husband we then we put Cadbury Caramel on top omg it was amazing!
2001816803,508302,2017/11/22,1,Worst thing ever
2001939156,508302,2018/1/18,0,"i made a few substitutions to better suit my dietary preferences! i substituted the sugar for coconut sugar, butter for coconut oil, and vanilla for regular soy milk and added just a medium sized drop of honey! It was wonderful! I only had to microwave mine for about 35 seconds, 40-45 was just a bit too much with my microwave"
2001963630,508302,2018/1/30,5,"I added brown sugar, Himalayan salt, and pink sparkles, it turned out amazing!! It actually turned out better than my previous dinosaur shaped sugar cookies!"
2001978379,508302,2018/2/7,3,UHHH... definitely not a cookie! it turned into a yellow cake ... still tastes good though but the title is a little misleading...
2002186349,508302,2018/6/14,5,yum!!!!!!!
2002196036,508302,2018/6/23,5,"I added 3 tablespoons of Hershey's cocoa mix, and another tablespoon of sugar and it was heaven on earth!!!"
2002240938,508302,2018/8/6,4,this wasn't to bad of a recipe I think it turned out really good when you don't have much ingredients and you want to quit sweet treat it hits the spot I even left out and I had mini chocolate chips and I put it on the top it was really good.
2002242401,508302,2018/8/8,1,"I tried making it, maybe I did something wrong but, it wasn't sweet at all and the taste was weird."
2001461194,508302,2018/8/17,5,"One of the best you’ll ever eat! It was during that time of the month and my cravings were extra high, so I wanted a cookie. FYI, this is a cake type cookie. If you want a cookie, bake one. But it’s great, and the flavor is to die for! I did at some point have a problem with the cookie being spongy because of the egg. I suggest adding a tablespoon of milk. It taste just as good, plus you don’t have to worry about ending up with a spongy consistency. Also, add a pinch of sugar on top. It’ll bring you to heaven!"
2002262209,508302,2018/8/31,0,"I didnt have any sprinkles, so I dont know if that contributed to the lack of sweetness..I'd add a little more sugar if I made it again. I also added a little bit of water."
204024,496317,2013/4/13,5,I made these and baked them but I am making them for a fundraiser dinner tomorrow night.  They acted exactly like my fudgey brownie recipe.  Made for PAC Spring 2013.
486725,514088,2015/2/9,5,"Restaurant quality, just delicious. I did not use the oil (you don&#039;t really need to with the skin side down first) while cooking the duck. Though this was excellent, to really perfect it, next time I would halve the wine and cut the broth out entirely. You get such rich flavor making a ragu with duck, you really can&#039;t go wrong. A treat for a special occasion!"

2001655814,499871,2017/8/3,5,"This is one of our favorite summer salads. I like to make it a day ahead so it's good and firm before unmolding. In our frig it takes about three hours for the liquid ingredients to be firm enough to fold in the shrimp, celery, and green onion... otherwise all those things go right to the bottom of the mold and it falls apart when you remove it. YUM."
2000676770,524623,2015/11/14,5,Amazing! Yum!
169430,499043,2013/12/17,4,"The final outcome of this recipe gave me 4 lovely big burger buns. Can&#039;t wait to try them with a chicken burger! The short coming was that it was way short on flour amount. I used the 2 cups as ask but needed to add another 1/2 cup right away and probably another 1/4 to 1/3 cup was worked in when forming the buns  as the dough was still so wet and sticky. This has a very nice, and uncommon, chili flavor that will be good with so many things. I almost always make buns because I just can&#039;t use a load before it goes off. Thanks Mike :D. Made for Sweet December game 2013."
286566,503379,2014/11/9,5,"In the end this tasted great I used 4 ounces of butter but I felt 4 ounces of salami; I used hot Hungarian so only used 2 ounces which added a lovely spicy flavour and it wasn&#039;t till I went to put it in the oven (barbie was not an option for me) that I realized I had not put in the basil which could have made a difference but as it was still delicious,  I used a small Pane Di Casa sour dough bread and for 4 of us as a side was adequate.  Still have some butter left over (in the freezer) and will add basil to it and make this again.

133174,504711,2013/8/2,5,This is why I love ZWT!.  The dish is quite different but very good.  I used fresh rosemary from my garden.  This was served as a side dish for Recipe #464854.  Made for ZWT9.
323186,504711,2013/8/8,5,"Much enjoyed,  I didnt trouble with the honey since the pineapple was quite sweet (I liked the idea of braising it),  and I didnt have peanuts so used some raw cashews,  hope you dont mind, they did work quite well in the dish!    Very nice, thank you, Ck2plz, made for ZWT9, Hot Pink Panthers On The Prowl."
498271,504711,2013/8/11,5,"This was a pleasant surprise!  I thought it would be good but it&#039;s really terrific.  I used thyme and cashews instead of peanuts as I was using them in another dish as well.  My pineapple was pretty sweet so I didn&#039;t need to add the honey.  Really enjoyed this delightfully unusual dish - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
2002266390,536436,2018/9/4,5,Perfect dinner in the summer.

God bless you abundantly...."
39835,503674,2013/7/24,5,"Super easy and wonderful salad! I used both heirloom and regular vine tomatoes, skipping the parsley but added some lettuce and cucumber. Delish! Thanks for sharing!"
679953,511739,2014/2/23,5,"I adjusted this a bit, but kept the original recipe, first I used a cup of a-1 steak sauce, second I went with 3/4 cup BBQ sauce, and 1/4 cup ketchup, before I used the marinade I added 3 tablespoons lite beer to the marinade.  Great tasting steaks :).  Full of flavor, each had one.  A very full meal with potato salad on the side.  This marinade I did taste before adding the beer, and I would have it either way.  Great tasting.  Made for PRMR Tag."
386585,503305,2013/8/25,5,"Incredibly delicious soup that is fast and easy to make.  I made this exactly as posted, and enjoyed every mouthful.  The construction of the dish is very interesting, with the bean sprout mixture added to the bowl first, then noodles, then soup.  I posted photos of the bean sprout mixture, so you could see it clearly, and then the leftover soup, which I added the rest of the noodles too.  Made by a Tasty Tester for ZWT9."
129958,502944,2014/3/11,5,"Love this salad!   I reduced the recipe down to about 1/4 of the recipe as I was preparing it only for myself.  The only things I changed was the style of pasta and cheese.  I used mini shells and shredded cheese as this is what I had on hand.  I don&#039;t think the pasta made a difference in the taste, but the cheese probably did.  Next time I will definitely make sure I have block cheese and cut it into cubes.  Block cheese holds  the flavor of the cheese better than pre-shredded.  I think the pops of cubed cheese with the other flavors would be even more delicious.   I used locally canned sweet spicy dill pickles and the spiciness in the pickle gave you a tickle of heat.   This is great just by the recipe, but it lends itself to personal options of flavor, such as tomatoes or avocado.  Thanks Dave#7!"
1803691975,520522,2015/1/22,5,I gave this recipe a try ahead of time because I want Valentine&#039;s Day to be special. I found this recipe to be spot on! Would not change a thing.
135566,503731,2014/4/20,5,"I appreciate short-cut recipes to speed up cooking time and this worked very well.  I made one large 12-ounce baking potato to split between two people. 10 minutes in my microwave the potato would be completely cooked, so I only nuked for 5 minutes and then popped into the oven.  Made for Spring 2014 Pick A Chef."
266635,500090,2013/5/15,5,"Delicious way to prepare mushrooms.  So easy to make and they have a great flavor.  The only change I would make next time is to reduce the dressing mix by half as we found them a little salty for our tastes.  I used unsalted butter so I think reducing the mix will make them less salty.  Definitely a keeper.  Made for PRMR, May, 2013."
636915,500090,2013/6/13,5,"This recipe is soooooo good and sooooo easy!  I have made it twice now, but without the parmesan cheese, and my husband will start eating them before the cook time is up!  If you like saut&eacute;ed mushrooms, this is a must try!  Love, love, love it!"
1803125200,500090,2014/9/11,0,The ingredients for the Parmesan cheese are different from the amount listed in the instructions
2123645,500090,2014/10/13,4,"Really good recipe! We thought it was a little too salty, so I would recommend cutting back on the ranch mix and using unsalted butter."
2722551,496494,2013/3/11,4,It's wonderful. I'm going to try this one out. Paleo is really something that I would suggest to my friends. I've been on it for 2 weeks now and it couldn't be better.
37449,512533,2014/2/3,5,"Made for super bowl Sunday, this was enjoyed by my son and I. Nice flavors! Thanks for posting. :)"
37449,514006,2014/5/16,5,These were flavorful and I felt healthy eating them! I scaled the recipe down for 2 large burgers and served with  a mustard sauce.Thanks for posting!
2000066421,500090,2015/3/16,3,"Making this tonight, it sounds like an amazing recipe, next time I&#039;ll be more careful to add little parmesan cheese as the recipe and instructions for how much are totally different and it seemed to have gotten muddied up when I mixed it in."
1802992043,500090,2015/6/28,5,I made these and they are delicious! I also used unsalted butter after reading some of the reviews stating that they were salty.
2000612111,500090,2015/10/27,1,Can I just say Wow and not in a good way. This recipe looks simple and delicious but was so bad it wasn&#039;t even edible. I just threw away $11 bucks worth of precious mushrooms. So sad!
1802858202,500090,2016/7/21,3,"I made this last night using baby Bella mushrooms. The mushrooms weren't as appetizing as in the picture, maybe it was the mushrooms. I did find it salty as well. I used 2 Tablespoons of Parmesan cheese as the ingredients indicate, not the 2 teaspoons that the directions say. It was an ok recipe. Not sure if I will make it again."
1712662,500090,2016/8/13,5,"These mushrooms were tasty and delectable. I think as I read the recipe the directions were confusing as to the ranch dressing. A packet of dry ranch dressing is four ounces.. The recipe calls for one ounce and yet still says to add the packet. When you add the ranch, just eyeball about one ounce and the result is perfect."
2000994164,500090,2017/2/18,5,Someone made these at work a couple of years ago and now everyone always asks her to make them. Never found them salty and she even adds a little more parmesan to hers. The butter sauce the mushrooms create is excellent with fresh baguette! YUM
2001489636,500090,2017/4/15,0,Do you use grated Parmesan cheese or shredded ??
1802572298,500090,2017/6/12,5,"First of all, OMG!!!! These were AMAZING!!! (I did make a couple of changes though) Instead of &quot;butter&quot; I used 1 stick of Kerrygold Garlic and Herb Butter (picture included). And, because we love garlic so much, I also smashed 5 or 6 good sized garlic cloves and added them to the mushrooms. I have a small 2qt crockpot which worked out perfect. Seriously, I kept going back until any that were left over were gone!! YES, they are that good!!!"
381722,500090,2018/6/8,5,"I used white button mushrooms, Kroger brand Ranch Dressing Mix (it's in one ounce packets), and real Parmesan, not the kind in a plastic jar. They are delicious. Mild, flavorful and go well with the tenderloin I treat myself to now and then."
10404,522887,2015/7/30,5,I really liked this recipe.  I did add a bit of ground ginger which gave it a bit of zing.  I made this not for salad but for cold noodles to marinate in to put on salad.  Delish!
305531,522887,2015/8/3,5,This was such a super simple dressing that I really enjoyed. It went well on a salad to accompany a Japanese dinner. Thanks for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2.
386585,518245,2014/9/2,5,"This was super easy to make and was very tasty.  I steamed the snow peas and broccoli in the microwave until tender, and there was no need to glance.  I used an orange pepper, since the yellow ones available to me were not very nice.  I used about 1/2 cup red onion, since it is very strong when raw, and I did not want to overpower the salad.  For the rice, I used brown rice.  To make the dressing, I used a combination of fresh coriander (cilantro) and parsley, and also used Worcestershire sauce.  The dressing had a lot of flavor and suited the salad very well.  I will be enjoying this again!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
2001900964,530303,2018/5/28,5,An impressive dessert to serve in pretty cups. The spring strawberries were tart and I needed to add extra fine sugar to sweeten it up. The mint was cut up very small. Next time blueberries will be used. This was fun to make &amp; all were impressed.
1803633519,503564,2015/1/8,5,This recipe was very tasty!  Thanks for posting it.  My next step is to invite family over so they can be impressed with my cooking. ;-)
2000839172,503564,2016/1/27,5,"LOVE! Super easy and very tasty. I know I will be making this periodically from here on out! I had thick cut loin pork chops in my freezer so I used those and cooked for about an hour.  I also used plain bread crumbs, since that is what I had on hand, I added a little bit of garlic salt to them for more flavor."
569512,512810,2014/4/29,5,This dressing is easy to make in a blender and is the right balance of sweet and tangy. My new favorite!
779622,512810,2014/11/16,5,"Very good. Threw everything in my nutribullet, very easy to make. I am new to dr. fuhrman&#039;s recipes. I did not know salad dressing without oil could be so good and easy to make. Thanks for sharing."
2000364689,512810,2015/7/26,5,I have been making this for a while now and my family loves it. I am not a fan of sweet dressing but the balance is nice and goes with any salad. I have put chia seeds in as well which ends up thickening the dressing and adds great nutrition!
2000624727,512810,2015/10/31,5,"Very good recipe, I was amazed by how well it tasted and it&#039;s much better and tastes much healthier than store bought dressings. It&#039;s nice and thick which to my surprise I like. I&#039;m use to those oil filled dressings but this is much  better!!! Definitely try it as it takes no time to make in a blender. I used a Blentec blender."
2001459181,512810,2017/3/27,0,"I bought the balsamic vinigarette from Dr Fuhrman's site, and in a word, I used to be addicted to chocolate; now I'm addicted to Fuhrmans balsamic vinigatrette :-) Am trying to make it at home from the ingredients on the label and looking at the above."
2001488794,512810,2017/4/14,5,"Made this dressing last night to go with an assortment of veggies (kale, green onions, celery, tomato, red pepper, rainbow carrots, cucumber, broccoli, and cilantro) and it was delicious! I had all the ingredients on hand. It was so easy, just threw everything in the Vitamix. You can thin it out to your liking by adding more water. My salad was finger licking good! :) This recipe will last me for 2-3 salads. My friend who smelled this dressing said it smells store bought. Will be making this dressing again."
2001303441,512810,2018/1/4,5,This is the best dressing ever ! You can't even tell there is no oil - great flavor!
2002215669,512810,2018/7/12,0,"just a reminder folks. Walnuts are full of oil, as are all nuts ....but this is a goody nonetheless."
2002251068,512810,2018/8/18,5,Great oil-free dressing. It has tons of flavor and is extremely easy and fast to make. .The only thing I did different was to add some sesame seeds. Can't beat the Vitamix either - love it.
1800200914,512810,2018/10/16,5,"oh my goodness, just made this dressing...amazing!"
2549237,505377,2013/8/13,5,"We really loved this meal.  We served it along mashed potatoes and gravy and fresh green beans for a delicious meal.  My husband needed to throw dinner in the crock pot before work because I was still in the hospital, so he threw this all together and put it on LOW heat for about 10 hours and we shred it up and fixed the side dishes and everything came together quickly.  My husband said this would be great on a toasted roll with pepperjack cheese.  This would be so simple to put in a lunch box for him, if we would have had leftovers.  Made for Express Round 2 during ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers."
2597942,505377,2013/8/15,4,"08/13/13: I made this recipe this afternoon. We are just sitting down to dinner and will post an entire review shortly. Be back soon to update...&lt;br/&gt;Okay... I&#039;m back. I stick by my 4 stars (hubby &amp; I both agreed). The rub was easy enough to make. The ingredients are normal spice &amp; pantry items. What threw me, was the intro stating that &quot;country style pork ribs&quot; were meaty with &quot;bone-in&quot;. In Illinois, they only are sold as &quot;boneless&quot;.    I had a 4lb family pack of &quot;bonless, country style, pork ribs&quot;. My oval crock-pot would only hold 2lbs in a single layer over the onions. (So I&#039;m saving the other 2 lbs for an Asian recipe for ZWT9). I also made the rub as directed, but it was not enough to coat 2 lbs. (I suggest doubling it). It did take 4 hours on high to cook to temp. No distinct flavors shown thru, either (which I guess can be a good thing). Using the leftovers tomorrow for BBQ pulled pork sandwiches. Thank you for a nice &quot;kick-off recipe&quot; to play around with. I will make this again. (Made for ZWT9)&lt;br/&gt;Update 08/14/13: I&#039;m bumping my rating up to 4.5 stars (if that were possible). I used our leftover ribs (only 4 out of 10) to make BBQ pulled pork sandwiches for lunch today. Very yummy. Thanks again for a nice recipe (pic should post shortly, I hope)."
133174,505377,2013/9/3,5,I love crock pot cooking!  The rub ingredients were put into the spice grinder and given a whirl.  I wasn&#039;t sure my coffee was ground fine enough.  In place of the meaty ribs I used a boneless pork sirloin roast.  The meat was rubbed with a portion of the rub mixture then allowed to sit for about 30 minutes and then the remaining rub used.  The meat was placed in the croc kpot along with a large sweet onion and cooked on high for about 4 hours.  The meat was shredded and allowed to cool down to absorb the juices.  I kept out enough for a couple of pulled pork sandwiches tonight for dinner and then froze the rest.  Made for Family Picks ZWT9.
92006,505377,2017/11/22,5,"I made these as directed, except, I added 1/2 cup of beef broth I'm glad I did, because I used the resulting broth to spoon over the meat. It was great with flour tortillas and salsa. One of my kids are it with BBQ sauce and he thought it was good that way too. Made with love for Susie's cook-a-thon."
315565,505668,2013/8/20,5,I tried this as an experiment as I had milk to use up and rice flour left from making Xmas shortbread. It came together fast but needed extra long slow cooking to get rid of the floury chalky texture. You need to stir or whisk non stop because it will catch on the bottom. I used brown sugar not palm sugar and halved the amount and I was &#039;out&#039; of pandanus leaves !!! Next time !!! I got tired of stirring but my daughter took over to get it to a perfect consistency - thick and lustrous. We had no idea of what to expect but I will give 5 stars for an excellent cultural and culinary experience. Made for ZWT9.
157167,505668,2013/8/20,4,"I had the opposite problem of katew - this was delicious but it suddenly went from a flourly liquid to a solid after about 5 minutes of cooking.  It stuck on the bottom and I wasn&#039;t prepared to pull if off and onto a greased baking pan at that moment.  The end result really reminded me of mochi, but with a coconut flavor.   When I make mochi I knead the dough after it cooks, so I may try that with this recipe in the future.  I made a half batch and got 25 little pieces - someone could maybe eat 3-4 pieces, so a full recipe would serve at least 12 people. For ZWT9"
2001644177,532921,2017/7/26,5,"The vegetable cube was wonderful with the quinoa. The cube accented the strawberry, mint, and feta ingredients perfectly. A must try recipe for anyone looking to make a quinoa salad in the near future!!!"
157167,503332,2013/7/30,4,"Wow!  These are like slightly salty doughnuts, but much easier and less messy!  The directions are a bit unclear about how large the bakes should be, I made 1/4 batch, and got 16 palm sized fried bits of goodness, which would easily serve 4 for breakfast.  For ZWT9"
2000797085,503332,2016/1/3,0,This recipe is nowhere near what a St.Lucian fry bake is. We don&#039;t put confectioners sugar on there and the ingredient list is just way off. I am St. Lucian. I know. Modify or change the title.
2001618261,503332,2017/7/8,5,This is what we call &quot;floats&quot; and I lessened the amount of salt as that amount makes it entirely too salty. The sugar adds that extra little something and served with saltfish w. peppers and onions. Not exactly as remembered in Stl but still very good
2399085,506310,2013/9/1,5,"Made  for PRMR! These had a great flavor. I&#039;ve never eaten these so I can&#039;t compare to anything. The only downfall is the amount of calories...Love it, it is a keeper. Thanks"
2597942,506310,2013/9/3,5,"I made these tonight for hubby (since I do not like or ever eat beans). Tonight was an exception. I was on speaker phone with my GF while making them, and she kept telling me to try one... so I did. The next batch, I tried another... and so on... and so on. LOL. Long story short... you have a winner here! I won&#039;t compare them to TGI FRidays, but the coating cooks up perfectly! I did a sacraficial bean and my oil was too hot (no thermometer). Next one I ate needed a tad more salt. I used haricot verts, and it worked out beautifully. I plan to use this coating on a zucchini sitting on my counter. I did add a bit more salt. These were really good (and I do not like or eat beans, but these I really liked). Hubby scarfed most of them down so fast when I would take a batch out, I was lucky to save a few for me to get a picture! Thank you for posting and for converting me into a bean eater.

679953,506310,2014/1/1,5,"Very different, yet flavorful.  Loved the spicy mayo.  We all managed to eat the whole batch.  I did cut the kosher salt in half.  The race was on for seconds.  Loved them.  Made for PRMR Tag"

2000917046,499139,2016/3/13,5,is the shortening a powdered one (like starch) or it can be a veggie shortening in cube?
128473,495334,2013/3/2,3,"I must admit that I was confused by the instructions in this recipe.  I added everything to the BBQ sauce when ready and served it on Hoagie buns and also on Baguette. It was difficult to eat, we had to use a knife and fork. The sauce was delicious the meat a little tough. All said the flavor was nice, a good use of contest ingredients.  Good luck in the contest."

157425,517593,2018/8/10,5,"We drink a lot of tea and this one has been made several times, I used peach tea begs, think they were Celestial Seasonings, and added the peaches, strawberries, and blueberries before serving. Hubby drinks sweet tea so this was just right for him but a little to sweet for me. Either way 5+++ tea! Made and reviewed for Susie D's World Tour."
865936,517401,2014/10/7,5,"Totally fantastic!  Crunchy outside, sweet lemony flavor inside.  The basil butter tastes even better the longer it sits."
169430,493173,2013/9/12,5,I think Boomie hit this one out of the ball park. I used the mozzarella choice and the white sauce was a lovely update from usual red tomato sauce. DH and I each had seconds because it&#039;s just so yummy. All that was needed for a side was a simple salad. This recipe is a keeper!  :D
274666,531145,2018/1/4,2,"Love the ease of this recipe, however it doesn't allow for the bones to be boiled leaving the impurities in the broth. There was a bitter aftertaste either from the bone impurities or from the spices being in the broth for so long."
135470,503168,2013/8/24,5,"This was a saving grace recipe - I had made another sauce that was coconut milk with a few additions, and wasn&#039;t very good, so I strained out the veggies and used this recipe and added the coconut milk so as not to waste it and it saved my dinner!

486725,503168,2014/3/8,5,"Really tasty and very close to what you would be served with fresh rolls in a Vietnamese restaurant. The peanut butter was a nice quick way to add that flavor. I could see this being great over lots of things, especially noodles."
2324285,498789,2013/5/1,5,"We loved this Indian twist on beans and rice.  I could not find a 19oz can of chickpeas, but the 15oz can I got seemed to be more than enough (I was serving it as a side anyway).  The toasted almonds and cilantro add the perfect finish, and the dish tasted great alongside the curries I made.  Thanks for sharing!"
2001123919,535958,2018/8/15,5,My family loves mac and cheese and I am always looking at new and improved ways to make it. This is my family's favorite. Very creamy. Can be made ahead and then baked.
2002347570,535958,2018/11/24,5,"Perfect because you don't have to worry about your sauce breaking!!! I did add some cayenne, garlic powder, mustard powder and Worcestershire sauce but that's personal preference. Great base recipe!"
840768,506754,2013/11/18,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  For a change I didn&#039;t change any ingredients and the flavour turned out great.  I changed up the cooking order though; onions first, then peppers. Great recipe, thanks for sharing."
2001906857,506754,2018/1/2,5,"This is a great recipe and unbelievably delicious. Due to cholesterol, I omitted the bacon and used light olive oil in its place. This will be the only way I make cabbage from here on out!"
239758,516353,2018/9/4,5,"What a great recipe. I made this with two rather large (and thick) chicken breasts, so cooked the sliced cutlets for 3 minutes each side at the start. Used the full amounts of mushrooms and onions because we love them. As an aside, we can't get frozen pearl onions in Australia, so I used very small eschallots from a neighbour's garden, which took ages to peel but were well worth it. I finished off a bottle of brandy for this recipe, so had just under 1/2 cup, but that was fine. Goes to show you how a recipe like this can be flexible. After I took the photo and put the camera away, I realised I hadn't yet added the thyme. I love this herb and it's a perfect addition. Served over a mixture of brown and white rice, and with steamed broccoli and roasted brussels sprouts. Thanks so much for posting."
2324285,500124,2013/9/3,5,"Delicious- one of the best moles that I&#039;ve made.  Rich and chocolately, but not sweet.  I love the addition of pepitas, and I even toasted some extra for garnishing the bowls.  Served over black bean-coconut rice for a great meal."
1586203,499334,2013/7/22,4,This recipe is really simple and fast to put together. I will definitely make this again for my family.
957657,499334,2013/10/14,5,"WOW!  This is one of the best &quot;internet finds&quot; I have ever found.  They are delicious &amp; well worth making over &amp; over again.  I did have to bake these for 23 minutes.  Just watch when you are buying the cookie dough that you DON&#039;T buy the pkg for the large cookies or you&#039;ll have to split the squares.  And DO buy regular sized Reese&#039;s peanut butter cups, not the mini&#039;s.  Eating them while they are still warm is just sinfully delightful!  Worth all 5 stars!"
1800345675,499334,2013/11/27,0,"Absolutely delicious!  Easy to make but the time is way off, mine took 25 minutes!"
2610728,499334,2014/2/15,5,"I&#039;ve made these before and they&#039;ve been a big hit (of course, I make my own cookie dough and brownie mix--I don&#039;t like packaged things).  Tomorrow I&#039;m going to make them again, but I&#039;m going to try making them with Rolos in the middle.  Mmmm....caramel!"
2000109135,499334,2015/4/2,5,What is a good name to call this?
239758,523275,2018/8/28,5,"I had to make this recipe. For starters, my maiden name is Austin. Plus, earlier this year, I bought a bottle of Aperol, even though I'd never tasted it until tonight. I like things on the sour/bitter side and this drink is perfect in every way. I even like the colour. But be careful. The drink goes down rather easily and it would be easy to overdo it. I limited myself to one."
2710128,495905,2013/2/24,0,"Came out great! Used homemade potatoes, forgot Simply Potatoes & it's snowing to bad to go out. family loved it & so much easier than when I make peirogies"
2002104217,534786,2018/4/11,5,"Tried this last night and it was very good. Was better today after sitting in the fridge all night actually. Would definitely make again, but next time would probably put a little less cumin."
2000669543,522984,2018/6/29,5,"I made this tonight and it was fantastic! I did add 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, but even without them this cake would be lovely. Turned out light and fluffy. I will definitely be making this again."
526666,504327,2013/8/26,5,"Mikekey, these things are soooo dern good! I had egg roll wrappers, so I cut them down the middle and kinda made little envelopes out of the banana encased wrapper. After they were cooked, the vanilla sugar turns to syrup and these things are TDF! I over indulged, but wouldn&#039;t give up a BITE! Thanks for this tasty treat, Mikekey! :D"
2002248034,522854,2018/8/14,5,Saw others but this one hit the nail on the head about swirling the chamoy around the cup great idea we pay $2.99 same size didn't realize it was that easy...delicious
1938536,503165,2013/7/6,5,"Full of flavor and easy!  I did have to dilute the marinade for my 90 year old dad.  He thought it was too spicy when he tasted it. So, I started over and just used a 1/8 tsp of the cayenne (or less) and added honey and a couple of tablespoons of melted butter to further cut the heat.  I marinated the thighs all day, baked them about 50 minutes, and yummy they were so flavorful.  I served the thighs with these condiments: sliced green olives, raisins (plumped in hot water), toasted slivered almonds, parsley, and lemon zest.  I also served lemon wedges to squeeze too.  My sides were whole wheat couscous, sauteed kale, corn on the cob, and a green salad.  Everyone in the family including my dad gave this a five star rating!  PS: For those of us who like spicy, I put cayenne on the table to add as desired!  I will be making this again!"
169430,503165,2013/10/5,5,"There is a wonderful amount of great flavor here. I made one change, I replaced the wine with chicken broth which worked well for me. The chicken was tender, moist and delicious. I served it with lemon saffron rice and cumin roasted carrots for a company worthy dinner. Made for NA/ME forum&#039;s Visit To Tunisia 10/13. Thanks Mike :D"
1271506,503165,2015/8/9,5,"This was very good, but much better reheated.  I&#039;m not sure whether it&#039;s a question of my needing to marinade it longer (mine had about 4 hours) or what.  But it definitely improved the second day.  Served it with a vinegar-based cabbage slaw and whole-wheat couscous."
67728,501781,2014/4/17,5,"Whoo, these are boozy little suckers! Delicious, but no denying the rum in these, that&#039;s for sure! I used Malibu Coconut rum and Scharffen-Berger bittersweet squares. I thought at first that maybe I should double the recipe, because it doesn&#039;t look like it makes very much. In hindsight, I&#039;m glad that I didn&#039;t, because small doses satisfy here. These would make a nice Valentine&#039;s day gift, wrapped up in some pretty packaging. DH has commandeered the bulk of the first batch I made, but I think I&#039;ll make another batch for Dad, cuz I suspect he&#039;d like them just as much as DH did. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
314579,517565,2014/8/14,4,"Good cocktail.  I measured it exactly as written and it came out featuring the bourbon, and wasn&#039;t too sweet.  Will certainly make again!  Thanks for the cocktail momaphet!"
1596972,520435,2015/1/13,5,"Seriously the best tasting mac and cheese sauce!! And it&#039;s vegan!! No one would believe it.   I was about to make my standard vegan mac and cheese sauce from another recipe that I&#039;ve been using for two years and thought I would go looking for something else to try.  I&#039;m so glad I did.   Other vegan recipes, including the one I had been using, are named mac and cheese, but taste nothing like it.  I couldn&#039;t believe it when I tried this one.  I made my cheese loving husband try it and he was amazed.  Our daughter can&#039;t eat dairy and this sauce is the answer to so many things we like to make but couldn&#039;t.  Add some diced tomatoes and green chilies to this and it could be queso!  Use agar and it could be cheese slices for a sandwich.  Sunrabbit, what you have done here is amazing!  Thank you so much!  I&#039;ll be making your other recipes for sure.  Keep posting!"
2689184,494959,2013/2/11,5,The elotes salad was delicious!  It was perfect with the grilled shrimp.
2694684,494959,2013/2/15,5,"Yummy,zesty and easy to prepare. My family loves this food combination."
1803655051,520322,2015/1/13,5,My almost 12 year old daughter made this for us tonight.  Granted she has a lot of experience cooking but this was easy enough for her to make.  This was one of the best lasagna&#039;s I&#039;ve ever had - highly recommend!
865936,501656,2013/9/16,5,These were simply fantastic!  Very well balanced.
266635,501656,2014/5/19,5,"These delicious tacos made a great lunch alongside some mango/avocado guacamole.  I love radishes -- they are wonderful detoxifiers for the body (among other great health benefits) and this radish salsa was a such a surprising addition to these tacos.  Loved the combination of the corn and black beans with the feta as well.  Will definitely make these wonderful tacos again.  Made for PRMR, May, 2014."
2000431901,501656,2017/3/16,5,These were amazing!!!
2001457336,501656,2017/4/12,4,
2000846690,501656,2018/4/25,5,Made the black bean with radish salas !It was the best!!!thank you!!! My husband just loved it so much!!!!!thank you again!!!!
2001200936,501656,2018/5/14,0,This is delicious they did need a little more heat so I added some homemade green sauce yum will be making this again and again
2001259816,501656,2018/5/17,5,"Wow! This was fantastic! The small can of corn was 11oz and I used a jalape&ntilde;o pepper, queso fresco, and omitted extra salt (plenty in canned vegs &amp; cheese) but otherwise kept to the recipe. Add a slice of fresh avocado on top! Your vegan relations/friends can omit the cheese and it's still a great meal."
198154,501656,2018/6/5,5,"We are not typically fans of radishes. But there was a bag of them in our farm share and I didn't want to waste them. My can of corn was bigger than called for, but I threw the whole thing in anyway and I always double my garlic in recipes. I used a jalape&ntilde;o pepper, and my feta was reduced fat, but it turned out fabulous. I'll admit, we weren't expecting to like these and instead we all went back for seconds! It's not often our entire family agrees on something, so a five star rating from this crew is a true complement!"
679953,509634,2014/4/18,4,The marinade was very good... though I had a bit of trouble with the batter with the onion sticking to the chicken..  Overall a good recipe.
1803516906,499574,2014/12/17,0,"Question: I made this cake last night and it was horribly flat. Didn&#039;t rise at all. The directions don&#039;t mention it, but are you supposed to include the ingredients called for on the cake mix box as well?"
2868965,499574,2014/12/20,0,"Read MF&#039;s review. I haven&#039;t made this recipe but I would guess that you are NOT meant to add the ingredients on the box unless they include anything beyond what this recipe calls for. Eggs and fat are standard ingredients on cake mix boxes and you wouldn&#039;t want to double them, I shouldn&#039;t think. Hope this helps if you want to try. It&#039;s an easy mistake to make, so don&#039;t feel bad."
2364755,507027,2014/11/26,5,easy and fantastic! I don&#039;t know if i&#039;ll ever buy canned again! The only thing I did differently was I didn&#039;t use a microwave. Thank you so much for helping me make my Thanksgiving gluten free! Happy Thanksgiving!
2000251958,507027,2015/11/15,5,Some of my favorite recipies call for condensed C.O.M. soup. It has been one of the hardest things about finding out I have celiacs! This is amazing. Thank you for giving me back all my childhood favorites!
2001261950,507027,2016/11/22,3,whoops! do be careful-checked the label and found my onion powder contains wheat. got around it by grating in a fresh onion. should do the trick
2001263851,507027,2016/11/23,5,"I used butter in place of the oil, delicious!"
2001288294,507027,2016/12/8,4,"I could have done without the sugar, but otherwise this is the closest GF version to Campbell's I could find. This and Aldi's GF French fried onions mean that I can have green bean casserole again!"
2001820414,507027,2017/11/23,0,Oh my gosh this is delicious! So much better than canned soup with flour in it!
2001820251,534001,2017/12/11,0,"I simply love the creative, fun way, to celebrate the holiday. I can't wait to make one for my Christmas party. Pictures will follow when I finish making it."
2001858309,534001,2017/12/18,0,Video won't work so I'm trying to figure out how you do the base?
2001866714,507027,2017/12/23,5,"Just made this with these tweaks: - whole evaporated milk - a little more than &frac12; tsp. onion - no sugar - everything else the same Using it in my GF dried beef casserole. The texture was great and it smelled/tasted divine. THANK YOU for a wonderful, inexpensive recipe; I will be using it forever!!"
1458727,516712,2014/6/14,5,"Well, I think your method is brilliant.  We are retired and I find my best time, energy wise is in the morning. So any prep work, dicing onions, carrots, celery, or seasoning is done as early as possible.  So this gets my 5 stars.  Thank You for posting."
2001288026,512014,2016/12/13,5,best recipe for meatballs
47892,507478,2014/1/28,4,"We like this very much but there was something missing and five minutes into eating our sweet potato with chimichurri bowls it hit me: raw onion. So, I quickly diced red onion and garnished the mixture with them. I experimented with quinoa&#039;s cousin called &#039; ka~niwa/canahua&#039; and to bulk up this recipe (was served as a main dish) we added fresh greens. Fresh cilantro replaced some of the fresh parsley. Made for Veggie Swap January."
542159,497916,2013/9/1,5,Yes GRPA this is the BEST and you are a 100% correct this needs real butter. We love this and now I know my grandmothers secret she used real butter (mom always used margarine and it was never the same). Thanks for the great post.
364211,497916,2013/9/3,5,"Excellent!  As  a young child learned on my own to create this wonderful treat. I added a good pat of real butter, hand made by my grandmother from her &quot;milk cow&quot;,  to a ? couple of ounces of honey, or sometimes sorghum syrup, taking my fork to the pat of butter and mashing on one side, then the other then stirring and incorporating it until it resembled a creamy dreamy concoction that was just this side of heaven good.  Thanks GRPA for the memories your recipe conjured up!  Will have to revisit this soon, its been a long time."
169430,497916,2013/11/25,5,"Perfectly lovely honey butter. I sampled it on this mornings raisin toast, yummy. It&#039;s a classic, so smooth, creamy and delicious. I&#039;ll be using more of it tonight in mashed carrots and I know that it will marvelous."
2597942,497916,2013/11/26,5,"Well, we have another winner here. This is such a simple and delicious butter to keep on hand. I originally made it to try on Recipe #503887, but found that the combination was just a bit too sweet for me. I think this would be lovely with plain rolls, toast or even on a stack of pancakes. I will definitely make this again, but to use elsewhere. I normally keep margarine in the fridge for pan frying and misc... but I did use real butter for this (and I only use real butter when I think a recipe deserves it). This recipe definitely deserves the little extra cost of using real butter. I can&#039;t wait to use it again. Super simple (2 ingredients)... I can&#039;t believe I never thought of doing this. Thank you for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
724631,497916,2013/12/16,5,"Simply wonderful!  I used Land O&#039; Lakes butter instead of the less expensive (and more watery) no-name brand.  (America&#039;s Test Kitchen Cooking School Cookbook says the no-names have the minimum amount of butter fat, but said L.O.L. was quite good so there was no need to pay exorbitant prices for &quot;gourmet&quot; butter.)  I used regular clover honey, but will use orange-blossom honey next time.  I whipped this in my stand mixer.  It was soft enough that I should have pulled out a pastry bag with star tip or a spritz cookie press to make fancy individual butter servings (chilled in the freezer) for a holiday dinner.  Guess I&#039;ll have to make some more...  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
2001686097,505267,2017/8/26,5,"I made this cake yesterday and my family loved it! I added zucchini last as it wasn't in the written instructions and I overlooked it ??... I was a little worried but it turned out wonderfully. I didn't have cinnamon candies so I substituted raisins and added a little more cinnamon. Today I'm making it to bring to a party and hope to get a photo before it's gone! I will bake it at the same temperature but perhaps for a little less time, my oven may run hot. I frosted with a cream cheese frosting. Thank you for this great recipe."
367392,513298,2015/7/16,5,One Word =  DELICIOUS!  Thank you for posting  :)
482376,532442,2017/8/29,4,These were fun to make. I liked the muffin tin technique! The dough was easy to work with and form. The filling was tasty. My family liked but didn't love the empanadas - which could be personal tastes. They sure are pretty and they were fun to make. I liked them very much. Thank you!
895132,532442,2017/9/2,5,"The filling is excellent! To make a gluten free crust, I used 1 cup fine yellow cornmeal, 1/2 cup white rice flour and 1/2 cup tapioca starch plus 1/2 tsp. xanthan gum and 1/2 tsp. salt, 3 tbsp. coconut oil, 1 egg and 1/2 cup ice cold water. The crust is not terrific, texture wise, no gluten free pie crust hero here, but with the filling it was fantastic! Thanks for sharing! Made this for CQ 2017 Central America for the Empanadas VS Pupusas Challenge for the Happy Campers"
2001303066,530305,2017/2/27,5,"I love onion rings, but when they are made in the fryer, they tend to be to greasy. These were not like that at all, I really enjoyed them without feeling sick afterwards."
114027,504320,2013/8/26,5,"Yum! Drank this for breakfast one morning and really enjoyed it! (but don&#039;t forget the sugar like I did on my first try)The nuts give this a little bit of a heartier texture and feel, I really enjoyed that. Made for the Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT9."
1801697824,527368,2016/7/4,5,I had already worked out how I am making my trifle for the 4th of July but this recipe is fabulous and I will be trying it next year minus the blueberries next year (I don't like blueberries). I really love the idea of pop rocks and I ideas of many different holiday &amp; special occasion applications. Thanks for the recipe and great ideas.
286566,497360,2013/10/9,5,"We really enjoyed this meatloaf, though it wasn&#039;t till I put it in the oven that I realized I had not cooked the bacon but it still worked out well cooking at 175C fan forced and the bacon cooked up nicely, thank you ElizabethKnicely, made for Photo Tag tag game."
482376,510240,2014/4/29,5,Healthy and delicious! The rub provides a nice and different flavor for the salmon. I especially liked the spinach and roasted onions. I ended up mixing it all together. Yum. Made for the 2014 Spring Pick A Chef event in the contests and events forum. Thank you!
870705,502061,2013/10/29,4,"I love enchiritos so I was anxious to try this recipe.  I made the following changes to the original recipe:  I used 4 legs and 4 thighs instead of breasts and wasn&#039;t able to find Mexican tomato sauce so I used regular tomato sauce and added a 1/2 tsp. of chili powder to the sauce.  I also bought the wrong size tortillas....mine were about 7-inches instead of 10 but they worked out fine.  I liked the recipe basically but felt that the sauce was a little strong.  I had sauce left over, that might have been because of using the smaller tortillas.  I think it might be better to leave out the tomato sauce and perhaps   to  let the sauce simmer for 20-30 minutes for the flavors to blend.  Thanks for posting!  Made for My 3 Chefs 2013."
1803139366,502061,2014/9/29,5,"DEEEEE-LICIOUS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used Cheddar-Jack on the top, and Ro-tel tomatoes instead of stewed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dish that the entire family loves (including our anti-spicy 2 year old), even as leftovers!"
284897,501494,2013/8/5,5,"I had to use frozen cranberries, as we very rarely find fresh cranberries here.&lt;br/&gt;Everything else was as per the recipe.... and wow, we loved this. Just a hint of sweetness from the orange with wonderful spicy flavours from the ginger and cinnamon it was just perfect to go with our chicken last night for dinner. This was 5 stars and more!&lt;br/&gt;I am making this for Christmas, I just loved it!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks lazyme."
2887412,493614,2013/7/3,0,Thanks for the receipt.! Just bake some and totally love the smell of it... can&#039;t wait to sink my teeth into them.
2001431887,530611,2017/3/12,5,This was a wonderful dish and the directions were easy to follow. Thank you
107135,513721,2014/9/17,5,very nice i used crushed ginger from the jar lol cakepops on parade
50509,513721,2014/9/18,0,"I&#039;ve done something similar for many years - learned at a Chinese cooking class. I do this with pretty much any kind of fish, and don&#039;t bother with the hot oil at the end, but sprinkle the scallions on the fish at the beggining. I also usually mince or julienned the ginger.  Instead of messing around with the chopsticks, invest in a bamboo steamer basket. They are inexpensive and available at Asian markets, as well as places like Cost Plus. You just plop the food in the basket, cover with the basket top, and place on top of the steaming wok. Very easy, and the steaming bamboo adds its own scent to the proceedings."
2001590187,530611,2017/6/18,5,This was absolutely phenomenal. What I like best is they were made ahead and heated just before I served them. They look like I went through a lot of work but they are real easy to make and really good.
2664088,494250,2013/1/28,4,"Made after work for family of six. Pretty easy.I thickened the sauce and mixed with the noodles, it works better with kids. Turned out great!"
577388,492736,2014/8/4,5,"Very  excellent, thanks for posting. Next time I&#039;ll skimp on the Worsteshire, but a great recipe. Will make again."
2000333387,516142,2015/7/12,1,This turned out horribly. The batter was the consistency of bread dough (or just about) so I ended up mixing in about another 1/4 cup of milk. My family all said it tasted like raw dough. We ended up tossing everything and pulling out a box of hungry jack and adding in white chocolate and raspberries or blueberries. My suggestion is to find your own favorite home made pancake mix recipe and just add in what you want. I can&#039;t believe this recipe is even on here.
1540041,500592,2013/8/26,5,Amazing! The bread under the chicken was to die for!  All the flavors came together. Only change we made was we buttered the underside of the skin. We took Dorie&#039;s advice and reted the chicken great side standing in a bowl. Enjoy:))
526666,503945,2013/7/27,5,"So daggone good! I only made 1/2 the recipe (10 pastries) and was immediately remorseful that they will be gone, quickly! YUM! They do take a little while to get going and you have to be careful with your phyllo, but all the work is it&#039;s own reward, after the first bite! I really like the honey cinnamon syrup; that was like the cherry on top! Delicious! Thanks so much for sharing, momaphet!"
1629974,495017,2013/4/16,0,"I have made these many times since I first saw them on the Chew. They are very moist, tender and tasty. This recipe replaced my old favorite- one that I had used for over 30 years!  I&#039;m grateful that you posted the recipe- the Chew website is very slow and not that easy to navigate. Thanks again, Dayle"
205750,501779,2014/5/8,5,Yum! These little cakes were sweet silky and delicious - and they were so easy to make. The flour in the mix forms a light crust at the base and the centres are lovely and &quot;custardy&quot;. We loved them - made for spring PAC 2014
386585,503334,2013/8/20,5,"This was a wonderfully delicious marinade that flavored the steak perfectly.  I made this exactly as posted, except I used one 2-1/2 pound flank steak.  I marinated the meat for 24 hours, and it was infused with all those wonderful flavors.  Made for ZWT 9 by a Tasty Tester."
865936,503334,2013/8/24,4,I used this delicious marinade on beef short ribs cut flanken style.
305531,503334,2013/8/25,5,"This was simple and good. I marinated the steak overnight and ended up grilling it too long, but it was still good. Thanks diner for sharing. Made for ZWT9."
227978,503334,2013/8/27,5,"Excellent, diner524.   The marinade was perfect with our flank steak, and it broiled so nicely and had plenty of flavor.  )Our summer weather took a break today and brought a little rain shower, so I chose to broil instead of grill.  But that was the only change I made to this recipe.)  Made for ZWT #9 (North Africa)."
2002228842,515824,2018/7/24,2,Putting them on the 4 inch rack toasted the outside too fast and were still doughy in the middle had to break them open and cook them for 2-3 more minutes to make sure they were done but will try again but going to use the 1 inch rack instead
2667703,494685,2013/2/25,5,I would try any recipe Eileen comes up with!  This sounds so fresh and tasty - lots of flavor without being too heavy.  My husband and I would love this recipe.  Sounds like a winner!
482376,503842,2013/9/5,4,"This was a nice combination.  I liked the slight peanut butter taste with the rice noodles. I also liked that the green beans were cooked along with the chicken in the slow cooker. The sauce was pretty thin, so next time I think I would try to thicken it before mixing in the noodles. Made for Family Picks during ZWT9 for the Soup-A-Stars"
383346,506305,2013/9/20,4,The taste of this bread is so good.  My son liked it a lot.  I omitted the pecans so he can bring for his snack at school.  The bread didn&#039;t rise a lot.  And I was wondering if maybe baking powder would help.  Thanks Lynette :)  Made for Photo tag game
482376,517956,2014/8/26,5,"Wow, what a recipe! Everything blends together perfectly and makes for a really tasty rice and bean dish. I love how many veggies are in it! This made a huge amount, but I sure will enjoy the leftovers. Next time, I might try omitting the bacon (I can&#039;t believe I just said that) and halving. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks! Made for Culinary Quest - South America - by International Agents of Quest."
131126,495237,2013/2/25,5,"I kept it simple to use the frozen cob corn on hand and the oven method.  The dressing, cheese, and chili powder were new additions to corn for us, but enjoyed.  This would be fun and a special treat at a cookout. I've saved the recipe for summer so I can try it the ""right"" way.  Thank you for the detailed instructions and varieties offered!"
239758,495237,2013/4/14,5,"Wow, love this creation. This is the first time I ever boiled and then grilled corn, and it worked beautifully. The sauce is excellent and was a good reason for me to dip into my small but cherished collection of Hidden Valley dressing mixes (we can&#039;t buy them in Australia). I didn&#039;t have fresh chives, but dried worked just fine. Thanks Rosie for true keeper. I have four more ears of corn, so maybe tomorrow."
37449,495237,2013/6/3,5,I made the esquites version using mayo. Delish. I was yumming my way all the way through! I used 2 ears of corn. Thanks!
266635,495237,2013/9/6,5,"Great corn recipe -- I used the oven method and it was delish.  Love the Hidden Valley Ranch idea -- it really adds great flavor to dishes.  I think you have a winner here!  Made for PRMR, September, 2013."
2324285,495237,2013/12/5,5,"A very cool twist on such a staple Mexican street food!  I liked this more than the &quot;traditional&quot; elote/esquites that I&#039;ve had as it tastes far lighter and the ranch dressing powder was a nice touch.  I went with the esquites directions, and used Cotija cheese instead of Parmesan and limes instead of lemons."
1803072060,518176,2014/8/25,5,Yum!
1803081273,518176,2014/8/28,5,Exceptional!  New great way to use the ingredients!!
400708,496173,2015/11/1,4,"Actually quite easy and fun for a Halloween Dinner, The filling was more than needed for the calzone, but tasted great.  My dough turned out a little tough but that could be because I over handled it.  All in all a fun and tasty treat that everyone enjoyed"

227978,503642,2013/7/15,5,"This was a wonderful beverage to enjoy on a hot day.  Just enough of a creamy touch and plenty of coffee flavor.  It really does needs to be blended though, because otherwise the honey will just thicken against the frozen crushed ice and not flavor the drink well.  But once blended, the flavors meld well together to create a wonderful iced coffee drink.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, loof.  Made for ZWT #9 (Greece)."
169430,503642,2013/7/15,5,"Delish. Thanks much for the coffee my friend. This was lovely on this bright warm morning. It&#039;s lightly sweet, creamy and of so good. Loved every drop and will be enjoying this again soon. :D"
1179225,503642,2013/7/16,5,"Delicious iced coffee recipe! I&#039;ve never tried honey in my coffee before, so this was very new to me. Tasted great. I blended it for a couple minutes to get it nice and frothy. Not too sweet and very refreshing. Thanks for posting the recipe."
228458,503642,2013/7/16,5,"This recipe couldn&#039;t have entered my life on a better day! It is meltingly hot outside and my kiddos were begging for a trip to the park, so I threw this together quickly in my individual sized blender and we hit the road. It was so cool and refreshing for a hot morning at the park :). I reduced the honey a bit because I don&#039;t like my coffee too sweet, but otherwise kept the recipe as is. Thanks, loof! Made for ZWT 9, for the Gourmet Goddesses."
128473,503642,2013/7/17,5,"This was a delicious iced coffee loof.  I really enjoyed the flavor of this treat, it had a really nice balance.  It was quick and really easy to make.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will enjoy often.  Made for ZWT9.    Update: Today, its so hot here that I was feeling lazy, so I threw all the ingredients into the blender and enjoyed this lovely coffee as a slushy.  Wanted you to know that it was wonderful.  Thanks again :lol:"
80353,503642,2013/7/18,4,"Iced coffee is called a &#039;frappe&#039; here (there should be an accent on the &#039;e&#039;, but my keyboard won&#039;t do it!LOL).  I think a very lightly-flavoured honey is more appropriate to allow the coffee to star.  I used greek thyme honey, which did overpower the drink.  I do love my iced coffee in summer, and I appreciated the little &#039;trick&#039; of using honey instead of sugar."
37449,503642,2013/7/18,5,I used hazelnut decaf coffee and soy milk and thoroughly enjoyed this on a hot July afternoon! Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT#9 by team Hot Stuff!
133174,503642,2013/7/18,5,The temperature was over 90 today and having left over coffee from breakfast this was a cooling way to use it.  I made a double batch using almond milk and eyeballing the honey.  The ingredients were placed in the Vita-Mix with a generous amount of ice cubes and given a whirl.  The result was a Starbucks quality iced coffee without the price or the guilt.  Made for ZWT9.
1706426,503642,2013/7/19,5,"Oh, how I needed this today! !00 degrees here. Very good, easily could be sold at Starbucks! Made for ZWT9"
114027,503642,2013/7/19,5,This is a great way for me to drink the leftover coffee my DH leaves me in the mornings :) The honey dissolves better than sugar and adds a nicer flavor. I really enjoyed this today and will be making it alot more often!
1745502,503642,2013/7/22,5,"The honey is a great idea. Mixes easily into already cold coffee and changes up the taste just right. I made this vegan for ZWT9 and was not happy with the results. I used agave syrup, which I felt didn&#039;t add enough flavor, and almond milk. The almond milk was so thin, that if I was making it agiain I would just replace all the water used in making the coffee with almond milk."
220348,503642,2013/7/22,5,"I really liked the idea of adding honey to the ice coffee. I never had it this sweet so it was a real change for me, but it made the coffee lighter, as I&#039;vr always found iced coffee too heavy when it is strong."
1925885,503642,2013/7/24,5,"Gotta say I&#039;m a bit surprised by this!  It&#039;s such a simple little recipe, but it&#039;s sooooo good!  I just threw all the ingredients into the magic bullet for a few seconds until it turned slushy. Sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top. Yum!  The foam separated from the coffee in the pics, but it was still a nice looking drink!  The honey is very subtle but enough to make a difference.  Delish!"
219942,503642,2013/8/26,5,"I have to admit, I drank the first cup warm after tasting it this morning. It was just so cozy-tasting that I couldn&#039;t resist drinking it. Then this afternoon I made it the right way with ice. I like it equally both ways! I mixed the honey into the strong, hot coffee after brewing to ensure it would mix in all the way. Then I added mostly fat free half-and-half instead of all milk, because my milk is only 1%.  (Just a personal preference.) It is creamy and not so awfully sweet, and very comforting! I will make this often. Thanks loof, for a keeper recipe!  ZWT9"
895132,503642,2013/9/6,5,I&#039;m with the other reviewers - I was very surprised at how good this simple recipe is! In fact it was fantastic.

461834,503642,2014/1/11,5,"Great iced coffee!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe and used part 1% milk and part 1/2 and 1/2.  When I went to pour my 1st cup of coffee, I poured 1/4 cup and put it in the refrigerator til this afternoon.  I then but all the ingredients, used extra ice, into my mini ninja mixer and it turned out more like a Starbucks Frappuccino.  The only problem I had was that the honey didn&#039;t mix in well and ended up in the bottom of my cup.  Next time, I would mix the honey in with the hot coffee in the morning and then put it in the fridge.  Thanks for sharing the recipe loof!!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."

169430,517641,2014/8/12,5,"Oh my gosh, this is good. It made a perfect cool down dessert tonight after a meal of a delicious hot soup. I&#039;m surprised that I&#039;m the first to review this with so many coffee lovers around. The ice cream maker produced a perfectly smooth and almost heavenly sorbet that I&#039;ll most certainly make again. :D"
1800199313,500243,2014/1/14,0,"This was really good, however I would use only 2 cans of refrigerated biscuits. 3 was way too much and too much longer to bake."
220348,501184,2013/6/21,4,"I was unsure of the mix between the chicken and the allspice berries and nutmeg. It was not bad, and alot better than I thought it would be. The peach salsa was amazing, and just the right kind of salsa for this kind of chicken."
58104,501184,2013/6/21,5,"I cut the recipe in half using 2 breasts. Marinaded overnight. I loved everything about this recipe except the cooking method of choice, Jerk should be grilled and that is what I did. Oiling the hot grill grates and cooked 4 - 5 minutes per side. Let rest 5 minutes. Even my DH didn&#039;t complain about the cinnamon and nutmeg. Maybe because my jalapeno was nice and hot.  I did use parsley in the salsa for DH would have nothing to do with cilantro. I did add cilantro to mine at serving I must say one breast is a bit much for one person. Yes I did eat the whole thing!  But I regretted it after. So very filling. As for the peaches I didn&#039;t towel dry them and didn`t see any reason for it. I did wonder why not any heat in the salsa but the chicken produced enough heat which making it all good and ymmy. Loved the intro!"
128473,501184,2013/6/21,5,"We really enjoyed this hot and spicy dish.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The salsa was out of this world, it was just wonderful with the chicken, a perfect balance.  I served the chicken and salsa with coconut rice and homemade creamed corn for a wonderful meal.  Great use of contest ingredients...Good Luck in the Contest."
2734669,501184,2013/6/22,3,"This was very different. My wife and I did not care for it so much. This is not the way jerk chicken should taste. I&#039;m sure with the ingredients you had to use that it is okay, but we probably will not make this again. (Just a note, your information at the beginning is quite confusing)."
226863,501184,2013/6/23,5,"I grilled my chicken because it was just too hot to get the oven going in the house!  Plus, I prefer my chicken on the grill.  I used 3 jalapenos because I definitely wanted some heat.  I also used fresh peaches that were nice and ripe instead of the canned ones, and loved the salsa!  Can&#039;t wait to try it with fish sometime.  Thanks for sharing!"
67728,510759,2014/4/17,5,"I really enjoyed this soup! I actually hogged the whole batch of it to bring to work for a week&#039;s worth of dinners, lol! I used packaged chicken stock, all the recommended herbs and spices, one large can of diced tomatoes, one can of Homestyle Veg-all (along with some fresh chopped carrots and celery), and one small can of baby potatoes (clearing out some pantry space). I probably added about 12 cups of stock, and I added a big scoop of some leftover cooked Mexican rice. If I didn&#039;t have the rice in the fridge, I probably would&#039;ve went with orzo, but oh well. Very yummy, and so versatile too! Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
2324285,501184,2013/7/9,4,"I&#039;ve never had jerk chicken before, so I didn&#039;t know what to expect with this recipe.  The peach salsa sounded delicious though, and it was indeed.  The rub on the chicken tasted quite bitter to me though, but everyone else loved it (and they said the bitterness is characteristic of jerk chicken anyway).  I guess jerk chicken is just not for me!  The peach salsa and coconut rice helped quite a bit in toning down the bitterness at least.  [Made &amp; Reviewed for PRMR]"

Well, I made as directed and added carrot, celery and some kale. It all came out quite nice and the oatmeal is very similar to adding barley flakes to a soup. I love the low calorie and sugar content. You could add pretty much anything your heart might desire and it would work here."

1803258263,519099,2014/10/23,4,"OK - I was wary because of the pumpkin. I HATE pumpkin pie along with maybe a handful of other food items. My girlfriend who decided to turn pescatarian later in life made this for me. Biting into this, I was not convinced it would be good, and was determined to prove myself right. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was wrong, it was truly delicious. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The risotto was flavourful and the combination of pumpkin, cheese, and other ingredients gave a slightly savoury taste. The only truly defining quality of the pumpkin was the color.  It was not sweet at all - which seeing as I associated this with pumpkin pie thought it would be if even ever so slightly - I don&#039;t know why - and I get it doesn&#039;t make sense (you live you learn). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All in all it was not the best risotto I had ever tasted, but was certainly not far behind. I bet that if you do try this, you will like it. My only suggestion, don&#039;t tell people what&#039;s in it until after they try it :) I think you could easily replace the canned pumpkin with fresh pumpkin or squash roasted first in the oven to cut back on the sodium and other preservatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, very impressed and would eat again."

I adapted the recipe to prepare in a crockpot, but those  were technique rather than ingredients; however I did omit the beef.  Even without the beef the soup is satisfying.  This was a well flavored, broth based soup.  The soup is spicy without being too hot for average diners.  I would make it again. Good luck!"
679953,495308,2013/3/4,5,"Very satifying, comforting soup.  I used some mild chili sauce in this, and other than that made this as written.

Unsure of what kind of chili sauce to use, I opted for half sweet & hot chili sauce and half sriracha hot sauce, they were wonderful in the dish, complimenting it not over powering at all.

I also added 2 slivered onions, and a handful of raisins, so I doubled the spices/oil to coat all the extra goodies - super delicious, and a really simple meal.  I really like the idea of serving it over couscous (or quinoa for a wheat free option,) since the chicken released a lot of juices that mixed with the spices and onion to make a flavorful sauce.

It also held together really well. Great use for the big tomatoes from my garden. Thanks for posting this recipe!"
1803503726,519587,2014/12/15,0,"I&#039;m going to try this recipe today.  However, I&#039;ll be using Splenda as sugar alcohols do not agree with me.  I&#039;ll use pumpkin pie spice and some vanilla in the egg white mixture.  I&#039;ll let everyone know how they turn out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made these nuts however, I changed the recipe around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the egg white I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  I used Splenda instead of the sugar alcohol.  I also used pumpkin pie spice in place of all the spices called for.  I used walnuts, almonds and peanuts for the nut mixture.  I had company tonight and they all raved about the spiced nuts and asked for the recipe.  So, this one is a keeper!"
267527,504736,2013/7/28,5,"Really good, healthy, and quick to make. I adapted it a little and loved it. Thanks for posting - I&#039;ll use this one alot. Jan."
895132,504736,2013/8/23,5,"Awesome salad! Followed the recipe to the letter, using the red pepper flakes option, and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing :)&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / SE Asia for The Apron String Travelers"
239758,504736,2016/8/4,5,This is a sensational salad. Especially love the dressing. Peanut butter makes everything better. :) Added some cherry tomatoes too. Thanks for posting.
80353,517428,2014/8/5,4,"This tasted &#039;just OK&#039; as written, but going with my gut, and dissolving a little sugar in some apple cider vinegar and adding that, it was really good."
400708,531158,2018/4/23,4,"Was looking for ways to use my new Instant Pot and found this, couldn't be easier and the chops came out tender and moist, perfect timing and an easy learning recipe."
2000974150,531158,2018/11/22,2,"The boneless chops were dry as dust. In fact, everything I"
335999,497996,2014/1/3,5,Marvelous recipe.  I just held the red peppers until the last half hour of cooking time and added some kalamata olives at the same time.  I also made the sauce with a roux instead of the cornstarch.  Just a personal preference.  Delicious!
2324285,493177,2013/1/21,5,"Well I had to try this when I first saw the recipe, as I never really liked the parsley-based tabbouleh.  The spinach in this makes it so much tastier.  I think I have a new go-to side dish  for whenever I make Persian/Arabic food!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
599450,493177,2013/3/3,4,"A very nice tabbouleh recipe made as directed. Enjoyed some the next morning with my fried eggs. Thanks, loof! Made for Aussie Kiwi Recipe Swap #73."
1902202,514180,2014/11/24,4,Amazingly beautiful and tasty. Would be 5 stars but I would cut the raspberry sauce in half because it made way too much. Also there was cheesecake mixture that wouldn&#039;t fit into the 12 muffin tins. I skipped the lemon zest and used Stouffers Chocolate Animal Crackers for my cookie crumbs.
50509,527710,2016/8/2,4,"This was tasty and had the bonus of being hands-off, once you do the prep. I made one serving, opted for two whole eggs, to avoid the leftover egg yolks, and used goat cheese, because that's what I had."
2206320,494953,2013/2/10,5,Fantastic Recipe!!!!  Looks amazing!!  Great job!
418718,494953,2013/2/10,5,very good recipe!!! good luck !!
2440395,494953,2013/2/10,5,Fabulicious!!!  :o)
654393,494953,2013/2/10,5,Looks so delicious and the recipe is one I will try.
306726,494953,2013/2/10,5,This recipe is loaded with everything delicious!!!!
2198132,494953,2013/2/10,5,"Wow, this has a little bit of everything - sounds fabulous!"
2201427,494953,2013/2/10,5,Sounds wonderful!!!
2204786,494953,2013/2/10,5,Loaded w/flavor and love!!!

2200666,494953,2013/2/10,5,"Love the flavor combination you created here, sounds delicious!"
2662969,494953,2013/2/10,5,Looks great will try this one!
2423302,494953,2013/2/11,5,Outstanding :)
542159,514720,2014/7/15,5,Ok it might not win a beauty contest but it sure does win the taste contest. Both DH and I loved the Italian Parmesan dressing and thought the mushroom and tomato made a nice addition. Think it would be equally good without the mozzarella for those days when you are watching your fat or calories. Thanks for the post.
2000723043,502415,2016/8/11,5,"Great recipe, though my sauce was not as thick as the one in the picture. However, it was more like the sauce I had at the restaurant. This is the first recipe I've tried that I don't think I could improve on. It was perfect!"
2001565162,502415,2017/6/2,5,"Came out pretty great the first time I tried it! I want to say even better than BJ's! For the sauce I didn't have heavy cream so I used whole milk, flour and some more butter to create a roux in order to thicken the sauce and it turned out great. I also made their white cheddar mashed potatoes and a roasted fennel recipe I picked up online and it was a fantastic dinner!"
126440,520590,2015/5/20,5,Great flavor and easy to do.  Could add more fruit if you wanted.
498271,502353,2013/10/7,5,What a yummy bread!  Easy to make and love the oat and honey combo.  This bread has a hearty flavor but baked up light and soft.  Great plain and toasted - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for My3Chefs 2013
430507,502353,2013/12/26,5,"I haven&#039;t made bread in a while, but I wanted to test out my new mixer. I made this bread this morning, following the directions and recipe exactly, and my bread came out delicious. I baked it for 40 minutes but could have probably baked it for a few more minutes. We let it cool a bit but not all the way before cutting. I love the honey flavor, and the crust is delicious. Next time, I&#039;ll actually let it cool before diving in!"
2360164,502353,2014/1/11,5,This bread was delicious!  The only change I made was that I used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 2  1/2 cups of all purpose flour.  Love the honey-oats combo!  I will be making this again.
1802602671,502353,2014/3/20,4,"I made it with a graham flour because I like the added density. You can taste the honey in it which is great. This is a very easy bread, it does get hard pretty fast though (it might be the flour I used)."
1803360234,502353,2014/11/17,0,"This is a very good recipe.   One thing I did was melt the butter, add the milk, water and honey then heat until warm in the microwave and put this into your mixer bowl before you add the dry ingredients.   Always put liquid in the bowl first then add the dry ingredients.   Mixes much better that way.   This is an old bakers tip (I used to own a bakery)."
2172354,502353,2015/1/15,4,Made this over the weekend since I had lots of oats and wanted to hide some of it in the bread for the children and they loved it! I think the sticky honey and oat topping attracted them. It was delicious!
1803579654,502353,2015/1/16,5,"This bread is awesome! I have made it three times now and doubled the recipe each time to make two loaves. The bread turns out nice and fluffy. Yummy, Yummy goodness. I did make a couple of changes to this time. Instead of waiting the five minutes to add flour, I began adding it as soon as I realized the dough was still going to be too sticky. And I waited until I pulled the bread from the oven before spreading honey on the top. OH MY!! It smells so good. Husband loves it! All for about 20 cents per loaf! Will use this recipe again and again."
126440,502353,2015/2/20,5,Turned out great even though I forgot to top with honey.  Great for toast in the morning.
2000387614,502353,2015/8/6,5,"I made this bread yesterday, it was so easy and the taste is awesome. I will be making this on a regular basis...you won&#039;t be sorry...try it !"
1803218957,502353,2015/12/16,5,"I made this recipe for the first time 2 days ago. The instructions are easy to follow and the finished bread is light and tasty.  I used this bread to make a grilled cheese sandwich and it grilled very well, browned evenly and didn&#039;t fall apart.  So I then put some slices in my toaster and was very pleased with the toast. My 3 year old grandchildren even liked it!  The only step I did differently was to proof my yeast fort before I added it to the other ingredients.  A very good bread for every day eating."
2000970175,502353,2016/4/12,5,Delicious!
2001089305,502353,2016/7/15,0,This recipe is the best for sandwiches and toast. It has enough texture and firmness to be sliced and holds up well when you add other ingredients. I make two loaves with the one recipe. One loaf I added sunflower seeds or any seeds that I wish to add to it. The other loaf I just add the oats. My family loves it and so do I. I don't have a bread maker but do make it in the kitchen aid bowl. I run the blade about 15 minutes and it is just a beautiful loaf. (Paddle blade rather than dough hook) Enjoy ��
2001359569,502353,2017/1/20,5,Made this a few times and it has been great each time. It is the best sandwich bread we have found. This is my daughter's favorite bread that I make.
2001673641,502353,2017/8/15,4,"Fun, easy recepie! Will go into our favorites"
2001932776,502353,2018/1/15,4,Pretty darn good. Used sesame seeds as a topping instead
2789803,496879,2013/4/18,0,It is not the original recipe of kuku sabzi the original one is the mix of vegtabls and eggs just not bread or any thing else i am telling you as as iranian chef
2597942,504570,2013/8/1,5,"Truely a &quot;no-brainer&quot; here... I knew I would love this recipe from the start! The gravy is almost identical to how I make my German Rouladen gravy. Hubby and I loved it! So simple to make and quick. I served it with greens on the side (sorry about my poor picture). I really enjoyed the parsley potatoes that go with it (but I must confess, I made and used your Recipe #504455 for ZWT9). Normally, I will serve mashed with our gravy meals, but not anymore. It is really yummy (and extremely cheap to make)! Thank you for posting your recipe(s). (Made for &quot;New Kids&quot; tag)"
679953,504570,2013/8/8,5,"Great recipe.  I did use ground chuck, and usually when I make a recipe that says 1 cup, or 1 soup cup of water, I gradually add the water as it is cooking, and then stir.  I was satisfied with 3/4 cup of water, only adjustment. The sauce was great, and I decided to take a little of the gravy, and mix it with a tablespoon of butter that I served with some rolls for us. Thanks for posting this.  Made for PRMR tag."
2734669,504570,2013/11/12,5,"I made this for dinner using ground venison. I liked it very much. I think my wife would have preferred it with ground beef, so next time I will try that. The gravy is tasty. Thank you."
50969,504570,2013/11/13,4,"I made this recipe on 11/12/13 for mine and my SO&#039;s dinner, and most importantly for pammyowl&#039;s Cook-A-Thon . If your looking for a fancy dish that uses a lot of hard  to pronounce ingredients,stay away from this recipe.But if you&#039;re searching for a &quot; Comfort Food &quot; type dish,then your search is over. :) There were a couple of changes made,but I don&#039;t think the integrity of the recipe was compromised at all. Instead of using the instant onion, about 1/4 cup of chopped sweet onion was used. Since I prefer Golden Mushroom soup, it was used instead of the soup called for.  I thought the gravy was dark enough, the Kitchen Bouquet wasn&#039;t used. And mashed potatoes, were used instead of diced. Both my SO and I enjoyed the simplicity of this warm and comforting dish. &quot; Keep Smiling :) &quot;"
47723,504570,2014/6/15,5,I made this to recipe and it was awesome! I wouldn&#039;t change a thing. Total comfort food.
2002280348,502353,2018/9/21,5,This bread is so delicious and was absolutely gorgeous when I pulled it out of the oven!
2002370179,502353,2018/12/17,5,"Fantastic bread. This is probably my favorite recipe so far. I did make two modifications however. Instead of 3 cups of all-purpose flour I used 1 cup each of rye, wheat, and bread flours. I also added one egg. It was fabulous!"
2001336013,524487,2017/1/4,4,"The salad was great! I followed the directions originally for the dressing, but I ended up having to add water to thin it out a bit."
1800086837,501521,2013/10/16,5,Fantastic!!!
1801123324,501521,2013/12/23,5,This was Amazing!!!!!! I added more corn and it was Great. My best friend loves Chick Fil A&#039;s soup and tonight she had 2 bowls :-) Thank you for posting.
540475,501521,2014/1/22,5,Loved it! Followed the recipe then added 3 tbsp flour to thicken it up a little. I&#039;ll definitely make this again. Thanks for posting!
1802400463,501521,2014/1/23,4,"I think this recipe is close, but Chick fil A&#039;s has pieces of red in it. Next time, I may try this with salsa instead of taco seasoning. Thanks for sharing!"
1803229425,501521,2014/10/14,3,I tried this over the weekend but I used a slow-cooker instead so it would be done when we got home from Church. I followed it perfectly and I will say that it was pretty runny but the flavor was ok.  I ended up adding two more packets of Taco Seasoning (for my taste) and I added 1c of Corn Starch to thicken it up.  After that it was perfect... Thank you for the starting point.
2000010699,501521,2015/2/20,3,"The flavor was ok but not anywhere near as good as CFA&#039;s. The soup was very watery where CFA&#039;s is super thick. The flavor needed more kick. It wasn&#039;t even close to being spicy. I gave it 3 stars because it was a good soup to make, but it certainly isn&#039;t a copy cat recipe!"
2000151970,501521,2015/4/20,4,Great recipe.  I added 3-4 TBS of corn flour(masa) and a total of 2 packs of taco seasoning.  This will make the soup thicker and look like similar to CFA version of the soup.
2001356467,501521,2017/1/18,4,"Found this recipe a few winters ago and I like it! I don't enjoy cooking, but this is more of a &quot;mix and stir&quot; dish, and it's easy since I use a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the deli."
2001363889,501521,2017/1/23,4,"I actually did marketing for Chick-fil-a year ago, so I am very familiar with this soup. One of my absolute faves!! I guess my way is a little complicated. I always use my crock pot. 1st the evening before I boil chicken thighs, and use some of that stock instead of only using the canned chicken broth. I boil the thighs for a few hours, then remove the skin &amp; shred the chicken and right away add it to the crock pot. 2nd I puree 1 can of reduced sodium great northern beans, it helps to thicken the soup. I use dry beans in the soup itself. I add a few dashes of Lawry’s season salt, pepper &amp; a little salt to taste. I put it all in the night before and let it cook on high until 5 pm the next day."
2001540011,501521,2017/5/16,5,"The homemade version was a lot less salty, which was really nice! I'd reduce the garlic to 1/4 of one clove though because it was very strong with 1/2 a clove."
2001458689,501521,2017/6/26,5,"I served it with a few slices of fresh cut hass avocado and a squeeze of lime juice to my tweaked recipe, if you're into that (see in tweaks) and prepare to be wowed with flavor!"
2001389676,513221,2017/2/12,5,"I have never made steak on the stove or in the oven, and this was FABULOUS! Thank you for a great recipe, it made my day!"
1801316385,510454,2014/6/17,5,"I love this! I&#039;m usually not a soup eater kind of guy, but had some cooked rabbit to work with and I put it all in a pot, heated it up, and loved it. I can imagine that chicken would be good too. I had the meat precooked and just heated it all up together."
2001853159,501521,2017/12/11,0,I added can of cream of chicken and 2 packs taco seasoning instead of 1. Also added little constarch ti thicken. Great!
2001979289,501521,2018/2/7,0,Do not have heavy cream. Can cream of chicken soup be used to substitute
2001995485,501521,2018/2/17,5,"I used a large can of cream of chicken. Everything else I did the same. Was exactly like it, thick and all. Thank you so much!!"
2002105633,501521,2018/4/9,5,Delicious. I use my own broth after boiling the chicken and throw in celery and carrots to broth. The frozen white corn is also delicious
2812082,495408,2013/5/5,5,Tastyy!!!!!!!!!!!
2597942,512892,2014/3/11,5,I made these for lunch a couple of days ago. I will write a full review when I get back on-line. Loved the burger. (Made for PRMR)
143318,500046,2013/9/25,4,Pretty alternative to hummus! Worked well as a spread on pitas filled with veggies for my lunchbox.
80353,495338,2013/3/2,5,"Very yummy and easy with good, clear instructions.  I was only allowed a nibble off one drumstick as the kids ate them all up.  Clearly, they know a good thing when they taste it."
128473,495338,2013/3/2,4,"We enjoyed the chicken prepared this way. It was quick and easy to make.  Made exactly as written, it was tender, juicy and had a mild flavor. It made for a nice meal served with boiled potatoes and spicy corn.  Nice use of contest ingredients, good luck in the contest."
254614,495338,2013/3/4,5,This is a great recipe. I used cut up wings (minature drummies). I love marinate recipes and <br/>Japanese vinegars and sauces. I baked 10 minutes on each side. I served with my Oriental Almond Ponsu Slaw.  The mix of the marinate flavor on the meat and the lime of the slaw was<br/>great. Thanks.
239758,495338,2013/3/4,5,"Love the balance of flavours. I made half a batch, but used the full amount of ponzu sauce. Served with baked potatoes, roasted tomatoes and a green salad. Good luck in the contest."
2001246679,519204,2016/11/15,3,50 min is WAY too long. I checked at 25 min and they were over cooked. There is enough streusel to top 2 dozen muffins.
2001331875,519204,2017/1/1,5,That is a very delicious muffin that I ever tasted
482376,493737,2013/3/28,4,"Excellent! It makes a good amount, too. I&#039;ll be glad to have this on my salads all week. Thank you for posting! Made for Spring 2013 PAC."
37449,502998,2013/7/22,5,"Lovely salad, I replaced the Begium endive with romaine(it&#039;s what I had on hand). Loved the fresh dill and feta. Thanks! Made for ZWT#9 2013."
39835,495338,2013/12/19,5,"Very good chicken. I used regular soy sauce (instead of ponzu), Italian seasoning instead of the oregano, salt and pepper. Thanks for sharing!"
2001581399,495338,2017/6/12,0,These are amazing!! My family loved them!
1925885,502998,2016/8/16,5,"I love chopped salads, and this is one of the best I've had. I think it was the dill, because all my guests were raving about that. So good that, after dessert, my niece announced &quot;nobody touch the leftover salad - that's MINE!&quot; Thanks for posting - this is definitely a keeper! Made for Culinary Quest 2016."
169430,513469,2014/3/2,5,"Totally wonderful comfort food. It&#039;s been down into the -50&#039;s with the wind chill and this old house does have some leaks that we haven&#039;t found yet so a hot comfort meal made with favorite things was most welcome. My only change was to use homemade pasta sauce out of the freezer that I make with no sugar. Thanks for posting this yummy recipe, DH placed dib&#039;s on the leftovers! :D"
1620171,495346,2013/3/1,5,I LOVED this. It was so easy to make and delicious. It also lasted me two weeks in the fridge so I got to use it on a few things as well as for the BBQ sauce in a calzone recipe found on here.
178427,495346,2013/3/2,5,Great BBQ sauce! Super flavor and easy to make. I used it on grilled chicken. Since I really enjoy making my own sauces I know I'll make this one often. Thanks for sharing and Good Luck in the contest.
128473,495346,2013/3/2,5,"I really enjoyed this quick and easy to make BBQ Sauce.  It was thick, rich, smooth and velvety.  The sauce had a lovely dark, robust, hot and spicy flavor.  I served it with Steak and drizzled over Jerked Pork Tenderloin it was delicious.  It coats really well.  Great use of contest ingredients, Good Luck in the Contest."
2001591131,502009,2017/6/19,0,Are these eggs direct from the refrigerator or room temperature?
865936,507026,2013/9/19,4,"I liked all the components of this spread. The egg, I think was more for texture and perhaps to add protein? I left this"
1052873,496781,2013/4/4,5,"This was very tasty. It would have been much better if I had found crescent roll dough in a can. I had to make my own and it&#039;s just not flaky enough. I used leftover ham, onions, and mushrooms instead of chicken. The recipe was missing some ingredients but I figured it out from the directions. I used 1 cup Fage 0%, 1 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella, and an egg for the cheese layer."
2002015205,501497,2018/3/4,5,This is the second time making this. It's a wonderful thing to add to my recipes. I also sent it to my sister in Florida because she's always needing anything new. I also do not eat red meat and this is extremely filling and really takes the place of meat.
2549237,505085,2014/4/30,5,"This was so good!  I had to sub out sharp yellow cheddar for the sharp white cheddar because of our grocery budget and the white cheddar being a whopping $8.49 for 4 ounces and I used Whole Wheat Elbow Macaroni as that&#039;s what I always use, but besides that I followed the rest of the ingredients precisely.  I opted not to bake ours because it&#039;s been a long day and I just wanted to get dinner on the table quickly and we didn&#039;t think it needed the baking time.  I served this with broccoli and cauliflower on the side and all 5 of us really liked it.  It says &quot;Grown-Up&quot;, but don&#039;t let that shy you away from it if you have children, because this was very family friendly.  Thank you for a great comfort food meal tonight Baking Barb.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
107135,503849,2013/7/25,5,fast great tasting love cauliflower zwt9
2377436,493861,2013/1/24,5,"This chicken was crunchy and delicious.  We are putting this in our ""make again"" cookbook.  The ranch worked so well with the chicken and could be tasted throughout."
2597942,493861,2013/2/21,5,"This was very moist and very yummy. The whole family are ranch-aholics, so it went over well."
482376,493861,2013/2/25,5,"Yummy chicken! I enjoyed the marinade of Greek yogurt, chives and the ranch mix. The chicken came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. You could really taste the ranch flavor, too. Thank you and good luck in the contest! :)"
204024,493861,2013/3/2,5,Yoghurt and ranch mix made a nice marinade and held the crust in place. Chicken came out of the oven crisp and tasty; the spritz of cooking spray is a great tip.  Both of the young adults in our household commented that it needed a dip: maybe more ranch dressing?
227978,510169,2018/6/14,5,"This was not only easy to make, but it's super delicious. I made the recipe as written and didn't make any changes in ingredients or process. The scant amount of anise and vanilla bean used in this recipe actually goes a long way in producing a lovely flavor combo for this homemade ice cream. We have an ice cream maker (that I wanted to use for the churning and freezing stages), but I couldn't find it. So I ended up opting for the plain freezer method for the final freezing step, and it worked out nicely. It was still creamy and silky smooth, and it served up wonderfully. This would be great over vanilla pound cake. Thanks for sharing a wonderful &quot;keeper&quot; of a recipe, KateL. I'll have to find our ice cream maker, because I foresee several batches of this in our near future."
37449,515713,2014/5/16,5,"I must admit, I made this without the horseradish, but otherwise loved it!  I used mozzerella cheese and whole wheat hamburger buns. Thanks for a delicious lunch!"
107135,503135,2013/8/10,5,"mr picky liked these alot they are more like a doughnut ,sweet,i used carbonated  water ,they really fluff up.and soak up the oil .zwt9 update  hes asked them 3 more times he REALLY likes them and they super easy to make."
2000100417,520359,2015/3/30,5,"OMG, this is the Paseo Pork Roast sandwich. Looking for this recipe forever. It&#039;s perfect. The bun Paseo uses is the Macrina bakery bun, but this pork is spot on. The sauce is unreal! Must ry for any Paseo fan!"
1881702,535314,2018/4/23,0,I love garlic; add garlic.
2393017,502642,2016/1/21,5,"A great recipe that was a hit with the whole family. I didn&#039;t use the outlined cooking suggestion with plastic wrap and foil, but rather cooked it in a crock pot for about 10 hrs on low--it turned out great--very moist and tasty. The pork shoulder I had was about 3-4 lbs so I used only 1/2 portions of the spices, and only about 3/4 tsp of black pepper. We will be making this one again!"
2001742444,535314,2018/4/25,5,Love the recipe. Next time I would purchase the mushroom caps with the gills removed. It's a little difficult removing the gills and keeping the sides intake which keep the toppings inside.
288058,535314,2018/6/20,5,I've made this many times. Very tasty.
2000370905,535314,2018/7/14,5,This turned out fantastic! Both my 2 year old and my 1 year old gobbled these up. I will definitely make these again.
2597942,501059,2014/4/28,5,"I made this dip to serve as an appetizer on Easter. It is very similar to one that I already make, (but mine is served cold as a spread), so I knew this was gonna be delicious... and it was! The only thing I did a bit different was that I sauteed the chopped onion and bell pepper, (just ever so slightly), before adding everything into the mini crock. Everyone really enjoyed this dip. Thanks for posting. (Made for PAC 2014)"
2001802166,536930,2018/10/6,0,Where are the skull molds mentioned???
865936,522862,2016/7/24,4,This is a lot of fun to eat. The dipping sauce is a perfect complement to noodles. I stirred some wasabi in the dipping sauce and that was enjoyable.
280271,499158,2014/8/28,5,Delicious! This is so easy to prepare and it has a wonderful fresh flavor...We just loved it...I had very think chops so they took no time at all to cook...This recipe is worthy of serving to company...made it for &quot;What&#039;s on the Menu&quot; game...=)
135470,502817,2013/8/27,4,"This made a quick and tasty appetizer. I could do without the mint, but other than that enjoyed the flavors. Made for ZWT 9"
1361848,505179,2013/11/17,3,The yogurt separated but it tasted ok. The chicken may have been juicier if it was pounded out first. My piece of chicken was pretty thick.
1620171,501348,2013/10/24,5,"Delicious and easy, made for My Food Odyssey."
2399085,503173,2013/9/28,5,Made for PRMR! I loved this. My kids thought it was too much mustard but what do they know? I will make next time with a tad less mustard and a tad more honey to suit their taste... But in my book these were great.
226863,503173,2015/2/12,5,"I used what I had handy....chicken tenders. So I reduced the cooking time a bit so they didn&#039;t dry out.  The sauce was perfect.  And this is so easy to make that I know I will make it often, especially on a work day!  Made for FYC tag game on Yuku.  Thanks for sharing!"
128473,503173,2017/4/27,5,"We really enjoyed the chicken prepared this way Teresa. It was very yummy, tender, juicy and full of flavor. Made as written but used a Old fashioned Dijon (all I had in the house), it worked beautifully with the recipe. The seeds gave a nice burst of additional mustard flavor. Thank you for sharing a recipe we will enjoy again. Made for Went to Market tag game."
2549237,502879,2013/7/16,5,"These chicken wings are just great!  They remind me a lot of Butter and Garlic wings that we get at Buffalo Wild Wings.  I didn&#039;t broil these because it is so hot today, but I did make them on the grill, which produced a great smoky flavor.  We really loved these and will be making them again.  Thanks Lavender Lynn.  Made for New Kids On The Block tag game."
2000182771,502879,2015/6/30,5,Easy and fabulous.  I broiled the chicken wings until they were a little dark (almost charred) on one side and then flipped them to ensure a crispy finish.  After eating my friend said &quot;I wish there was more chicken&quot; and then commenced to eating the rest of the batch.  Excellent recipe to add a little variety to baked chicken.   I would definitely use it again.
157425,502879,2016/8/8,5,"I found this recipe for my hubby who loves chicken wings. Marinated the wings for about six hours and instead of broiling he cooked them on the grill. Made Lavender Lynn's recipe for the mojo marinade, http://www.food.com/recipe/mojo-502878, and it was great! The wings were enjoyed and I know we will be making them again. Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest 2016 - Bahamas."
1226388,503333,2013/8/22,5,I really enjoyed this.  I love using my rice cooker and this recipe added a lot of flavor to the rice.  Bonus is that the leftovers are halfway to being fried rice!  Made for ZWT9
185926,510027,2013/12/26,4,I found this on Eating Well.com and made it for Christmas dinner.  It was excellent and my husband thinks it&#039;s the best fruit pie he&#039;s ever had.  Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar on the crust as it was a little too sweet.  It&#039;s a tender and buttery short bread crust that complements the tart-sweet of the filling and the very sweet of the meringue.
2688819,495143,2013/2/11,5,This sounds elegant and tasty. I want to try it soon.
226867,511708,2018/9/28,5,"I love Greek yogurt mixed with stuff! This was a great combo - although I didn't have flax seeds, so added some sliced banana! (I know they're not remotely similar!) Forgot to take a photo, so I'll do that next time!"
157425,511708,2018/10/13,5,I am not a big breakfast eater but I really enjoyed this muesli! Had some fresh blueberries in the fridge so added them to the mixture. This would be a nice treat any time of day. Made and reviewed for the Football Pool - Week #3
306726,497326,2013/3/22,5,So yummy and easy to prepare!!!!
1592049,497326,2013/3/22,5,So Delicious!! Love All These Fantastic Flavors :-)

2420655,497326,2013/3/23,5,I made two pans of this!  I added a photo of the one that I added potato chips to the top!  Thanks.. the family loved it!

2201427,497326,2013/3/23,5,What a wonderful recipe!!! Great use of just 5 ingredients!!
2423055,497326,2013/3/24,5,Wow does ever sound good!! My husband would go nuts over this!!
654393,497326,2013/3/24,5,So simple and sounds divine.  Never thought to put this in the oven! YUM!
1359842,497326,2013/3/24,5,This recipe was awesome. Thanks!
2680727,497326,2013/3/24,5,Great ingredient combination
2414156,497326,2013/3/24,5,Delicious Chowder!
228458,497716,2013/8/18,4,"This was a fun adventure for breakfast this morning! I had some trouble getting the batter to cook through without flipping...I did finally resort to flipping for a few seconds just before removing from the pan. I probably shouldn&#039;t have put &quot;pancakes&quot; in the minds of my kids before serving, as these taste nothing like a typical American pancake LOL. The yeast flavor is pretty strong, but surprisingly the turmeric is not. We enjoyed these a number of ways; my kids liked them spread with jam, my baby liked them dipped in maple syrup, and I loved the honey/butter topping (make that even if you don&#039;t make the pancakes, it was great!!). I don&#039;t know if my pan was smaller, but I got waaayy more than 12...more like 24! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
47892,493857,2013/2/19,4,I subbed barberries for the raisins and served the salad over mixed greens. The salad dressing was fiddely and for some reason the ingredients wouldn't mix well and not much eye appeal to the dressing (although we liked it.) A meyer lemon replaced standard lemon. The rutabaga was so small and impossible to peel that I finely grated it without any problems. I think I would not serve the salad over greens next time either. It would be better on its own. Made for Veg Tag and SUN and SPICE Event/February.
2639433,493857,2016/5/15,0,"I bought a rutabaga last night and wanted to mash it, but then thought why not do something different? Didn't add any dried fruit in my version, but very happy with apple-rutabaga combination! Threw in some chopped pecans and sunflower seeds too. Thank you for your recipe. :)"
2000745868,512954,2016/1/6,5,These are so good! They taste like banana bread with blueberries. I used gluten free flour and you can&#039;t even tell they are gluten free.
220348,501171,2013/6/21,5,"I enjoyed this drink earlier this week, and now that there is a heatwave coming on, there is another reason to enjoy it. I like the mix of peaches and grenadine."
2585084,501171,2013/6/21,5,"Smooth, cold, and creamy delight...I served this as a before dinner cocktail.  It was a wonderful prelude to the spicy Thai dish that I prepared."
1925885,501171,2013/6/21,4,"This was quite a yummy drink and made dinner prep much more fun!  Followed the recipe exactly, but next time won&#039;t be adding the honey and will compensate for the lost calories with more rum.  LOL!  We couldn&#039;t taste the honey and the drink was pretty sweet - so leaving it out shouldn&#039;t make a difference in taste.  This is definitely a cocktail we&#039;ll be making again once we tweak it to our taste.  Thanks for coming up with this lovely libation!"
128473,501171,2013/6/22,5,"Arrr this was a perfect rum drink for this pirate.  A nice tasting tropical drink.  I really enjoyed the flavor, it was not too sweet, just perfect for this hot humid day.  Flavorful and refreshing.  Very creative use of contest ingredients, Good Luck in the contest."
383346,501171,2013/8/5,4,Interesting taste with the peach and ginger.  For us it was a little bit too sweet so next time I&#039;ll omit the honey and probably also the grenadine.  And maybe add a little bit more rum.  Thanks NorthwestGal :)  Made for ZWT9
370907,523584,2016/4/21,3,For me this had too much cocoa powder.  I will play around with this recipe but it would need more sweetner with this amount of cocoa powder.  I did add about 10 soaked almonds also.
1680722,505115,2014/4/16,5,"I prepared this delicious veg dish!&lt;br/&gt;It was not easy to slice and transfer the cauliflower slices to the skillet and then to the tray, but finally it worked. The topping and the relish are superb as well, they fit perfect with the roasted cauliflour and look preatty.&lt;br/&gt;A really great way to prepare roasted cauliflower, I recommend this dish!"
2123645,505115,2018/3/11,4,Delicious! Love the tomato sauce and relish. Very savory and the flavors go together so well.
679953,508965,2014/3/2,5,"Excellent on some buttered popcorn.  I used some hickory-smoked salt I saw at one of our speciality shops we have here, and made the recipe down the line.  Going to try it on some fries for lunch tomorrow.  Nicely flavored, and will use again.  Made for PRMR Tag"
422893,513874,2014/9/18,4,"Love how simple this is, just throw it all in the pot and let it cook, great for a busy night. I will be making this again for sure!"
606850,513874,2016/2/13,5,"I love this wonderpot. Even tastier, though, is Budget Bytes&#039; Spinach and Artichoke Wonderpot! http://www.budgetbytes.com/2013/10/spinach-artichoke-wonderpot/ Just as quick and simple, still only one pot, and a uniquely delicious flavor!"
169430,498103,2014/4/16,5,"This is very good! I did omit the scotch bonnet and used just jalapeno. I don&#039;t think I would have been able to eat it with the scotch bonnet, lol.  As I was alone for dinner tonight I made just one serving and it made a delicious meal. So glad I decided to try it. Made for PAC, Spring 2014 :D"
1803544937,498103,2015/1/2,5,Loved it! This recipe is definitely a keeper.
2001069391,518670,2016/7/20,0,Not zero carb. Extremely high calories.
2002294747,518670,2018/10/7,5,"Added a little extra garlic. Topped with Easy Keto Marinara Sauce, diced onion, chopped fresh mushroom, chopped spinach, banana pepper rings, cooked sausage and bacon. Sprinkled a little extra cheese on toppings. Sprayed a little canola spray on top to moisten spinach and mushrooms. Turned out excellent!"
498271,498925,2013/10/10,5,This is fantastic oatmeal!  It really does have a wonderful cinnamon-roll flavor.  I think the water and oatmeal measurements might be backwards - I used 1 3/4 c water and 1 c oatmeal and it was perfect.  The butter added a nice richness and I just loved the topping.  It seems like a lot at first but it works because the oatmeal itself is not at all sweet.  Really loved this - it&#039;s a keeper  - thanks for sharing!  Made for My3Chefs 2013
839886,506553,2014/4/26,5,"I was looking for a good Gluten Free Blueberry Muffin, and I found an awesome one!  I added a little gluten free oatmeal to the Streusel topping, super! It is a sweet recipe...even by decreasing the sugar in the muffins, they were a little one the sweet side for my taste.  But the family devoured them! Thank you for the recipe!!"
50509,507134,2013/10/28,5,"This is a very delicious dish. I did cut down the soy sauce significantly  made about half the recipe, and did not use more than a tbl or so of soy sauce, but that did not detract from the dish at all. I did reduce the cornstarch and added a bit of water, to compensate. I can see using this sauce on other things."
219942,502752,2013/8/10,5,"YUM. Forget canned sauce, this is special and easy to make. Loved the hint of orange and cinnamon, and this sauce is not only tasty, but pretty, too!  &quot;Water to cover&quot; wasn&#039;t exact, I added about 1 1/4 cups, and cooked it about 1 1/2 hours to get the consistency I wanted. I didn&#039;t adjust the sugar at all, it was sweet with a tartness that is perfect. The house smelled wonderful. I halved the recipe, but will make more later in the year and add to my holiday gift baskets! Thanks for a keeper! ZWT9"
2001424306,518474,2018/2/4,5,This is so delicious. I had to make my own Creole seasoning...turned out great. Used Mild Italian Sausage. I used a 540ml can of Aylmers stewed chunky Italian tomatoes and blended them til smooth in my Vitamix. Also added about 1 cup of Simply Natural Organic tomato &amp; basil pasta sauce (Costco?) to make up the 28oz of crushed tomatoes the recipe called for. I used 1/2 of a large spanish onion and I used garlic paste from the tube instead of minced. This is definitely a keeper. Served it with Garlic Bubble Bread.
163112,504587,2013/8/1,5,"Oh myyyyyyy....these potatoes are rolling on the floor swooningly good!  I wish I had a pic of dd doing this, lol.  Think stop, drop &amp; roll with your tongue hanging out &amp; your eyes rolling into the back of your head....  Anyway...made as directed.  Used 1/2 cream, 1/2 half &amp; half.  The only problem was the very center of a couple potatoes weren&#039;t fully cooked.  This makes quite a bit but we are so happy for the leftovers!  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers!"
107135,504587,2013/8/3,5,czech mr picky is very happy with this easy recipe
242766,505619,2013/8/25,5,"Yum!!  We loved this refreshing, tropical daiquiri!!  It goes together very quickly and goes down very smoothly.  I used 1 tsp. grated ginger and that was perfect for us.  We didn&#039;t think the drink was too sweet, it was just right.  Made for ZWT9 SE Asia for The Apron String Travelers."
526666,505619,2013/8/26,5,"Yum yum yum! The food editor of my local paper saw a pic of these, posted on my FB page, and said &quot;Pineapple AND booze? Heck yeah!&quot; I was flattered, as you should be momaphet! Thanks for sharing a lovely cocktail for the tour!"
539686,505619,2013/8/30,5,"A taste treat...I really like the addition of ginger, it gave it a unique bit of bite to cut the sweetness of the pineapple. Thanks for posting, made for ZWT #9!"

1800369514,509898,2013/12/8,5,This soup was delicious and super easy. I would suggest a little less broccoli and to cook on high 2-4 hours!! Other than that this soup is amazing!!!
280271,513030,2014/3/16,4,I loved the sweet tart taste in this dish...hubby didn&#039;t care for the flavor...I will be making this again...just not when the hubby is home...=)
37449,504587,2013/8/8,5,Easy and nice and creamy. I scaled the recipe way down and enjoyed it for lunch. Thanks! Made by a team Hot Stuff member for ZWT 2013.
242766,504587,2013/8/8,5,Yummy!  We really loved these creamy potatoes.  It is hard to believe that something so simple could taste so good. The fresh dill really turns the flavor up a notch. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Made for ZWT9 Scandinavia for The Apron String Travelers.
329769,504587,2013/9/1,5,Reviewed for ZWT9 - I made this dish using a blended gf flour and extra cream. Totally loved it and this dish makes a lovely potato side
1072593,504572,2015/3/4,5,"My third Asian dish I fixed this week.  I know, I know...I probably need an intervention at this point.  Fabulous dish!"
169430,515301,2016/11/22,5,"I made this using a rice and whole grain mix and added a cubed chicken breast (cooked with the rice mix) to make it a one dish meal. I used the baharat as suggested by CG and I'm really glad that I did. It came out delicious and it was much enjoyed, The flavors are a real delight and this will certainly be made again soon!"
128473,516604,2014/6/11,3,This is a lovely recipe.  The french toast was thin and had a nice subtle orange flavor.  It had a soft crust and didn&#039;t puff up.  I garnished it with a little icing sugar and a dab of butter.  Next time I will add a little cream and orange rind to the recipe. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
1802585047,518068,2014/8/21,5,Nice looking tarts and the Chocolate with A1 sauce sounds delicious!

1676220,496577,2013/3/19,5,Made this the other night and it was very good.  Made as directed.  Rest of my family are not big cake eaters so it was around for a few days and did stay moist.  Thanks for the recipe.
1800026970,496577,2017/10/6,5,I just made this cake this morning from apples picked from our Apple tree. The cake is amazing. Thanks so much!

This sweet treat was perfection, perfectly cooked, great flavors and nice textures. I adore coconut and macadamia nuts, this felt tailor made for me. I opted to heat the maple rum syrup so happy I did.  Thanks so much for sharing this creation, which I will make again.  Good Luck in the Contest."
131126,501162,2013/6/22,5,I made this as &quot;breakfast for dinner&quot; and served with sausage links.  The french toast is rich &amp; the flavors excellent.  I particularly liked the crunch topping. I did whimp out and use rum extract rather the rum.  This would be great Sunday breakfast too.  Thank you for sharing the recipe &amp; good luck in the contest!
80353,501162,2013/6/22,5,"What an ingenious use of contest ingredients!  The whole family happily ate this for breakfast on a leisurely Sunday and no one complained.  The crunch topping is brilliant!  Good luck, chef, whoever you are.  You were inspired when you created this treat. :-)"

227978,506532,2013/12/30,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe, SB6.  It&#039;s so easy to make, too.  Although we had it for dinner (in place of plain dinner rolls), it would be a great appetizer recipe for serving during Super Bowl or some other game.  Made for your win in the 2013 Football Pool."
45751583,506532,2014/5/26,4,Awesome!  My family loved this bread! I will make again!  Used olive oil as well
55827,530004,2017/2/20,5,"I made this today using what was on hand. I only had a 1 1/2 LBS. of chicken, I didn't have any celery, and I had green onions that needed to be used . I felt that the measurement for the spices was way too much so I toned them down, using only teaspoons where the recipe called for tablespoons. Happy I did because it turned out perfectly! The cook time was spot on, everything was cooked to perfection. The chicken was tender as were the veggies. I love the addition of parmesan cheese in the dumplings! I also noticed that the corn measurements were omitted in the ingredients list, as noted by previous comments, I added a twelve ounce bag of frozen corn right before dropping in the dumplings. The recipe is great for making after a busy day at work. Thanks the VERY tasty recipe! p.s. I only added a pinch of cayenne and omitted the basil."
2001012651,530004,2017/4/2,4,"This recipe screams IMPROVISE. There are no instructions on how to prepare the ingredients so everyone's version is going to be different. We tried to stick to the amounts except in the seasoning. we improvised a bit and since we didn't have poultry seasoning we just added a bit of sage, tarragon, thyme, marjoram, and nutmeg. The chicken breasts were cut in half and browned and cooked as instructed. In the end, before serving I removed the dumplings,( which in the last minute, I flipped over as some were less cooked on top than others), I broke up the chicken into large chunks. This made it possible to eat with a spoon. The dumplings turned out perfect and the seasoning in them was delicious."
2001746637,530004,2017/10/9,5,Love the flavor of this...I need to make my dumpings larger as they pretty much have disappeared in the leftovers...but it still tastes very good. You must allow the prep time tho but a pot of chicken and dumplings from scratch to table in around an hour...totally wonderful.
2001049854,530004,2017/10/13,5,"I replaced the corn with 1/2 cup of frozen sweet peas &amp; omitted basil &amp; cayenne. I cooked my dumplings uncovered for 10 minutes, then added peas, closed &amp; locked kid &amp; simmered covered for an other 5 minutes. The result is lighter, fluffier dumplings that can gently be removed with slotted spoon, partially set aside while I stir in the heavy cream to warm before serving."
2001780056,530004,2017/11/5,0,"Okay.... how much corn and what about the cayenne powder, basil, etc.? The ingredient list does not seem to match the recipe. I mixed all the dry ingredients together to season the chicken and then a few of the ingredients were left off completely. I'll try tweaking myself... fingers crossed...."
2001919104,530004,2018/1/8,1,I wouldn't recommend
2001748853,530004,2018/1/27,5,I just made this and it is delicious! I mixed up the spices (I omitted the poultry seasoning!) and sprinkled them on the chicken and veggies. I saved the rest for the next pot I make. I added peas instead of corn. I also took out the cooked chicken and diced it up.
2001957460,530004,2018/1/27,0,"The instructions mention adding corn, except that there is no corn listed in the ingredients."
1803589934,530004,2018/2/7,4,I gave it a 4 because the flavor is very good. However there are few things problematic about this recipe. 1. There’s no mention of what to do with the chicken breasts after they cook and you of course have to either dice them or shred them or process them in some way. 2. Although the ingredients mention basil and Cayanne pepper I see nowhere in the instructions were you use it. 3 On the other hand the instructions mention corn but that is not in the ingredients list. And 4. I think eight minutes with a little short for getting those dumplings to firm up try something like 10 or 12 minutes
2001978425,530004,2018/2/7,3,"Hello everyone, Learning to be a stay at home Dad at 46?..The Insta Pot is Awesome! The recipe was quite hot, even for me. I would recommend ditching the cayenne or at least reducing to a pinch. I also used fresh thyme in the suggested quantity which overpowered all... I am quick to take the blame upon myself for not having done my usual thing when it comes to adding spices to slowly and gradually build them up to suit our taste..but on this occasion I followed the recipe to a T and after being served I found myself quickly removing everyone's helpings from the table shortly after the Cayenne started taking effect but not before witnessing some choice facial expressions from the wife and kids...lol 20 min. later we were having Wednesday pizza night on Tuesday!..Dad's 1st Insta Pot kitchen Flop made for some good fun and even extended our table time together..lol Wednesday's menu? Chicken Chili...Baha!! Smile...life is short. GB"
1399422,530004,2018/2/23,5,This is a new go-to recipe in our house. I got my Instant Pot for Christmas and I LOVE finding recipes my whole family loves. I tweaked the spices (particularly basil and cayenne) as they seemed a little heavy handed. This has excellent flavor and the parmesan is a delicious addition to the dumplings.
2002079772,530004,2018/3/27,3,"It was too spicy for me, no cayenne pepper next time. Not sure why this is even in this dish. A little too heavy on the other spices too, I would cut back on them as it overpowered the dish but without that I think it would be good, will modify if I use it again."
2002230153,530004,2018/7/26,2,"This recipe needs to be revised, it's only about half complete."
383346,501599,2013/8/5,5,My son didn&#039;t like this milk but I did.  I remember when I was a teenager and picking fresh blueberries.  Then I added blueberries in the blender with sugar.  It tastes almost the same.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for ZWT9
1226388,501599,2013/8/6,5,"It is at the beginning of our wild blueberry season in Alaska, and they were so good in this!  This reminded me of the flavored milk powder that comes in a can, but a million times better! I used regular 2% fat cows milk this time, but I&#039;ll bet this would be delicious with almond milk!  I would like to try the syrup on waffles too!"
228458,501599,2013/8/10,5,"I love this recipe! My kids are always asking for those flavored milk powders (where they got the idea I&#039;ll never know!), and I am always meanie mom for not being willing to buy them because they are (IMHO) full of yucky stuff. Imagine their excitement, then, when mom made them blueberry milk this morning! DD was especially excited since the milk turned out her favorite color (purple) :). Thanks so much for posting; I am excited to make this with other berries and finally be rid of the requests for the powder! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
1925885,501599,2013/9/5,5,"Oh, wow! They syrup is amazing and tasted great with almond milk.  I&#039;ll try it next time with regular milk, too.  I did decide to strain the solids out, which left a smooth and velvety syrup. Great for the drink, but I bet it would be awesome over some ice cream, too!  The leftover solids I ate by the spoonful, and would also make a great topping for ice cream, cheesecake, whatever!!!  Thanks for another great recipe, Sharon!  Made for ZWT9, for team Gourmet Goddesses."
1925885,532734,2017/7/24,5,"What a pretty and refreshing little spritzer! I had a bottle of Elderflower Liqueur that's been hanging around a bit too long in my cabinet, and this was a perfect use for it! Note: St Germain is pretty expensive. I used Fleur, by DeKuyper, which isn't nearly as good but is a much more reasonable alternative! Made for CQ4, Team Happy Campers."
1900993,495355,2013/3/2,4,As a lover of good cupcakes I give this one an honest review with the product being very tasty with the essence of bacon coming through very strongly in the finished cupcake with the sweet icing that adds some moisture to an otherwise dry cupcake.  I am glad I had a chance to make these for the Dining on a dollar contest 2013.
1706426,495355,2013/3/12,4,"A great idea, but needs tweaking. The frosting was too sweet, and the cupcakes were a touch dry. DH loved them though! Thanks for posting! Made for Dining on a Dollar"
574936,495355,2014/9/24,4,"I had been wanting to try these for a while now.  I omitted the cocoa, had none, and had to use a boxed white cake. I didn&#039;t realize it was vanilla flavored cake until all was mixed and I will not make that mistake again.  I enjoyed the flavor of the cakes (minus the vanilla flavor) and didn&#039;t have a problem with them being dry.  May be because I hate waste and I had a bit more applesauce in the fridge than what the recipe called for so I dumped it in.  There was one thing that wasn&#039;t too pleasing and that was the little chunks of bacon.  I chopped them quite small but they were still little hard pieces that you had to chew. That can be solved quite easily though.  Thank you so much for the recipe!"

2002198776,535371,2018/6/26,5,I was looking for a recipe to use blueberries and almond flour and found this one. The muffins were very good.
2001013499,535371,2018/8/10,0,These are delicious! I used dried blueberries instead because I had them. Great replacement! My husband will love these to take to work :)
2001047423,535653,2018/5/9,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed these with the accompaniments from the range to match (those listed in the ingredients list); the only thing I didn't have was Mexican Beer as I was in the UK, had to be German. I added a dish of mushrooms &amp; another of a peas/sweetcorn mix to have vegetables."

When I tell him there was grepefruit juice, he said that&#039;s why.  I thought he wouldn&#039;t notice it.  But we liked the taste a lot.  Me and DH drank it but we added rum.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for New Kids on the Block tag game"
135470,499512,2013/5/30,5,"This is a delicious spice rub! I Made it as written except for reducing the quantity and grinding coriander seed. I used it on shrimp, sprinkling it on generously then letting it sit for about 30 minutes. I saut&eacute;ed the shrimp in butter and olive oil, then after they were cooked removed the shrimp and added garlic, lemon juice and little more spice and butter, I cooked this down and pour it over the shrimp and served it with brown rice. The spice had lots of flavor and the coriander was very complimentary to the lemon juice.

I did substitute tomato paste as the small amount of sauce baffled me.  I also used canola oil instead of lard.  The recipe did catch my eye so I hope you continue posting recipes."
128473,518910,2015/7/8,5,"Wow, these sesame pork balls are wonderful, they had great flavor and excellent textures.  They were quick and easy to make with terrific results.

The directions are terse, suitable for someone who has made many pancakes and needs no direction.  I found the recipe online at http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0286/1113018.pdf and Mrs. Ford had included the usual directions I had expected.

I would definitely make this again, but with some tweaking for my tastes.  There wasn&#039;t near enough spice/oil mixture to evenly coat the mix, sometimes you get just plain cereal/pretzel/peanuts and then other times the mix is so strong in seasonings(cereals really absorb that mixture), it is overpowering.   But think with some changes, this could be a new favorite snack mix!!!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."

One of my favorite things to do with leftover cornbread is to eat it for breakfast, hot with butter and syrup, so I knew I was going to love this and I did!

Only change I made was to keep the bacon that made the drippings, chopped into very small pieces and combined into the corn meal mixture. Served with scrambled eggs, tabasco sauce and lots of love. I could also see this served with white sausage gravy on top as well. (ZWT 9)"

I don&#039;t know what I was worried about, it is truly yummy! I don&#039;t eat bacon so I used oil; I imagine that made my dish less savory. No matter, it still tasted great!

I didn't have raisin bread home so I used apple fritter bread. 2 slices of bread is too much for our appetite so I cut it down to one since the apple fritter bread is sliced a little thicker. I wish I had thought to throw some raisins in. Since I only used one bread I cut the milk down to 1/3 cup. I thought a Tbls brown sugar would be too sweet, so I just sprinkled some on top. I used a stick to mix it which just fit in the mug. I had a layer of egg custard at the bottom (I dumped it out of the mug because it was taking too long to cool."

I did not have chipolte on hand, so I left that out and since we do not like our food too spicy hot, I only used about 1/4 teaspoon of chile powder.  I also doubled the amount of rice.  I used leftover pork roast that I had for dinner the night before, but I am sure this would be just as delicious with chicken, which is what I usually have on hand.  I was so happy to find this recipe because I was going to throw it together based on a burrito recipe I ran across.

1701089,516363,2014/6/3,0,I&#039;m not putting any stars because I&#039;m only making a suggestion. You should always use pasteurized eggs anytime you&#039;re using them raw in a recipe. This will remove any chance of salmonella poisoning.
1802485984,513126,2014/2/13,5,"Delicious, easy to follow, quick and really cheap - I&#039;m a fan Mrs Wonder Savers"
1179225,513126,2014/11/27,4,"Very quick and easy. It seemed a little watery, I would use Greek yogurt next time. I topped it with some crushed red pepper and a little parmesan cheese. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
2206637,499422,2013/10/9,5,"Perfect, awesome, amazing, a &quot;10&quot;!!!!  I followed the recipe to a &quot;T&quot; (I had to use soy milk) down to using the 1/4 scoop for the batter.  These were perfect!  I was skeptical of the thick batter but you mentioned that so I went with it.... super glad I did!  I have honestly done at least 5 pancake recipes from this site and this is the BEST!!!!!"
583193,499422,2015/10/21,5,"Wow, these are light a fluffy!  Perfect pumpkin and spice ratio.  Yum!"

654393,496767,2013/3/16,5,One of my favorite dishes I first enjoyed at a local restaurant in New Orleans... Chicken Cordon Blue.  You have made this so easy to enjoy... I&#039;ll be making this one soon!
1802283507,496767,2014/5/5,5,This is one dish that my whole family loved. Their was very little left if any; even my picky kids had seconds. Thanks for putting this recipe up Joseel; now I have a go to dish that does not include the words mac and cheese on it. I have cooked for a lot of troops in my service in the Army and I would feel vary comfortably serving this recipe to them with no hesitation.
2000930139,496767,2016/4/2,1,I did not find this to be that good at all.
80353,504734,2013/7/31,5,"This really hit the spot on a VERY hot night.  Tart, not too sweet, lots of ice.  Good."
383346,504734,2013/8/5,5,This drink is so yummy.  But I added too much 7up.  I should have stop adding more after tasting it.  I&#039;ll be doing it again with just a touch of 7up.  Thanks Ck2plz :)  Made for ZWT9

2192609,497009,2013/3/11,5,An easy delicious chicken recipe for a simple weeknight supper is always welcome at my table...delicious!  Thank you
1359842,497009,2013/3/11,0,This is right up my alley.
2201427,497009,2013/3/22,5,Wow!!!  Awesome recipe!!  Great use of only 5 ingredients!
2000902398,497009,2018/1/14,4,"Turned out great! Baked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes on 375F ... 40minutes was way too short a time for a whole stuffed chicken breast to cook. Added garlic, spinach, red pepper and a combination of cheddar and parmesan for my stuffing. Would make this again as it was delicious and easy peasy!!"
1620171,503591,2013/8/2,5,"This was very tasty and simple. I only made enough for two serves and included a swede and some celeriac to the mix, they needed to be used. No other changes made. Made for ZWT 9 for the Tasty Testers."
542159,522836,2015/8/8,5,This salad is a hidden gem. I enjoyed the light tender flavors and textures. I left out the watercress because the store was out of watercress and made my own fresh tarragon vinegar using fresh tarragon (funny I could get fresh tarragon but not watercress). Sorry Jackie about the two changes but it turned out amazing and would be a perfect starter for any meal. Thanks so so very much for posting this great salad that we will be enjoying again.
37449,506206,2013/9/30,5,Very nice macaroni salad! I chopped the carrot in the food processor. I enjoyed the carrot and halved the recipe. Thanks! Made for My 3 Chefs event. :)
461834,503591,2013/9/5,5,"Loved these potatoes!!!  It was really a quick time in the oven (for an au gratin recipe) due to the potatoes and onions already being cooked, so it was a matter of baking all the ingredients together.  What was wonderful was the nice crunchy topping and then the tender and cheesy taters/onions underneath!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
305531,503591,2014/1/31,5,Yum! I used 2 humungous potatoes for these. I didn&#039;t boil them long enough because I was afraid that they would fall apart when it was time to slice them. I had to bake mine a little longer than directed - not the recipes fault. The flavor was wonderful and the whole family enjoyed them. Loved the onions and cheese (Mexi-cheese blend) in these. Thanks for sharing Studentchef. Made for Best of 2013 Tag.
37449,503591,2014/2/13,5,This came together nicely. I halved the recipe and used medium red potatotes. Thanks! Made for the Best of 2013 game.
165933,503591,2014/2/15,5,"We really enjoyed these potatoes.  DH went back for seconds!  I used sweet onions which sweetened the dish, next time I&#039;ll use regular onions.  Thanks."
128473,503591,2014/2/23,5,"These easy to make potatoes are delicious Studentchef.  We enjoyed them very much. The flavor from the cheese, sweet onions and yukon gold potates was perfect.  The tender texture was lovely, resulting in melt in your mouth potatoes.  I can&#039;t wait to make these again.  I made 1/2 a recipe, which was perfect for the two of us.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for Best of 2013 Tag Game."
865936,515573,2014/9/26,5,"This is a terrific and flavorful salad.  The tarragon really adds something fresh and delightful, and the peas, all 3 of them, add a nice crunch.  Thanks for posting."
2803801,494350,2014/1/12,5,"Delicious! Very easy and flavorful. I used a deer heart and deer burger instead of beef. I try to eat organ meats regularly because they&#039;re so healthy, but they can be difficult to eat. This is a nice recipe that makes the organ meat taste good. Thanks for posting!"
1191355,512728,2014/2/9,4,"Because of the health benefits, I am trying to learn to like avocados.  This isn&#039;t a bad mayo substitute.  I could taste the freshness of the lime.  Will make it again."
2001671896,534953,2018/1/30,0,Why can't I print the recipe?

2315822,493507,2013/6/18,5,I have made this a few times and love the ease of the recipe as well as the taste.
2001892579,526696,2017/12/26,5,Ok..I actually signed up just so I could leave this 5 star review! I worked at Houston's and one of the things I miss the most is our spinach dip and the Hawaiian Ribeye (yum!) this recipe is the closest I have ever come to making it! It's also absolutely AMAZING! We ate this most of the night and didn't even have room for dinner! I knew from working at Houston's that it was made with Romano cheese and chicken broth so MAKE THIS if you want an AWESOME spinach dip! SO good and easy to make! One pan and it's also great reheated! I would seriously give this 6 stars if it was possible. My new go-to pot luck item!
2002099486,526696,2018/4/6,5,This recipe is SOooo good! We made it three days in a row. Thanks for sharing it!
2002128163,526696,2018/4/24,5,I signed up just to review this as well. This is spot on to the Houston's Spinach and Artichoke dip. Great recipe and glad I tried it!
2002193696,526696,2018/6/21,5,"I have made this two or three times since the recipe was posted. We have a local restaurant that has had this on their menu for decades. I LOVE this stuff... I served it once at a family buffet style dinner and people were spooning it onto their plates and eating it. They thought it was a casserole. LOL. I serve it with salsa and sour cream, and tortilla chips. It truly is the most heavenly dip out there. If heaven has an appetizer? It is this dip. Thanks again for a tremendous recipe~!"
2001523205,526696,2018/10/18,0,Turned out well.
381180,494552,2013/2/9,5,"Nice tall loaf with a tender inside crumb, and a wonderful sweet flavor from the figs and honey.  The bread has a little crunch from the fig seeds and walnuts!  Will be great toasted for breakfast with cream cheese.  I increased the walnuts to 1/2 cup ~ Mixed on the dough cycle and baked in my oven, in Pyrex, at 350F for 30 minutes.  Tagged 02/03/13 for Photo Tag!"
2001592857,535104,2018/2/20,5,"Wow, who knew browned butter was for sweets AND savories. I've used it with plenty of entrees, but never a sweet treat. It gives the treat a depth I could not have predicted. I seriously was dubious of this, now I'm going to try browned butter in my Kellogg's Rice Krispy treats too."
126440,530091,2017/2/23,5,"Excellent Cookie. I chilled for a couple days in a roll, then thinly sliced to bake. Topped with the chocolate. They are so good but rich."
2000306631,520660,2015/8/21,4,Well worth the long prep time. Husband loved the dish!
137302,509758,2014/5/10,5,These cookies were delicious.  I was a bit concerned while making the balls because the dough seemed too crumbly.  However the resulting cookie was a perfect balance of moistness and tasted delicious.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.
2673385,493157,2013/2/2,0,I tried this and it did not go well.  It is a gooey thing and very sticky.  I was wondering if  anyone else had tried it.  Maybe it was just me
895132,503617,2013/7/16,5,"Perfect rice dish to accompany recipe #503018! I used brown long grain rice, and we could have just eaten it on itself without anything else. Thanks for posting!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Greece for The Apron String Travelers"
2000671010,499428,2015/11/12,5,I&#039;ve tried all the othe fry jacks recipe and this is by FAR the best one! Perfect measurements! I come back to this recipe time and time again
2002134181,499428,2018/4/29,5,"I made these this morning and boy did they turn out fantastic. I however added 2 tablespoons of shortening or Lard and made sure to mash it up nicely with the flour mix until there were only tiny flaky bits let. Fry Jacks has been a favourite of mine since I was a child but often when I made them, they did not turn out fluffy like these did. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe. Would upload more pics but it only allows me to post one."
157425,536678,2018/8/18,5,"I have always used boxed mac and cheese but after tasting this one no more boxes! Didnt use the cajun seasoning in the topping and sprinkled it in the macaroni a little at a time until it was perfect for us. Cheese sauce was easy to make, great tasting, and made a nice creamy macaroni and cheese.. Will also be a good cold weather dish. Made and reviewed for Susie D's World Tour."
531029,536678,2018/8/24,5,"Oh my was this delicious!!! I cannot wait to make this for my son who is the KING of Macaroni and Cheese! That topping makes the dish! If I changed anything, I might add a little more salt and pepper. Will make over and over again!!"
266635,536678,2018/8/25,5,"Yummy macaroni and cheese. : ) Made just as directed and we loved the panko bread crumbs and cheese on top. It turned out great and the crumb topping was so nice and crunchy. I'm shocked to be saying this, but I could have used more Cajun seasoning. : ) This mac &amp; cheese went really well with some crockpot creole chicken and steamed cauliflower with parmesan cheese. Made for SWT 2018 - Cajun/Creole."
305531,536678,2018/8/29,5,"Awesome! I made 1/2 of the recipe and stuffed myself silly. Easy and so good. Thanks for sharing, Nif."
461834,536678,2018/8/31,5,"I have been making homemade mac and cheese since I was about 12 yo and this is a yummy addition!! I made this as written, although only 1/2 of it. This was great for my lunch and wonderful as leftovers too!! Thanks for sharing the recipe, made for Susie's World Tour 2018."
126440,536678,2018/9/3,5,This is perfect. Both of us loved it and is now our go to for mac and cheese. Loved the spice and the crust. WOW! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe for Meatless Mon.
219942,504599,2013/8/5,4,"This is different than the cheesecake I&#039;m familiar with, but good in it&#039;s own way. I had a problem with the baking of it, though. It started to get too brown after just 1/2 hour, then I covered it with foil. But it was still getting way too brown around the edges even then, so for the last 15 minutes I turned it down to 375. The edges were too done, and I ended up cutting them off, but after that, served with Fresh Blueberry Sauce,  recipe #436240 , it was quite good. Perhaps a lower cooking temperature would change this outcome? It comes out pretty flat, so I piled 2 pieces together to serve. Also, I whirled the cottage cheese in the food processor to give it more of a smooth texture. (I admit this was to fool my grown daughter, who still doesn&#039;t like the texture of cottage cheese. Sneaky, huh?) Although I prefer a more traditional American-style cheesecake, this has the advantage of not being super sweet and so compliments a nice sweet fruit sauce really well!"
226867,504599,2013/8/30,5,"This was terrific!  I don&#039;t like regular cheesecake b/c it&#039;s sooo sweet (even though I like all the ingredients). When I saw that this included almonds, I was hooked. As another reviewer mentioned, this is not very sweet by itself. I served it with lingonberry/raspberry sauce. (By the way, I used finely ground almonds b/c I did not know what else to use!)&lt;br/&gt;made for ZWT9 Soup-a-Stars"
2002003720,504599,2018/2/21,1,This recipe is very disappointing. Swedish cheese cake is not made with cottage cheese. That's the theater's version and it doesn't come out very nice
679953,500618,2013/6/7,5,"These are knock your socks off burgers.  Starting what we enjoyed the most was the bacon.  Great falvors .. the coffee and the brown sugar was one of the best, even the bacon would be a great breakfast with some eggs.  The cole slaw was a hit too, though I omitted the sugar and salt.  With that being said the rest of the recipe was made as posted, Grilling time was 15minutes, and one of my neighbors kept asking what smelled so good, and what I was cooking.  Great burgers, and a heck of a treat.  Made for PRMR Tag."
2000737867,524967,2015/12/10,5,Can never go wrong with sun-dried tomatoes. They add a smoky distinctiveness that immediately gives recipes that wow factor. Great recipe!
2002211590,515743,2018/7/8,5,"Yes! This is great stuff, I'm absolutely addicted to it on my sandwiches."
2000739318,524967,2015/12/11,5,"The grilled balsamic chicken with pasta in a creamy sauce is an amazing combination with sun-dried tomatoes, arugula, feta, and pine nuts."
2002025448,534897,2018/3/2,5,"I've been making these on a keto diet as Taco shells. You place the cheese on a sheet of parchment, I just spread it out to about the size and shape I want (round) Sprinkle with cumin to give it that good taco taste. Then after you bake it till a golden brown color take it off the parchment with a large spatula and set it over a spoon handle or in a taco tray to form. I fill mine with shrimp browned with garlic and cumin and flavored with a squeeze of lime right before I fill the shells. If I were to make these every night no one would complain!"
2001911665,519074,2018/1/4,0,Used this manapua recipe on New Year's Eve and day. I found it easy to use and the dough came out perfectly and was easy to handle unlike a previous recipe I used. Only bump I experienced was dough rise time. I didn't see how long the rising would take until too late so had to make them next day. I would suggest moving those details to the top of your recipe instructions. Mahalo for the ono recipe!
2002143287,519074,2018/5/6,5,love this recipe so easy
323186,536318,2018/8/6,5,"Very good, thoroughly enjoyed for Susies World Tour, Argentina. you'll see I added kidney beans -- for some reason I thought they were supposed to be in there, apologies for that :) I like beans :) Thank you for a good recipe, with or without the beans :)"
280271,536318,2018/11/13,5,This chili was packed with a lot of different flavors...I used the whole 9 oz chorizo sausage...and because we enjoy heat...I used 3 red chili peppers...I knew the hubby wouldn't enjoy the chimichurri sauce...so I served it over rice with a side of sour cream to cut down the heat and a sprinkle of cilantro....along with some shredded cheddar cheese...delicious...made for FYC tag game...
128473,499460,2013/5/8,4,"What a lovely cobbler, it was delicious. Light, tender, fluffy with sweet berries and cream cheese.  Not overly sweet, I garnished with just a  little icing sugar to allow the cobbler to shine.  It was also wonderful served the next day with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for sharing this treat."
169430,514024,2014/4/14,5,Out Freaking Standing. Made this with bittersweet chocolate. I did the simmering and steeping parts while doing the dinner dishes and have been deeply enjoying it here at the computer. Not only is this a keeper it&#039;s going directly into my Favorites of 2014 book.  Thank you so much Nancy. Made for PAC. Spring 2014. :D
724631,499305,2014/4/10,2,"Apparently this recipe is for a 12-inch or larger cheesecake pan, as the batter could not fit in my standard 10-inch springform pan, and I cooked the extra 2 cups batter in a separate casserole dish (the much smaller size did not turn out well with this recipe&#039;s cooking method).  I had a 26cm Kaiser springform pan with glass bottom; per Cooks Illustrated, the Kaiser pan promotes over-browning, which I experienced.  I usually make (successfully) smaller cheesecakes in a pressure cooker, but I was successful when I used this same 26cm pan to make Recipe #244193 in the oven.  As for the taste: the cheesecake tasted okay to me; DH said he would be delighted to eat the rest of the cheesecake and was ready to give 5 stars.  The sauce can cover any cracks in the cheesecake, but there was a bit too much lemon in it to suit me (and I love lemon!).  Because it is off-season, my strawberries weren&#039;t great, even though I trimmed them down to only the juicy red parts.  On the plus side, I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, and that was perfect.  All in all, I don&#039;t think I will try this baking method for cheesecake again, as it was a very large time investment before a disappointing unveiling.  I&#039;d rather learn earlier that I should start over for serving company.  It&#039;s nice that DH welcomed the opportunity to polish it off, so this was not a total failure.  Made for Spring 2014 Pick A Chef."
37449,493328,2013/8/5,5,I scaled this down for one. Great sandwich!  Love Scandinavian food! Made for ZWT 2013. What  a great way to explore the food of the world :)
2324285,508706,2013/11/7,4,"Pretty good.  The sausage provides most of the flavor in this dish, although I really enjoyed the little bursts of flavor from the tomatoes.  Instead of using parsley, I mixed in some fresh basil."
163112,514024,2014/8/20,4,Absolutely delicious.  I *would* cut back a bit on the orange zest because it overpowered the other flavors.  I used 70% cacao bittersweet chocolate which was PERFECT.  I think I&#039;ll make this over&#039;n&#039;over&#039;n&#039;over....  Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ.  Thank you!
895132,514024,2014/8/23,5,"With Elmotoos hint I cut back the orange zest a bit, and it was perfect! I used 80 percent dark chocolate, and that matched exactly my preferences, soo good! Thanks for sharing :)"
128473,514024,2014/9/17,5,"Oh Yum, I&#039;ve been eyeing this recipe all tour and now I have finally made it.  It was well worth the wait.  What a terrific hot chocolate this was.  So quick and easy to make, with a delicious flavor and a beautiful silky smooth texture.  Wow, I love that you can taste all the spices, the orange and the rum. Did I say that this is probably the best hot chocolate that I have ever tried.   Thank you so much my friend, for sharing a recipe that I will enjoy often this winter.  Made for Culinary Quest - 2014 - Family Picks - Suitcase Gourmets."
227978,514024,2014/12/12,5,"This was super delicious.  The combination of spices adds such an exquisite taste to this hot chocolate drink, and it had such a smooth, creamy texture.  The hint of the anise and touch of cinnamon is what made this so wonderful. It was a great drink to sip on, and I know we&#039;ll have this often.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Nancy&#039;s Pantry.  Made for the &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; tag game."
1925885,514024,2015/2/8,5,"Simply delicious!  I admit to having imbibed the first glass without straining the drink first, and it was a little grainy. But the second, strained serving - OMG! I thought the zest was spot on. I did have to increase the chocolate a bit, but that was personal preference.  It&#039;s been raining all day here, a bit odd for our summer, and this chocolate definitely hit the spot! Made for Best of 2014. Thanks for posting!"
1680722,514024,2015/3/23,5,"This was our delicious good night drink today!&lt;br/&gt;I preapred this with the listed spices and for the orange zest I used self made oranged from Greek oranges (I mashed this in the mortar prior use). After boiling I removed the spices, sieved (pressed the mushed orange zest through the sieve) and added half quantity of the suggested rum.&lt;br/&gt;The taste was similar to the taste of some &quot;Lebkuchen&quot; (gingerbread without ginger). For a children version there is the possibility to sustitute real rum with rum-flavor.&lt;br/&gt;Made for Culinary Quest 2014.

Made this again on 2015 for Beverage Anyone? Tag Game. The taste of zest and anise! Highly recommended!"
2000591556,514024,2015/10/26,5,"Ok, well I haven&#039;t tried it yet and I want to make this for a spanish project and I want to add the funnel cake looking thing in the back of the picture. Can someone please tell me what it is and how to make it?"
4740,500256,2015/8/25,2,I like all of the ingredients but somehow this had a weird flavor.
239758,527654,2016/8/6,5,"A delicious and easy-to-make Thai red curry. To make it go a bit further, I added a small bunch of broccoli florets and several sliced mushrooms. I'll keep this as a go-to recipe for busy nights, but I will cut the salt in half. Both the fish sauce and red curry paste have a good hit of salt, so a whole teaspoon of extra is not really necessary. Thanks for posting. Made for the Culinary Quest 2016."
227978,527654,2016/8/11,5,"This was delicious, sheepdoc. I served it over plain white rice, and the red curry paste really livened up the rice. It goes together quite quickly too, so this would be a great choice for a busy night when you don't have a lot of time to fuss in the kitchen but you still want a full, tasty meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 (Thailand)."
37449,495287,2013/3/1,4,This was nice. It tasted pretty much like thousand island dressing to me and I dipped romaine lettuce into it.  I used the rest of it on a sandwich.  I enjoyed it. Good luck!
128473,495287,2013/3/2,4,"We enjoyed this tasty dip, it was tangy and had a lot of flavor.  It made a really nice lunch served with Naan bread, cornchip scoopables, yellow pepper, cucumber slices and thick slices of carrotes.  We enjoyed the carrot the best with the dip. It was a nice use of contest ingredients, good luck in the contest."
461834,503558,2014/6/14,5,"What a wonderful waffle.  I love lemon flavor so this was right up my alley!!  I made 1/4 of the recipe, using just 1 egg, and it worked out perfectly for one serving.  It has a nice subtle lemon flavor.  I added some butter and sprinkled on some powdered sugar for a great morning treat.  Thanks for sharing the recipe BK.  Made for PRMR tag game."
482376,503558,2017/8/25,5,Yummy wa1ffles! I made them as directed and they turned out beautifully. I loved the hint of lemon! Thank you
92006,503558,2017/8/26,5,"These were great! I loved the lemon flavor, very different from the usual vanilla waffles. I only wish I had a better, more authentic waffle iron instead of my electric Elmo one! Thanks! Made for CQ '17"
131126,503558,2017/9/3,5,I made half a recipe and wish I had made more! I liked the strong hint of lemon and the texture was fluffy. I sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar or spread with strawberry thyme butter. Both were good! Thank you for sharing the recipe!
135470,503558,2017/9/4,5,Great waffles! the lemon was light but present. i served them with whipped cream and lingon berry jam which brought out the lemon. I made a half recipe which made not quite 8 squares on a traditional 4 square waffle maker. Made for CQ4
558429,499004,2013/6/25,5,"These muffins are moist and delicious. I used half white and half whole wheat flour. I also substituted flaxseed for wheat germ and replaced the ricotta cheese and canola oil with 1 cup of applesauce. I was able to get six muffins out of my Texas-sized muffin cups. Baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I&#039;m always on the lookout for healthy baked goods recipes and this one will certainly be made again. Thanks for posting, Mikekey!"
169430,513565,2014/5/23,5,Lovely change of pace dish. I used half the ask for amount of Splenda for Brown the sugar and used tomato paste in place of the ketchup and we really liked the result. It still had very good flavor and we enjoyed the beef and chickpeas together. I served it with garlic rice and a green salad.
2688819,495536,2013/2/18,5,"This sound really good, quick and easy. I want to try it soon."
1925885,536060,2018/7/18,5,"Excellent! I made this on the spur of the moment, when DH made plans and I was left alone for dinner! :-( I love that frozen Ahi fillets are parasite free and make for great poke! Followed exactly except I halved the recipe but kept the soy/sesame oil amount as written due to personal taste. So good! Thanks for posting! Made for Susies World Tour 2018, team Incredibles."
204024,512142,2014/4/7,5,Easy and flavorful.  I used recipe#347977 for the BBQ rub.  This is a great way to make pulled pork.  2 cups of water covered the meat nicely.  Made for PAC Spring 2014.

865936,502901,2013/8/22,4,"This came out really good!  The more i ate it, the more I liked it. I did forgrt the tomatoes, but they would have been lovely and sweet, since I have roasted them before. I made them into individual little casseroles using ramekins."
2002160188,533781,2018/5/21,0,I did not see the carb count for this recipe. Did I miss it? It's important to those of us on Keto.

266635,498608,2013/6/6,5,"We really enjoyed this quinoa salad.  Such great textures and flavors and so healthy for you too.  The arugula is so delicious and a great addition with it&#039;s peppery bite to it.  Will definitely make this salad again -- can&#039;t wait to make it for dinner guests.  Made for PRMR, June, 2013."
2689184,496766,2013/3/7,5,"What a great appetizer!  So easy to make, too."
169430,510958,2013/12/31,4,"Unbelievably, I found that this needed an addition of Splenda to really bring out the flavors. I think I&#039;d skip the honey in the future as, for me, the honey taste didn&#039;t justify the 74% sugar. I only use Adams peanut butter and it has no sugar and I didn&#039;t have any almond milk on hand so used 2% dairy milk. The peanut butter taste is subtle but there. Thanks for offering your recipe Sharon, I enjoyed trying it. :D"
80353,502864,2013/8/26,5,I love most Asian ways with eggplant.  This one is delicious and very easy.
198154,518483,2014/10/13,4,"I made this for dinner tonight. Everyone in my family gave this 4 or 5 stars. It was a little spicy for some but that was the only complaint.  Pretty good, considering it isn&#039;t often we all agree on something. Thanks for a great meal!"
37449,502864,2013/8/20,5,This made a nice lunch today with Laotian rice. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 2013 by a member of Hot Stuff.
1802632995,514793,2014/3/31,5,Oh Wow! These are delicious. I&#039;ve made similar versions with sausage and chicken before but never thought of using potato. Great idea. Yummy!
1802640314,514793,2014/4/3,5,Perfect food for party!
1802647672,514793,2014/4/6,0,Great recipe! Delicious and easy to make.
2001898040,504636,2017/12/29,0,"The recipe calls for 2 tbsp sugar, but the ingredients lists 2 tbsp honey. Which is it?"
526411,498540,2017/2/28,5,The recipe is awesome. I didn't use bay leaves and I had to use dried thyme. Next time I'll be sure to have fresh. We all enjoyed it very much. Thanks so much for posting this.
2001808278,533434,2017/11/20,5,"Very delicious when tried with jalape&ntilde;o cheese cubs made into the sausage , I cut out the spices in mine and added a little crab boil mix to it ...turned out fantastic!"
2000304552,522608,2015/7/6,5,This bbq recipe did well for my husband and I. We found smoking wood at http://growokc.com and everything combined well. We did this recipe 4th of July. Awesome!
2000685984,522608,2015/11/17,5,"I saw this &quot;Crock Pot Dump Meals&quot; lady on late night TV commercials, and the root beer pulled pork looked really good, so I bought a pork butt roast from my local grocer, telling the butcher exactly what I was going to do with it. He was the one who recommended the pork butt roast. He said it was perfect for pulled pork. Well... it was indeed perfect! I can honestly say that I have cooked pulled pork that was better than any restaurant pulled pork I have ever eaten. I put it in the crock pot on low and cooked it all day while I was working. When I got home, the house smelled wonderful, and it was so delicious!"
2388936,504062,2013/7/17,5,This is my new favorite chicken dish!! I had it two days in a row and it will be a staple dish at our gatherings!!
1677099,500849,2013/8/29,5,I love that this dough is made with a significant protein component.  I had to add a bit more yogurt for that amount of flour to get a good texture.  It was great for a thin and crispy crust pizza.  I am not too sure about other applications.  Next day addition.....This recipe is GREAT for tortillas!!!  They have a &quot;bite&quot; or tooth to them and great flavor.
1800159860,499217,2014/3/21,0,Thank you! I skipped the cilantro because I didn&#039;t have any at home today and they turned out great! Next time I&#039;ll try with it
6651,499217,2014/5/10,4,"We enjoyed these savory muffins.  They reminded me a bit of cornbread muffins, and were a nice addition to breakfast.  The bacon, cilantro, and cheddar make for a colorful muffin.  I thought they needed a little something, so we tried a dab of butter and then also tried a drizzle of maple syrup -- yum!"
343262,504521,2013/10/16,5,"This one is a keeper, only change I made was in using sugar free maple syrup. I&#039;m going to experiment with adding grated apple or canned pumpkin to the oatmeal mixture. Made ahead it&#039;s a quick breakfast for the next morning. Thanks for posting !"
242766,504521,2014/5/4,5,"We loved this baked oatmeal! It&#039;s quick and easy to assemble, so it&#039;s perfect when you need to get breakfast on the table in a hurry. I used old-fashions oats instead of quick cooking, and pecans instead of walnuts. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper! **Made for 2014 Spring PAC**"
2002273749,534393,2018/9/13,0,"What ingredients make this receipe, braised cauliflower with tomatoes, have so many carbs"
2002266552,506813,2018/9/4,4,"Really good. Low carb. Only change, use chicken thighs, boneless, instead of breasts. Breasts dry out too much. This can be served with hot sauce. If not doing low carb, red beans, rice and biscuits. Mush it all up together, yum."
8144688,509978,2014/3/16,5,"I made them using half flour and half whole wheat flour,  white chocolate pudding mix and chocolate chips. I also use turbinado sugar that I have on hand instead of light brown sugar, giving them little crunch. First time I made them and came out perfect. I left some to brown a few minutes longer and came crispier and golden. Either way my family loved them. Easy to do and perfect drop up cookies."
2001330613,507372,2017/11/1,4,"I used this recipie as a base, so it may not be fair to write a review. I omitted the spinach because I didn’t have any. Instead of vegetarian, I added ground beef and rice. The seasoning transferred well to the adjusted ingredients."
2399085,506531,2013/9/8,5,Very good. Made for PRMR. It was very tasty. I love onions. I used 2% milk with this as buttermilk isn&#039;t my favorite. Great and tasty. Thanks fir the recipe!
203325,506531,2013/11/22,5,"I would give this recipe 10,20, 30 stars if I could!  They taste like onion rings from our favorite local jazz bar.    The thinner you cut the onions, the better they are."
560491,506531,2014/5/16,5,OMG going straight into my Best of 2014 Cookbook!!  So good and addicting!  I used regular milk but otherwise made as written.  Next time I will have to double or triple the recipe!!  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
2001441146,506531,2017/9/28,5,"These are fantastic! I've been eating these for years @Jim's Frontier in San Antonio TX....substituting regular milk for buttermilk makes no difference in the recipe, but if you do not like buttermilk, use soured milk. In 99% if any recipe...you never taste the buttermilk! p.s. they may be a lil greasy, but thats part of the great taste (somethings need a lil grease)."
2002029112,504648,2018/3/4,0,I found it a bit bland
67728,512684,2014/5/16,3,"Unfortunately, this was not a winner for us. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, because if DH and I go to KFC, that is what we order. Because of this, I was really only judging this on the coating and seasoning. I had to leave out the chives, because I didn&#039;t have any. I knew that I would have to adjust the cooking time significantly because of the cut of chicken I was using, so that wasn&#039;t a problem. My issues were with the seasoning and coating. Maybe if I didn&#039;t have the KFC flavor in mind when I was making this, I would&#039;ve been happier with it. Even with all the herbs and spices in the coating, this chicken was very bland. It smelled great when cooking, but didn&#039;t taste like it had seasoning at all. The coating was also nothing like KFC&#039;s. I&#039;m wondering if KFC&#039;s actual coating is in a batter form, rather than an egg-to-flour dip. I think this would&#039;ve been vastly improved with the addition of brined chicken and some more salt or some Spike seasoning in the coating. It&#039;s not that this was inedible or anything -- I&#039;ll be using this in some chicken sandwiches. I was just really hoping that this would recreate that KFC flavor, but it completely missed the mark in that arena, and that is what I am rating. So sorry that I couldn&#039;t rate this better, but thanks for posting. Made for PAC Spring 2014"
2002283320,536098,2018/9/24,4,"Good recipe, I personally enjoy adding onion powder and garlic cloves"
354135,510964,2017/2/13,5,The only thing I did wrong when making this soup was when I tried setting the timer the crockpot was plugged into.....I'll have to find the directions yet again. It was done by the time I got home and I had a bowl right away. The only alteration was the serving size since it was just for me. Other than that it was very luxurious to come home and have dinner ready. I know someone else who will like this so I will definitely be making it again and in a larger amount.
2002172385,534509,2018/6/2,5,"awesome creamy mac n cheese! I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower, but couldn't even taste it in this dish."
386585,504473,2013/10/7,5,"Now, first of all, I must state that I do not have a pressure canner, or canning equipment of any kind.  However, this recipe really appealed to me, so I had to make it anyway!  I did the overnight soak method for the beans, as directed.  My chorizo did not crumble well at all, so I had to chop it into small pieces.  I followed the recipe as directed, adding heavy cream at the end.  This is such a rich, satisfying soup that is packed with flavor.  I did end up freezing some of it, and I&#039;m looking forward to enjoying this again soon.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for My 3 Chefs 2013."
80353,502992,2013/8/21,5,This is good stuff!  I used dried bird&#039;s eye chilis.  Used this in Recipe #505779 and it was the bomb!
480195,502992,2013/8/25,5,Wow! This really packs a flavor punch to whatever you use it with. I had only used jarred harissa in the past and there is no comparison to the flavor in your recipe. Thanks for sharing it. I will use it from now on.
2188562,495180,2013/2/12,5,"WOW! I'm not one for recipes that use mixes and what not, but this was darn good. The ranch worked very very very well with the scallops and even better with the spinach. I was impressed. Easily could have served three people, but it was so good I ate more than I should have."
2692217,495180,2013/2/13,5,All the flavors of this dish mingle to perfection. All of my favorite ! Love that it is easy and quick as well as a very pretty dish. I might try some thinly sliced garlic toast on the side next time.
146742,507569,2013/10/8,4,"I love Philly-Cheese Steak sandwiches, and I made this same recipe a while back.  I made it as written the first time, and it was really good.  However, the 2nd time I made it, I mixed the sauce in with the hamburg filling, it was lot less messy than putting dollops of the cheese sauce on top. It is very tasty and different."
251626,507569,2013/10/14,4,"Everyone in the house liked these. I wasn&#039;t crazy about the sauce, but I thought that the taste alone was good."
369715,507569,2013/10/24,3,This was different for us. I followed the recipe except when I went to add the Worcestershire sauce I put more in then a drizzle. I actually like it though with more Worcestershire sauce. My family didn&#039;t think it had enough flavor though. What I had left I froze and will see if the flavors draw through more.
1803732755,507569,2015/2/1,0,Made this for my very picky husband and he and my son loved it!! I didn&#039;t have provolone so I substituted mozzarella and it was great! You must try this one!!
2855938,495027,2013/6/8,5,"Tastes amazing! Some reviews complain about being too much work, but it is easy, just a little time consuming. The good thing is it does not require a lot of babysitting. Almost exactly like TGIFriday&#039;s, but a little spicier. I doubled the recipe so it will last longer and it worked out really well. I highly recommend this sauce/glaze!"
1802519848,495027,2014/3/24,5,Really good interpretation! Thanks for posting.
2869623,495027,2014/6/17,0,"This is it!  Look no further for a copycat recipe! True, this is a little time consuming, but so worth it, IMO.  I also like to double it and use it on grilled chicken and shrimp! I  like to make it a day ahead of time so the flavors blend together and let the sauce thicken up a bit.  I discovered that it tastes the same whether or not you use the real JD&#039;s (I have made it both ways), in case you don&#039;t want to spend the $ on the real stuff...of course, then it&#039;s not JACK DANIELS sauce, but whatever :)"
1803683827,495027,2015/1/20,5,Almost perfect. I cut the pineapple ingredients in half and was perfect. Taste just like TGI!
2000175674,495027,2015/4/30,5,"This recipe is amazing and is incredibly close to what they serve at TGI Fridays. It is good on EVERYTHING!! A couple of tweaks I made - double the amount of Jack Daniels, double the amount of crushed pineapple, and definitely cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half. Be sure to allow time for the sauce to reduce or it will be runny. Reducing also intensifies the flavor. Amazing recipe!!!"
155902,495027,2015/5/10,5,Tastes just like it! The texture felt a little off with the crushed pineapple. Maybe I just didn&#039;t notice the pineapple in the sauce before? It&#039;s still delicious!
2000202154,495027,2015/5/13,3,Sounds yummy
2000647990,495027,2015/11/7,5,Excellent best version Ive tried spot on
2001090260,495027,2016/7/16,0,Unbelievable awesome..but does anyone have the same problem it takes more then 50 min my sauce Took about 2 hrs any suggestions
844554,511793,2014/5/9,5,This turned out great for us! We don&#039;t eat alot of chickpeas so this was a wonderful way to get them in our diet. I used edamame instead of green peas. Made for PAC Spring 2014.
2597942,499485,2013/10/7,5,"Well this was a wonderful, warm lunch today (it only reached 59* here). Very filling for a soup. I only had Russet potatoes, but I cubed them and it worked just fine. I used regular chicken broth (not low-sodium) so I skipped the salt. I had left over ham, so I cubed that. The kicker was the sour cream. Nice, velvety texture. I actually added a dollop more to my individual bowl. I even thought about sprinkling some shredded cheese over the top (maybe tonight). The crispy bacon really adds to the texture and flavor. Hubby isn&#039;t home yet to try it, and he doesn&#039;t get here soon, there may not be any left! Thank you for posting a very nice soup recipe. (Made for &quot;My 3 Chefs&quot;)"
1745502,522871,2015/7/31,4,"I loved this. The wasabi was not overpowering and blended in well with the other ingredients. You can cook the broccoli your favorite way to make this dish (microwave, etc.) DH thought it was too bitter. I think he&#039;s wrong."
895132,522871,2015/7/31,4,"This was a lovely dish, we really liked it. It would be five stars if the wasabi flavour was stronger, I&#039;ll make it definitely again and use more wasabi :)
Thanks for sharing!
Made for Culinary Quest 2015 / Japan"
1925885,522871,2015/8/5,4,"We liked this unusual broccoli dish, but like other reviewers found the wasabi a little too weak. Once the broccoli was cooked and slightly cooled, I put it in a lidded container and poured the sauce over it. Every once in a while, I would shake it a little to distribute the sauce. We did serve it at room temperature. We&#039;ll definitely make it again, but will increase the wasabi to our taste. Thanks for posting! Made for Culinary Quest 2015 by a Toasted Tourist."
305531,522871,2015/8/26,4,"I really enjoyed this dish. Like others, I thought the wasabi flavor was somewhat weak, so I served some wasabi on the side as well. Thanks, Linda for sharing. Made for Culinary Quest 2."
482376,522871,2016/7/21,4,This was a great broccoli recipe. I thought it had the right amount of wasabi. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut down on the amount of sauce. This broccoli would be a great addition to any Japanese meal! Thank you.
1052873,522871,2016/7/24,5,"So, I made this with cauliflower instead of broccoli because I had some cauliflower that needed to be eaten. Very tasty, slightly asian flavor. Not very hot. I put all the wasabi in the sauce; probably should have saved some for on the side."
900992,502327,2013/7/16,5,"This is really good and it gave me an opportunity to prune back a lot of my herb plants which were getting a little leggy. We doubled the sauce and we are going to have the leftovers on swordfish tomorrow. When we make it next time, we will reduce the amount of lemon flavor a bit. As it stands, it&#039;s a very prominent flavor and I&#039;d like it to be a little less &quot;in your face.&quot; Thanks for posting."
338870,515888,2015/11/22,5,"My husband loved this recipe! We used Xylitol as the sweetener and it was a little grainy. Next time I will melt the Xylitol grains in some butter previous to mixing it in. It&#039;s all about the sugar substitute used! Otherwise, great recipe!"
2001149134,515888,2016/8/31,5,Thank you for the excellent recipe!! I left out the vanilla (I don't care for the raw alcohol) then blended it all in a food processor until it was smooth as silk! Delicious!!
2001840905,515888,2017/12/5,0,"After I added all the dry ingredients, oil separated from rest of the mixture! It's in the refrigerator now but I imagine it will just cool with a layer of oil on top? Any ideas what went wrong?"
2123645,515888,2018/3/12,3,"This fudge is OK. More like peanut butter cheesecake than fudge. I had a difficult time getting the cream cheese to stir into the mixture. It was very clumpy, so I ended up putting the mixture in the food processor. I think it might work better to blend the peanut butter and (softened) cream cheese together first before melting with the butter."
2399085,513145,2014/2/18,5,Made for PRMR! very GOOD. This recipe is very similar to my grandmothers recipe from years ago. Really brings back fond memories!!!! Thanks
2000275579,513145,2015/6/17,5,This is my favorite cookie recipe.  Instead of the second cup of chocolate chips and the peanut butter chips  I use dark chocolate peanut butter cups.  I have put one in the middle of each cookie and baked them or chopped them and mixed them into the batter.  Either way works great!  I also use toasted pecans.  The cookies are amazing and have gotten rave reviews!
2001930849,521532,2018/1/14,5,Hi I tried the recipe yesterday and it turned out right. I just have a bit of issue on achieving the right color. I put a bit of blue gel coloring and at first it was just right blue I wanted but as it sets it turned to a bit of greenish instead of blue. What do you think is the reason why it turned like this?
305531,507873,2017/11/29,5,I made these for my family for a Thanksgiving breakfast and they were a real hit. Simple to make and tasted great. Thanks for sharing.
2000431985,521532,2018/6/23,0,"Why would you put in 2 cups of water? In order for the mixture to get to 300&deg;F, its going to have to cook the water away first. I've only started playing around with brittles, caramels, and other candies in the last year. So I'm no expert but I would think at most a half a cup of water should be more than enough."
2001902080,493661,2017/12/31,5,I have make this pie using this recipe several times. My husbands favorite. See my post under tweaks for a slight modification I used.
242602,507349,2013/12/22,3,This was simple to make. I cubed the apples instead of sliced them. It was more of a porridge consistancy but that may be how all of the crock pot oatmeals are? This is the first time making it. I would make it again though. It has good flavor and I feel full after one bowl.
2734642,495880,2013/3/13,5,Nice twist! very good
2734648,495880,2013/3/13,4,Interesting concept. wasn't too bad.
2001113368,500370,2016/8/3,5,"AMAZING!!! I love this recipe! I was looking for this recipe, and here it is! THX!!!"
239758,503081,2014/1/29,5,"Fantastic rolls that we&#039;ve enjoyed twice today. Great for BLTs at lunch and then perfect for burgers at dinner. I made as written. My scales show increments of 5 grams, so my finished dough weighed in at 1020 grams, giving me 12 rolls of 85 grams each. I used a floured wooden spoon handle to make the impression in each roll, and could have pressed a little to get the same result shown in your pic. Forgot to dust with flour and could have baked just a tad longer than recommended, but my oven has been a little iffy lately so that is most likely the reason. Love the onion is these and look forward to making them again soon."

169430,502020,2013/6/24,5,"Oh wow, what a hit this is! I used it as a side for garlic steak with steamed broccoli for an amazing dinner tonight. Love, love the mushrooms! used cremini&#039;s and could have eaten every mushroom in the package done this way. The seasoning was dead on, well flavored but not over powering. Thanks Mike for another marvelous recipe."
573772,519541,2015/7/5,5,Yum! This is very tasty. I grated dark chocolate on top.
2000590547,520642,2015/10/22,5,"Life changing! Can&#039;t stop eating! Make this recipe, do not move on. You just found dinner! My kids wanted a potato soup and I wanted a cream of potato VEGAN! It is AMAZING!! I did not have bullion so instead I substituted 1 tlbs. of sea salt, 1 tlbs. Italian seasonings into the cashew/nutritional yeast mixture. My husband had 5 bowls, my kids said I needed to make it once a week! It was fairly easy prep, especially if you get someone else to peel your potatoes! Thank you soooo much for sharing. I&#039;m curious now about using this soup base for any creamy soup, like mushroom or asparagus. Mmmmmmm mmmmmm DELICIOUS!!!"
169430,509244,2014/3/25,5,Loved the flavor! I used fresh homemade lemonade in place of the commercial as it contains too much sugar for a diabetic and I used Splenda to make it. Very easy and something to keep in the fridge during the warmer weather.
724631,509244,2014/5/1,5,"The perfect balance of sugar and tea, not overly sweet.  Made 1/3 recipe (5 1/3 cups) for us to test this recipe.  This would be great for an outdoors gathering.  Thank you for sharing!  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
724631,500140,2013/7/24,5,"What a treat!  This is a new taste sensation for us, and we loved it!  None of the Asian noodles at Wegman&#039;s said &quot;ramen&quot;, so I opted for rice sticks.  Following the cooking directions for rice sticks, I soaked them 15 minutes, drained them, and then added them when I added the sauce and cooked for 5 minutes; rice noodles soak up whatever sauce they are in, and I was impressed with the result.  DH was happy that the lemon did not overpower.  DH had found my secret stash of peanuts, so I substituted diced walnuts.  I would consider the bean sprouts as optional.  As for portions, this makes 4 servings for hungry people.  Thank you for sharing, RP.  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
2001329932,500140,2017/2/12,4,This noodle dish is made instead of rice noodles and mixed with lemons to give it a sweet zest to any dish.
227978,505013,2014/4/17,5,"This was delicious, ninyai.  I made it in a small bowl instead of a mug so that I would have a slightly larger dessert that I could share with my son.  We both enjoyed this a lot.  I&#039;ll definitely keep this on hand for those mornings when I want something sweet for breakfast but don&#039;t want a whole dessert lying tempting me to take 2nd and 3rd servings.  Made for the Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef event."
383346,503302,2013/8/22,4,This was a good marinade.  The pork was in it overnight.  Maybe I would have liked it with more sweetness.  Somehow I&#039;m not sure I like the taste of fish sauce ;)  Thanks Mikekey :)  Made for ZWT9
560491,503302,2013/8/26,5,Great marinade!  I poured this over chicken skewers and marinated it overnight and then grilled them.  Since they marinated so long they grilled up quickly and were tender and juicy. Made for ZWT9.
461834,503302,2013/8/26,5,"I loved this marinade!!!  It was very easy to put together, made it in the morning and marinaded a rib eye steak all day til dinner time.  I noticed another reviewer stated it wasn&#039;t sweet enough, for me, it was perfectly sweetened from both the honey and the sugar.  The only change I made was to scale the recipe back, making 1/3 of it as it was just me for dinner last night.  I was grilling and running back and forth to kitchen (cooking side dishes) and due to the sugar/honey, it really caramelized the one side (pretty charred) so you really need to be close and keep a close eye on your grill.  Thanks for sharing a great marinade, can see using it on chicken or pork as well!!  Made for ZWT 9."
2001655669,533590,2018/10/31,5,"thanks for posting this but this should be on youtube or something... this is stunning, you are a real artist. I would never make this myself but honestly this was a good read and something to go along with this pack of oreos... so stunning I would have to pay you for something like this . Thanks for sharing"
461834,503994,2016/8/2,5,"Yummy and oh so easy to make!!! I made this as written although scaled back for 1 banana and I made part with the sesame seeds and some without. I tried the ones with sesame seeds with a bit of maple syrup and the others I topped with some chocolate syrup and whipped cream. I think when using the sesame seeds, it was more of a savory flavor (kind of nutty) and can see actually doing this method with some onion rings or zucchini coins!! I really loved the ones that I fried the longest, wonderfully crunchy but yet somehow still light, so good!! Can't wait to make more of these wonderful treats!! Made for Culinary Quest 2016."
2698016,495128,2013/2/17,5,Shrimp and quiche are two of my favorites. Very good!
2000936956,535315,2018/4/25,0,Sounds delicious but definitely not Keto. You are an amazing chef and I wish you can make some keto recipes for your keto followers as well as put the serving sizes down in the recipes.
337963,531119,2017/4/15,5,"LOVE THESE! My sister got me hooked on these, they are sooooo much better than storebought! Crazy good and crazy easy to make. I like to leave them in little balls in a tupperware in the fridge, then roll them out as needed."

1803568177,511752,2015/9/7,5,this was amazing. I had zero expectations because I had failed at my last cauliflower recipe but this blew my mind. I did add more Cajun seasoning because I am a spice freak. I was literally saying &quot;yum&quot; after each bite.
2002144670,511752,2018/5/7,0,How much milk in cup measurements is 50 ml?
169430,494433,2013/2/24,5,I made this syrup this morning replacing the sugar with Splenda and used it with brewed Darjeeling. What a lovely tea it made and I especially like that that by doing it this way you can have have as much or little of the added flavor as you wish.
865936,503403,2016/8/9,5,"This dipping sauce is so good. It is spicy hot, but has depth of flavor. I used it with chicken."

2000213602,507199,2015/5/20,5,I made this tonight for my husband&#039;s birthday.  OH...MY...GOODNESS....talk about yummy!!! I could only eat half of mine but hubby are all of his. We started eating before I could take a picture so I&#039;m uploading my half-eaten serving.  I love how easy it is to make.  I served it with raspberries and vanilla frozen yogurt.  Thanks for sharing!
2924571,498803,2013/7/31,5,"These are very tasty, and accurately described as &quot;ooey-gooey.&quot; I started making these at night and due to poor time management ran out of time. After forming the rolls, I covered them and put them in the fridge instead of letting them rise. Eight hours later when I awoke they were risen and ready to go. They did need to cook longer than stated but that could have been due to the refrigeration. Overall I was very happy with this recipe and will be writing it down for my recipe box."
1802667201,498803,2014/4/14,5,The BEST EVER! My Hubby and kids couldn&#039;t get enough. They did need to cook a little longer than specified but it was well worth the wait. This one is a keeper:)
2001655069,498803,2017/8/3,5,"This recipe worked a charm! Was my first time making cinnamon rolls and although I made a little mistake when I was making the dough, I managed to make it work and they turned out super fluffy and delicious. Will definitely make again!"
2002114782,498803,2018/4/21,5,"These turned out beautifully. I baked them in muffin tins for 18 minutes, as my large pan is out on loan. They’re perfect rosettes of cinnamon goodness. Discovered too late that we’re out of Vanilla, so used Almond extract instead. That worked fine!"
2001346243,500210,2017/1/10,5,"Our schedule didn't allow for all the cooking to be done at once, so I took a chance and roasted one night then broiled the next. Still turned out moist, very tender, and absolutely delicious!"
2001354818,500210,2017/1/16,3,Very easy to make. Good flavors. Could have used a bit of sweetness for my personal tastes but still very good.
286566,504123,2013/8/5,5,"I made the very basic recipe using wholemeal/wholegrain bread, eggs, pepper and sharp cheddar cheese and baked at 175C fan forced for 20 minutes and the yolks had just began to set though by the time I got to eating the second one it had fully set, I had left them in the ramekins and had them for lunch with a salad on the side.  Thank you Sharon123, made for Please Review My Recipe."
212609,504123,2014/3/25,5,"I made these as a rare weekend breakfast treat for me and DH......what a way to start the day...they were fabulous!!&lt;br/&gt;I used a muffin tin well sprayed with oil, and my cups popped out no problem.&lt;br/&gt;Definitely don&#039;t skimp on the black pepper....it just raises the bar on it.....and I used the hot sauce on the cheese before putting them into the oven.&lt;br/&gt;My only complaint, if you will, was that after 15 mins of cooking in my fan forced oven, the yolks were just on the point of setting, and I much prefer a runny yolk...however that little wrinkle is for me to iron out, and of no way a fault of the recipe...every oven is different.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you so much for a lovely little recipe Sharon....DELICIOUS!!!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."
1179225,504123,2014/4/19,5,"Fun and tasty recipe! Used ramekins and and baked for 20, and the yolks were soft, but not runny. Next time I&#039;ll bake for 15.Buttering the bread was really important, it really added nice flavor to the cups.  I like Noo&#039;s idea of adding a little hot sauce to the cheese for a little zing. Such a nice simple recipe. I&#039;ll be making these little guys again. Thanks for sharing."
526614,504123,2014/11/14,5,good recipe. thanks. my kids LOVED these.
88099,500210,2013/10/12,5,This is one of the best pork roast that I have made in a very long time.  The spice combination Was just perfect.  The meat was so moist and tender you could truly cut with a fork.  The veggies were a beautiful addition to the dish.  I did decrease the cooking time as my roast was only 3.5 pounds.  I cooked for 1 1/2 hours then broiled as directed  except only about 5 minutes per side and it turned out perfect.  You just have to watch it as directed so it doesn&#039;t get too brown.  I also used the full 14 1/2 oz can of beef broth as I didn&#039;t want to waste any and it seemed to work fine.  This is a recipe that I will make again and share with others.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for My 3 Chefs event 2013.
1802911870,500210,2014/7/18,5,"I tried this recipe last week using a pork roast that I never got around to cooking over the 4th of July weekend.  Girlfriend opted out, stating something about the roast being potentially &quot;creepy&quot;  having been thawed out for a couple of days... &quot;All the more for me&quot; as my mother always said.     &lt;br/&gt;I used some home made lemon pepper and a bit of garlic salt. Added lemon thyme and kale from my garden. It was great. A bit of gravy from the pan drippings would have really set it off. Next time for sure."
1803444181,500210,2014/12/1,0,Absolutely wonderful. Afraid the veggies would be overdone because of the cooking time but they weren&#039;t. Made a roux with butter and flour and added liquid from this recipe for gravy. I am picky but will serve this again and again. Thanks for a new and flavorful recipe.
1802669248,500210,2014/12/24,5,The fam LOVED it!  I cooked it exactly liked stated and it was a strong 5 star recipe! Glad I tried it and will cook it again
1803650195,500210,2015/1/12,5,Delicious and fork tender..juicy. I&#039;ll be making again.
1800116701,500210,2015/1/16,0,I just saw where I put the garlic.I&#039;m making it for a dinner party tomorrow...can&#039;t wait.I will report back on how it turned out.Thanks for posting it.
1803701945,500210,2015/1/24,5,Recipe produced the tastiest pork roast dish I have ever cooked. Did some adjusting because my roast was only 1.5 pounds. I had no onion powder so I threw in some spices my daughter bought in France. The roast and vegggies (which I might have broiled a bit much) had an incredible rich flavor. Will make this again and again.
2000087268,500210,2015/3/25,2,"Good flavor, very dry for roast type! Veggies came out good."
2000153319,500210,2015/4/19,5,"I used a little less dry rub but it turned out awesome. Before I broiled it, I drained most of the juice and reduced it before making gravy. Best meal in a while!"
2000152446,500210,2015/4/20,5,"Positively Fabulous!  I used a 2 lb. roast and adjusted the roasting time to 1 1/4 hours, then broiled as directed, but, for only about 6 minutes per side.  After resting, it was hot, juicy, and very tasty.  The veggies were perfectly done and the sauce thick and rich.   And, it looked just like the picture ... I love it when that happens!"
16459,500210,2015/4/26,5,"This recipe was easy to use. The roast was really,  really good. I made gravy from the pan drippings and I&#039;m pretty sure my life has changed for the better for having eaten that gravy. I did alter the cooking Tim to two hours since I had a smaller roast than the recipe calls for. I will definitely make this again and again."
2000175262,500210,2015/4/29,5,"Best roast I&#039;ve ever made! Big hit with my family. Tender, juicy and flavorful. I added extra veggies and the entire can of beef broth. Delicious! Broiling at the end adds extra flavor to the meat and veggies. Thanks for a great receipe!"
2000268313,500210,2015/6/14,5,"Absolutely fantastic but the Ingredient list mentions rosemary yet the instructions do not. I just sprinkled it with the parsley and it was delicious.

Will make again for guests next time."
2000283890,500210,2015/6/20,5,Easy and one of the best pork roasts! The spice combo is fantastic.  I saved the leftovers and made Cubanos!
2000294314,500210,2015/6/25,5,"Let me start by saying that I am very skeptical when it comes to trying new recipes when I have one that already works and I NEVER provide reviews, but this time I did both.  I had a pork roast and decided to give this recipe a try based on all of the positive comments.  Well, I was not disappointed!  This recipe cooks to perfection as presented.  I made no adjustments to the recipe, except for one addition.  At the halfway mark, when I turned the roast, I added fresh broccoli and yellow squash to the potatoes and carrots.  It was a HUGE success.  My husband, children, and even grandchildren could not stop talking about it! The roast was moist and tender. The flavor of the pork roast is wonderful and carries through to the vegetables.  Even my non-vegetable eaters ate their vegetables and asked for more!  I am not sure when and if I will use my old recipe again. We are already planning to cook this again!"
2000426002,500210,2015/8/24,4,"My review is based upon LOOKS, not taste, as I have four  comments before cooking time is over:  1.  I assume veggies are to be removed before the broiling begins (I did that) 2. I used a glass dish, so I had to transfer meat to a metal pan before subjecting it to such a high temp.  3. My pan is now a MESS from the spatter; fat and juices are now baked firmly to my previously-gleaming aluminum pan.  4. I have turned the meat over for the last time and will NOT be letting it broil for 10 minutes; that will make it too brown, and my pan is already going to be a headache to clean.  On the positive side, the house smells fantastic and I&#039;m looking forward to our meal. Why do we need to do the broiling and turning?"
2000473858,500210,2015/9/14,2,"Horribly dry.  I have no idea what I did wrong - I followed the directions exactly, except that I took it out 20 minutes before I was supposed it."
2000473995,500210,2015/9/14,5,"My 5lb. roast came out perfectly, delicious flavor, not dry at all. I would only use a little less seasoning, but not by much. Also state that you do need to remove the vegetables before broiling. I left mine in for the first broil but watched them closely. Seeing that they were getting too dark on the edges I removed them. While the roast was resting I tossed the veggies in the leftover juices and roasted during the 30 minute resting time. They were quite good! Such an easy recipe, it&#039;s a keeper."
12438141,500210,2015/10/8,5,"Fantastic!  Followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit with my boys, one being a chef.  Absolutely loved the spice rub, and use of beef broth.  It infused into the veggies to give them a great flavor.  The meat and veggies were so tender.  The flavors of the carrots and potatoes were super enhanced.  The 30 minutes of broiling provided a nice &quot;crust&quot; on the meat that my husband adores.  Kudos for this keeper.  I&#039;m sharing it with friends!"
835092,500210,2015/10/11,3,"First, let me say that the vegetables in this recipe were possibly the best I have ever tasted. The sad part is that the roast, itself, was pretty dry and bland, even though it was easy to cut with a fork. I think this recipe would be much better if it called for a pork shoulder or butt, which are better suited for low/slow cooking and more flavorful. I should have gone with my gut and ignore the pork loin that the recipe called for, but I try to make things according to the recipe the first time and tweak after that."
85573,500210,2015/11/9,5,This is a wonderful recipe and thanks so much for sharing it...Followed it to the letter and it was the best!!! The low temp made it so moist and tender and the vegies were perfect...Made the house smell so good we could hardly wait till it was finished.LOVED IT !!!
2000665483,500210,2015/11/11,5,"DELICIOUS!!!  I hate pork roast but make it for my husband.  This is the only recipe I have made where I enjoyed the meal.  The pork was tender but not stringy, vegetbles tender and flavorful.  My roast was a little over a pound so I cooked covered for 1 1/4 hours then broiled 5 minutes.  As I have a broken wrist I had to omit the onions (can&#039;t slice them).  Can&#039;t wait to make again with onions and gravy from the drippings."
2000722017,500210,2015/11/30,0,This recipe is fantastic! The whole family enjoyed it. So easy with great results!  Recommend this one for everyone.
2083517,500210,2016/1/2,1,Had great hopes after reading all the reviews. Cooked according to directions and this was so dry it was inedible.
2000828184,500210,2016/1/21,5,"This is absolutely DELICIOUS!  The only change I made was using dijon mustard before sprinkling the powder combination on, and omitted the oil.  My family LOVE IT!"
1802531050,500210,2016/3/1,5,I&#039;ve made plenty of pork roasts in my day but this was hands down the best. I seasoned the meat and veggies with the recommended seasoning and also added oregano in addition to cutting slits into the meat and stuffing it with garlic cloves.
2000953057,500210,2016/4/2,5,This was really great. Removed the roast from the pan prior to broiling to assure crispness. Used drippings and beef broth to make sauce. Be sure to season veggies.
2001063046,500210,2016/6/26,2,"I read all the great reviews on this roast and decided to give it a try. In my case, it didn't turn out to be the best ever recipe for me. My DH and I thought it had no taste. Based on the reviews, I was expecting something awesome and it was just plain boring. Followed the recipe exactly, except used a smaller roast and used a meat thermometer for doneness. There was one thing I couldn't find in the written recipe - when to use the rosemary. It wasn't mentioned at all that I could find, other than on the list of ingredients."
2001131123,500210,2016/8/17,5,"This recipe is great! It turned out just wonderful. I have a convection oven, with a 5.15 lb. roast it was done a lot sooner, but made sure I used a meat thermometer and turned out perfect! I had only enough time to turn it once, but still it was moist and delicious! Thanks"
12293335,500210,2016/10/23,2,"I followed the directions exactly for this recipe because one of my pet peeves is people who say...&quot;I changed, this...this..this&quot;. So, I can't believe people rated this at 5 stars. The vegetables were very good; however, the pork was so dry that it was almost inedible."
2001225608,500210,2016/10/30,5,This recipe came out fantastic! My roast was 2.5 lbs so I cut all ingredients and cook times in half. I have picky eaters and they loved it!!!
2001233043,500210,2016/11/5,3,"It was okay. Few changes -- pork was 3lb, forgot the rosemary, and I used low sodium beef broth. Found the broil times listed to be far too high. I went 7-7-5. The veggies were good, tasteful, and a little over done. The potato need to be cut large, or maybe even go in full. The pork was a little dry, but if you dunk it in the broth after cut, it works better. Even with the salt changes (in beef broth and salt) it was still very salty. Make sure you mix the dry ingredients well, they tended to pocket in places. If I made this again, I'd probably change a few things. Sear the pork first before baking. Cut slits in the pork and fill with garlic and rosemary. Use less salt, more pepper. Dry rub the whole loin, not just the top."
2000927477,500210,2016/11/20,0,The directions don't say when to add the rosemary. Or did I miss something?
2001356540,500210,2017/1/18,2,My pork came out very dry and tough. The potatoes and carrots were delicious the broth was good. I used a boneless sirloin pork roast. Maybe that was the wrong kind don't know. But I won't try to make it again.
2841506,500210,2017/1/19,0,Made this today for &quot;suppah&quot; ... It was amazing ... the roast was so moist and tender ... and the vegetables were delicious !! Thank You for &quot;sharing&quot; !!
2001371671,500210,2017/1/30,3,Recipe promised moist but found it to be too dry as loin usually turns out for me otherwise good flavor. Family says they prefer my herbcrusted tenderloin much better. Probably Will NOT make again
2001384313,500210,2017/2/9,5,Just tried this recipe! Everyone was so pleased. We all enjoyed it. This is super easy to cook. I will definately be making this again. Thank you. I adjusted it just a tad and added some hot peppers into the mix. Delicious.
2001175166,500210,2017/3/3,0,can you use chicken stock instead of beef stock?
2001199316,500210,2017/3/6,2,Meat was okay but a bit dry. I had a 3lb roast and cut the time by 45 min and it was still dry. However the biggest problem was the carrots and onions were so salty they weren't even edible! I would cut way back on the seasoned salt or skip it all together!
2001426243,500210,2017/3/10,0,I don't usually write reviews but this dish most definitely deserves one! Made this for my family and it was AMAZING!! My roast was only 3.44lbs. So I baked it for 2 1/2 hours as directed. And then broiled it on each side for 10 mins. As directed. Just didn't do it the third time. I was scared when the meat thermometer read 190&deg;. But much to my surprise it still cut like butter! It was delish! Our daughter that had already decided that she wasn't having dinner changed her mind as soon as I made plates for my husband and myself. This is definitely going into dinner rotation! Thanks for the recipe!!
2001433540,500210,2017/3/19,5,"This is such a wonderful meal, easy to put together, and the taste is incredible. I have been doing two 4 lbs loins in separate pans with same cook time, cooks perfectly!"
2001499294,500210,2017/4/20,5,This recipe is absolutely amazing. My first time ever making a loin roast and it went perfect following the cooking directions. The broiling at the end was the best final touch. This one is going in my recipe book to pass along to my daughter.
2001458294,500210,2017/4/23,0,I just prepared this and is in the oven! Super easy prep. I tweaked a few things such as I rubbed roast with evoo first so spice mixture would stick to roast better. I used red bliss potatoes and regular carrots that I cut in thirds. I will post again after dinner!
2001512439,500210,2017/4/29,3,"I used a 2lb. roast and followed the rest according to the recipe. First of all, it took just as long to cook to the proper temperature as the recipe stated the 4-5lb one would. After 90 minutes of cooking in the oven, the potatoes and carrots were still rock hard, so I took them out and cooked them on the stovetop. My husband said that maybe when the roast was under the broiler they would have finished cooking, but I was not confident at that point. The roast was good enough, but despite all the seasonings, not that tasty. I doubt I will cook this again. The extensive preparation was not worth the final result."
2001515716,500210,2017/5/1,5,"I loved this and the flavour-i cooked it a bit long-but the vegetables and sauce were so yummy.I didn't put rosemary in it because I didn't have any, I used halved cloves and stabbed them onto the top with toothpicks. I did put some sweet potato in the pan because I didn't have enough regular potato . I think it sweetened everything up like you usually have with pork. It was a lightly sweet and delish dish. Seriously I couldn't stop with the au juice!"
2001548869,500210,2017/5/22,5,"This was the best pork roast recipe I've found in a long time. I used it to cook a 4.5 lb shoulder roast with a small bone in it. I followed the directions exactly, except that I left out the rosemary (not a big fan). Everything worked perfectly. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. The meat was moist, flavorful, and falling apart delicious! My family thinks I'm a master chef."
2001580648,500210,2017/6/12,0,I made this tonight! It was so good. I used red potatoes because that's what I had on hand. Also i mixed the dried rosemary and parsley with the dry rub. I added asparagus in the last 10 minutes of baking and all of the broiling. (They were quite thin) it turned out delicious! Last thing - I made a roux of equal parts 2 tblspoons butter and flour and added the drippings to that until it combined for a nice gravy :)
2001764550,500210,2017/10/24,0,Did you use reconstituted beef broth or concentrated (e.g. Campbell's straight from the can and not diluted)? Looks like a great recipe.
2001778561,500210,2017/11/5,5,The only different I'd do next time is to prepare it the night before to allow the meat absorb the species.
2001559569,500210,2018/1/7,5,I made this for Sunday football and it was a huge hit!!!!
2001705219,500210,2018/1/24,5,"Turned out very well. here are my variations: like many, i used a smaller loin - about 2lbs. I put the olive oil on BEFORE the rub and atop that, minced garlic. In 100 minutes, the pork was cooked to 190F - I broiled the top only, four minutes was enough to sear the top and toast the garlic, which was a surprise treat. (i cooked in a stoneware dish, which like iron, will sear the bottom.)"
2001906623,500210,2018/1/28,5,"Super yummy. I had a small (1.5 lb) roast. I cooked for 25 mins, turned it &amp; cooked for 25 more. Internal temp was 150. I then uncovered it &amp; broiled it, and the intetnal temp went over 180 by the time it was done. Once on broil, turn every 5 minutes 3 times. I added celery to the veggies and I found the veggies were soft (but scrumptious) at the end of cooking. This dish was delicious."
2001997103,500210,2018/2/18,5,"I wish l could give it 10 ??!! It'll be a long time before l use another recipe. OMG! I followed one of the reviewer's lead and added broccoli. I also added portabella mushrooms and green beans after the 1/2 way point. Super delish! The only change l would make is using 1/2 the salt. My roast was 4.6 lbs. Perfection!!! Love, love, love."
2002045777,500210,2018/3/12,5,It was my first time cooking a pork roast with veggies. It was great but I only had to do the broiling twice and it was almost too much. The veggies were beautifully tender and tasty. My kids ate carrots for the first time! Loved it .... will make it again!
2002056145,500210,2018/3/17,4,I've always made pork roast along with a beef roast Lipton soup mix and tomato paste which makes a lot of food. Now that our sons have moved out I was looking for a new recipe to make just the pork roast. Let me just say that I thought this was going to be way too much salt because we don't eat a lot of salt... but it was actually really nice. Now I slightly seared my roast before I put it in the oven so I didn't need to do all the browning afterwards and the whole meal that I had wouldn't fit in a 9 by 13 pan so I used a roasting pan and used the whole can of beef broth but everything else was the same. The roast was already at 160 plus at the end of two and a half hours so I gave it a quick 7 minutes right side up on broil and got it out. My hubby and I liked it and I'll try this again
2002064020,500210,2018/3/20,0,Will this recipe work in a slow cooker?
327239,500210,2018/3/22,1,"The star is a negative star for the pork! This recipe is the not correctly done you need to redo... I have been a executive chef for over 30 years and have never....I repeat never cooked pork to the dried out state that your recipe does...i don’t understand the ratings that you have received,.... I’m totally baffled.."
1800094111,500210,2018/4/2,0,How would I turn this into a slow cooker recipe?
2002005193,500210,2018/4/2,2,"Flavoring is good (anything with beef broth with taste good), but it's not the best way to cook a pork roast"
2002100998,500210,2018/4/7,5,"I made this Easter Sunday for 14 people, including 6 kids. It turned out beautifully. My guests loved it and complimented me several times with one person requesting the recipe. I will definitely make this again, likely at Christmas time. I made a 5.25 lb pork loin roast. We had some leftovers, approximately 4 slices of pork. We ate every bit of the leftovers after Easter. I used a 14&quot; roasting pan and more than doubled the amount of potatoes for our group. Therefore I did not have room for the carrots so I steamed them separately in a saucepan. I intend to buy a larger roasting pan before I make this recipe again so I can include the carrots with the roast. The potatoes were so tasty after cooking with the pork and I want the carrots to have a similar flavor the next time I make this. I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe. Tender meat with fabulous, incredible flavor. And so easy to prepare! My kind of cooking! Thank you, IronChefNicole!"
2002104247,500210,2018/4/9,1,"Can I say no stars? This was the driest, worst pork roast I have ever cooked. I followed the recipe and the meat was dry - though tented, the potatoes over cooked and soaked up whatever moisture was available from the roast. Such a disappointment. Never again. It is not possible to cook pork for this long and have a moist roast. And too much salt!! A tablespoon for one roast and veggies!"
2002104250,500210,2018/4/9,4,My husband said this was among the five best meals I ever made. The meat was very tender and all was delicious.
1702716,500210,2018/4/16,0,Can I use a pork roast instead of a tenderloin?
2001080387,500210,2018/5/20,0,"Way too much salt! One tablespoon! No way! If the recipe has to be &quot;tweaked&quot; by others, then it should not appear here. The recipes that appear on this site should be to perfection!"
2002162456,500210,2018/5/23,4,"I've made this 4 times so far and am about to make it again. My family loves it - with some tweaks. First, as others have mentioned thatsalotta salt. Half a tablespoon tastes about right to me. Second, 2 1/2 hours and then roasting it for another half-hour is waaaayyyyy too long. The first two times I cooked it I didn't know any better. The last couple of times it came out perfect - juicy like it should be. The National Pork Board recommends 20-25 minutes per pound for a loin roast at 350 degrees. The recipe recommends 325 degrees so I added a bit more time to it but also used a meat thermometer. 160 degrees is &quot;medium.&quot; I look for about 140-145 before I switch over to the roasting phase of the recipe. A large cut of meat will rise up to 10 degrees as it sits, too. The last one I cooked was 4 lbs and 90 minutes (a full hour less than the recipe calls for) got it to where I wanted it temperature-wise, and then I roasted it. It came out perfect. Vegetables, too. And has anyone else noticed that rosemary is in the ingredients list but not in the directions? I sprinkle it on with the parsley in step 3."
2002171082,500210,2018/5/31,5,"This was Delish! I did not have Rosemary on hand so left that out, and added cloves of garlic (about 6) and celery stalks in veggie mix. I used russet potatoes since that was what I had on hand. Also topped the roast with Tastefully Simple's Onion Onion in addition to the rub of seasonings. Had to turn up the heat since I did not have enough time to let it cook as recipe stated. I should have started it earlier. Still turned out really tasty! I made a gravy from the pan juices and it was very good!"
2002174998,500210,2018/6/4,0,"How long should I cook mine, if my roast weighs 1.95 lbs?"
2002219518,500210,2018/7/15,5,"Absolutely delicious! The only thing I tweaked was the rosemary because I had none so I sprinkled oregano leaves on it. My husband loves pork, me...I can live without it, but my son picked up a whole boneless pork loin on sale and split it with me. The last thing in my freezer was a 3 lb roast, so I googled pork roast recipes and chose this one. I followed the recipe to the letter (except for the rosemary) because I'm not the type of talented cook who can just grab stuff and throw it in. I've never enjoyed eating pork before because no matter how much garlic I put on it, it never seemed to taste like anything. This was so moist and tasty that I was still picking on it as I sliced the last of it up to save for sandwiches. Now I have to look for sales on pork loins in the supermarket because I'll definitely be making this again."
12763935,500210,2018/8/14,2,"I don’t know if I would make this again without some serious tweaking of the spices/Garlic. Yes it was juicy and tender. However, all you could taste was the 10 cloves of garlic the recipe called for. It didn’t compliment the meat, it took it over!! Very disappointed."
2002278676,500210,2018/9/19,5,How is this recipe not illegal to make!! Omgawwwd this is so delicious beyond delicious. I used a cheap butt cut and it turned out great.
2002290418,500210,2018/10/2,3,"Good but overcooked. I will go about an hour and 3/4 next time. Other than that, all was good."
679953,512748,2014/2/12,5,"Though I might cut back on the sugar next time, this was a fantastic snack for us tonight.  Loved the pecan pie flavor, (plenty of it).  Very easy to make too.  Made this for PRMR Tag."
724631,512748,2014/5/1,0,"I am not comfortable giving any stars because my inexperience in candy-making is most likely the culprit.  When my sugar became the color of bittersweet chocolate I suspected I had missed the boat; I think I produced Burnt Sugar Pecan Brittle.  I&#039;ll try tasting it once it cools.  I rarely make desserts, and this might be my second attempt at candy.  I guess I need a &quot;never-fail&quot; recipe to match my prowess.  DH loves pecans and pecan pie, so he&#039;ll have to console himself by eating the left over pecan halves.  Attempted for Please Review My Recipe.  Again, I am sure that I was the problem, sorry RP."
895132,503663,2013/7/16,5,"Five stars! Easy, tasty, very juicy - this will be a keeper for grilling!

65502,503663,2013/7/18,5,I used 2 breasts for this recipe and made it as directed. I have to admit that I thought that all of the spices would be really salty or &quot;unpleasant&quot;. So not true! The blend is fantastic! I really enjoyed the chicken with recipe #503410 and recipe #503664. Made for my fellow Tasty Tester. Thanks EK! :)
2001662043,524315,2017/8/7,1,Where do I get &quot;parmesan paper&quot;???
2001928068,524315,2018/1/13,0,I’m pretty certain he meant parchment paper.
128473,496780,2013/10/24,5,"Awesome recipe Sharon.  I really love German pancakes and these mini&#039;s are wonderful.  Really nice flavor and texture.  Quick and easy to make with terrific results.  I filled them with lemon curd and then garnished with icing sugar, strawberry sauce and whipped cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe that I will make again.  Made for Think Pink 2013"
114027,496780,2013/10/31,5,So good! I made some with the strawberry sauce and some with cherry jam. Both were very good. Will make again for sure! Made for Think Pink 2013.
542159,536086,2018/7/7,5,"Really liked this dish! It was easy to make, packaged well, and made for a very special work lunch. Beside tasting great also liked that it was not too wet or too dry. Served with Pistachio Couscous. I will be making this again, thanks for the post."

2002332332,509668,2018/11/14,5,Loved this! I doubled this and it was great.
1060667,501884,2017/4/1,5,"Absolutely delicious!! I made a few changes though, I was out of parsley so I used cilantro and because I didn't feel like pulling out my food processor, I just chopped everything up very small and went with it :) Worked just fine. Served over angel hair pasta, so yummy!!"
7676,531410,2017/12/14,1,I’m afraid to try. I’m certain the recipe is incomplere. Ears boiled for 1 minute then served with a sauce! Raw ears! This dish is usually deep fried - after boiling for a minute and breading the ears.
317187,508263,2013/10/24,0,"I love,love,love ribs this way!  I&#039;ve been doing them this way for years. I put my rub on them the day before, wrap in foil and refridgerate overnight.  The next day I proceed as this recipe says, but am careful not to let water touch the rack holding the ribs. Also, add 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the water.  Always come out full of flavor and fall off the bone delish !"
1800150110,508263,2013/10/24,5,SO delicious. I loved the brown sugar rub with the tangy BBQ. Fell right off the bone so clean and the touch in the grill for that nice char. Bravo. Definitely the only way I am EVER doing ribs again!!!
1803321506,508263,2014/11/9,5,"This recipe is amazing! It&#039;s super simple and very tasty! I&#039;ve used this recipe many times so I&#039;ve tweaked it just a little. I use slightly more garlic powder than it calls for... probably 1.5 to 2 tsp., I use all of the rub on a single rack of ribs, probably 3.5 lbs. of meat, because we like a lot of flavor and I double up on the foil to make sure no moisture escapes. Seriously, the best recipe. I always get rave reviews!"
2000293897,508263,2015/6/25,5,"Ribs were awesome! They were so tender and juicy. It was our first time cooking them and now it&#039;s out favorite recipe!

Thank you for sharing!"
2000305435,508263,2015/6/30,5,I made these last night and they were amazing.  They literally fell off the bone.  This is one recipe I will add to the file and make over and over again.  Would be great for a crowd.  So easy. A must try
2123645,508263,2015/7/14,5,"I&#039;ve made a few rib recipes on this site, and I would have to say that this is the best so far. So tender and flavorful. Difficult to grill because the bones do literally fall off, but the grilling adds great flavor. Overall a wonderful recipe!"
2000831983,508263,2016/5/2,0,This is so good for me delicious but it was so good.
1206102,495289,2013/2/25,5,"Delicious!  Good warm, even better cold!  Nice picnic dish."
2001483858,508263,2017/4/11,5,"I have always had a hard time with pork, but this recipe turned out perfect. I didn't have a 2 piece broiler pan, but I did have a large roaster. So I put on my thinking cap and placed 3 balls of aluminum foil underneath the ribs in order to prop them up and proceeded to pour in the 3 cups of water; covered it up and set the timer for 3 hours. When the timer went off, I had the most tender, fall off the bone ribs. I was always afraid of pork, because I could NEVER get it right, but this recipe is a no fail, tasty recipe. Just do it. It is delicious. Thank you so much for giving me faith again in pork and my own cooking abilities."
2001494871,508263,2017/4/17,0,These ribs are awesome ! I can't stop making them. My family loves them!
2001512759,508263,2017/6/17,5,"So good and soooo easy. Thank you for the recipe! Unfortunately, forgot to take a picture when I served them and there were no leftovers, so no pictures, but the ribs were fantastic! I did not have a grill, so finished mine of by broiling for 4 minutes. Turned out beautiful and tasty."
2001612847,508263,2017/7/4,5,"Wow! These ribs are delicious and now will be my go to recipe for ribs. I didn't change a thing except only used one rack of baby back ribs to the rub in the recipe. My men folk loved the ribs! Next time I make it, I will try broiling the ribs vs grilling. Plus, will increase the garlic powder and add liquid smoke to the water as a few comments suggested. And, yes, the ribs are so tender that they basically fall off the bone."
2001891892,508263,2017/12/26,5,Very easy and great! To answer some questions I placed the ribs directly on the broiler pan and tightly tented the foil over the ribs and tucked it well around the sides to allow the steam to penetrate the ribs but not escape. Finished with Ray’s on the grill to perfection!
266635,506630,2013/9/12,5,"Here in the South, bread pudding is a favorite dessert and this recipe did not disappoint.  I used raisin challah bread vs. french bread as I love this rich egg bread.

135566,514985,2014/5/5,5,"Addicting potatoes that are easy to make.  I did not use the Simply Potatoes as my grocery store does not carry them, so I peeled and thinly sliced a large baking potato.  I quartered the recipe and used a 1-quart baking dish with a lid.  Baked in my toaster oven at 350 for 20 minutes, removed the lid and baked for an additional 10 minutes.  YUM!

461834,499101,2013/4/23,5,"Wonderful individual cakes!!!  I made this as written, using the jumbo pan, except we aren&#039;t big fans of maraschino cherries, so left them out.  The cakes came out easily once I ran a knife around the outside, except most of the brown sugar stayed in the bottom, which worked out perfectly for my level of sweetness.  Next time I would cut the butter and brown sugar in half, but that is my personal preference.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for New Kids On the Block Tag Game."
9137122,499101,2014/3/7,5,Absolutely delicious! It&#039;s a good thing this recipe makes just 6 mini cakes because we would eat them all! And we did!! It came out perfectly. When I flipped them onto a cooling rack I made sure a cookie sheet was underneath to catch all that brown sugar/butter syrup. Not because I didn&#039;t want a mess but because I wanted to redrip it over the cakes! Perfect! Don&#039;t forget to spray your pans before layering in the ingredients! ENJOY!
2000596051,499101,2015/10/23,5,This recipe is ridiculously delicious and I&#039;ve tried many pineapple upside down cake recipes.  I like that it doesn&#039;t use a boxed cake mix...you get a more authentic flavor and texture.  These would perfect to use as an elegant dessert at a dinner party...just top with a little whipped cream.
2001293645,499101,2016/12/12,5,"Made these several times now and they are always amazing! I have a standard size muffin tin, so I get 12 mini cakes out of the recipe. It's always a hit with the Hubs ????????"
2001426366,499101,2017/3/10,5,These came out really well...I was able to make 30 cupcakes. Six of them are coconut instead of cherries and they are really good. My kids loves it!
37449,503368,2013/8/24,5,"I enjoyed the taste of this tea,  fennel, ginger and peppermint! My tummy liked it too. Thanks Deb! Made for ZWT 2013."
386585,503368,2014/3/13,4,"Normally, I&#039;m not a great fennel fan, but it was actually okay in this tea.  I only made 1 serving, and had to use regular mint (couldn&#039;t find  peppermint anywhere).  I really like ginger, and this made a nice tummy-soothing cup of tea!  Thanks for sharing."
2549237,503368,2014/5/5,4,"This was super simple to make and I really wanted to love this tea, but it was &quot;my cup of tea&quot;.  I think it is because I don&#039;t like fennel.  I was really hoping that this would help settle my stomach, as chemo is making me very, very ill.  I want to try this again after chemo though.  Things that I normally really like seem to make me sick now and so I don&#039;t want to write this recipe off.  Thanks for something a little new.  Can&#039;t wait to try it again when I&#039;m not sick anymore.  Thanks Debbwl.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
2000228780,522117,2015/5/26,5,Surprisingly not bad as a burger replacement! I added a little less salsa though. I think I might add more garlic next time.
1244661,497109,2013/5/19,5,"I liked this - made it with veg bouillon instead of broth as it&#039;s all I had on hand.  Otherwise made as is, I found I needed a little salt and pepper to bring out the flavours.  The coconut milk really made this tasty and creamy.  Thanks RushinChef."
383346,509877,2013/12/17,5,"When I added the cup of milk to the meat, I thought it was too liquid.  So it really has to be in the fridge to firm up.  Finally the meatballs turned out moist and tasty with the sauce.  My son liked them a lot.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for PRMR tag game"

136997,513820,2014/3/6,5,"This was delicious. I used a dark ale and used some of it to cook the onions in. Despite that, my husband wasn&#039;t able to detect the beer flavor. However, he enjoyed it anyway. He&#039;ll just drink a beer with the wraps next time. LoL! I wasn&#039;t able to find the smoked Swiss cheese in our grocery stores, so just used regular Swiss. Made for New Kids on the Block Tag game. :)"
1802367977,513820,2014/7/10,1,for a sandwich it&#039;s way too much salt...almost a full days worth.....as a once in the blue moon meal OK but never a regular on my plate..
136997,507013,2013/9/25,5,"Hubs says it&#039;s a keeper. The only thing I did change was to use poached, shredded chicken thighs. Made for New Kids on the Block Tag Game. :)"

126440,507013,2013/10/14,5,"Great pasta dish, I made for two but had to add more broth to make enough sauce.  Wasn&#039;t sure if gnocchi was supposed to be cooked or not but decide not to cook first.  Turned out just fine."
1802744796,493351,2017/9/12,0,My little terrier dog &quot;Chance&quot; was recently dianosed with diabetes. I made a batch of these treats and both of my dogs love them. Easy to make and I have cut down the number of treats per day to help him lose some weight as well.
2002203149,493351,2018/6/30,0,My dog loves these! Occasionally I add finely chopped apple!
369715,493188,2013/3/12,4,These were good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written. Nice side dish.
2001018711,533995,2018/2/24,0,How are you supposed to print out the recipes? Thanks
2001425592,533995,2018/2/24,0,"I would like to stuff shells with all but Alfredo sauce as we don't like it. Has anyone used anything else, like a tomato sauce type instead?"
131349,519768,2014/12/27,4,"This is a delicious meal and can be changed just a bit, I added potatoes, 1/4 cup of Pearl Barley, I also added 1/2 tsp of Cumin and substituted red pepper flakes vs the cut up hot pepper just a pinch of that. This is a great way to use up Christmas turkey. This recipe is one you can add to or take away pieces you don&#039;t really have a taste for. Thanks to Broke Guy for posting this. I also used dried cranberries instead of the raisins."
860538,507115,2014/1/15,4,Very easy to prepare and everyone loved them!  I made these for the freezer for those quick grab breakfast mornings.  I just pop them in the microwave and wala!   My 2 yo grand wanted syrup with hers...lol.  Thank you for sharing!
1052873,505754,2013/9/7,5,"This was great - very flavorful. I used sweet potato rather than squash and also added some sliced celery - otherwise made as written. Crockpot on low for 7 hrs. DH was not a fan of the olives, but DS and I loved them. Made too late to count for ZWT 9!"
599450,494039,2013/2/25,5,"GREAT! Once you get past the ""lentils, anchovies, capers and a fried egg""! I had one person who expressed much doubt before production who, after the final product, expressed much appreciation! I wasn't sure what course this would fit to serve: hmm, breakfast? lunch? dinner? Any course, of course! I think this would make a SPECTACULAR brunch or lunch entr?e. I made as directed and served in individual ramekins; I also sprinkled some turmeric over the top of the eggs. Thanks, rpgaymer! Made for PRMR tag game."
37449,494039,2014/1/6,5,"I actually made this without the anchovies, but did use lots of Worcestershire sauce(which has anchovies in it). I enjoyed it a lot! Thanks!"
461834,511559,2014/1/17,5,"I am giving this a 5 star review based on the flavors and what I feel it would have been if I had used a fresh or day old bagel instead of using a previously frozen, Everything Bagel from Panera Bread which was fresh at the time of freezing, but now feel it wasn&#039;t the best way to make this recipe, so my fault.  The top part was nice and toasted, and of, course great flavors from the everything toppings, but the bottom layer was very soggy and hard for me to cut through, which I feel would have been different if it had been fresh or a day old bagel.  The only changes I made was to scale back the amounts to serve two and I substituted red bell pepper for the tomatoes.  I will definitely try this again in the future, as DH often goes out on the weekends and buys fresh bagels.  Thanks for sharing the recipe FLKeysJen.  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
895132,501365,2015/9/9,5,"My kind of crumble :) What can I say, I loved it and will make it again!

2000103128,511559,2015/3/31,5,"I have a confession to make - I had the SK original recipe, so I&#039;m not sure the review I am writing is for the exact recipe posted here. However ... can I just say it was the most satisfying, delightful and fully gorgeous casserole I&#039;ve had in ages? I am seriously considering making it for an Easter dinner pot luck just because, dagnabbit, it&#039;s that darn good!"
2001338555,511559,2017/1/8,4,I did not make this I was just admiring it because I am allergic to almost everything in this but it looks beautiful and has the appearance of a Jewish Lasagna I wish I could have tried it. I can't even put substitutes in for the items I can't have because there are too many.
2000634202,511559,2017/8/20,0,"I love it! I substituted out 4 bagels for slices of local Watsonville sourdough, and since my bagels and bread were plain added a bunch of dried herbs. I used my suegro's (father-in-law's) garden tomatoes and threw in a bit of kale- voila! Super happy with the taste- even without bacon, lox or capers. Deelish! Cant wait to share it with the fam when they wake up;)"
386585,492764,2013/1/22,5,"I have never been successful at making this before, with the coating usually falling off.  However, this recipe worked out perfectly for me and I think the tenderizing soak was a great idea.  The gravy also came out perfectly too!  I ended up with a lot of the dredging flour left over, so that's what I used in the gravy.  Thanks so much for sharing this fool-proof recipe."
2585084,492764,2013/5/6,5,This recipe is nearly the same as the way I have always made cube steak.  The only thing different was the marinade.  It made a wonderful difference in the flavor of the steaks.  The marinade also made them extra tender.  Thanks for posting this idea and delicious recipe.
169430,492764,2013/6/25,5,Outstanding. I&#039;ve never heard of the salt and vinegar bath and didn&#039;t use it this time as my cube steaks were already tenderized. This is now my go to recipe for one of DH&#039;d favorite dinners so the next time I&#039;ll try the vinegar treatment on an untenderized slice of beef. The gravy is pure country good and exactly as my gramma made it when I was growing up. Truly worth all 5 stars.
1159689,502552,2013/6/29,0,"Thanks, Luvbeingyoung!  This recipe IS wonderful!  Guaranteed that you and your family will love it!  Better than any restaurants attempt at Fettucine Alfredo!!"
169430,498758,2013/4/22,5,"So so good! I skipped the syrup as I didn&#039;t find the thought of any sweetness in this appealing (it&#039;s a personal thing) and didn&#039;t have the sprouts. Everything else went in though to make a pretty and very yummy lunch. No sweat to make, healthy and each bite is a treat. What more could you ask. :D"
2643012,516384,2014/6/5,0,Great recipe.  I subbed Italian seasoning for the rosemary and garlic powder for the thyme.  Delish.
7648705,516384,2014/11/21,5,"Updating last review on what i&#039;d added. &lt;br/&gt;I added grated Locatelli cheese and bread crumbs to the mixture. Then I added diced tomato and mozerrella cheese on top, Lastly, I added marina sauce atop of it. Was delicious."
724631,505699,2014/1/31,4,"Delicate flavors, although I used crushed red peppers (to accommodate a nursing mom).  This seemed like a side dish, rather than an entr&eacute;e.  The rice noodles soaked up the sauce, as they normally would.  This dinner group missed having additional delicious sauce (personal preference).  Next time we would use pork strips and stir-fry them.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
305531,492764,2013/11/16,5,Pure comfort food! I made this as directed and was so happy with the end result. I had never used the marinade before so gave it a try even tho my cube steak was already tenderized. It almost fell apart when I took it out of the marinade. lol. But it did add a nice flavor. Thanks breezer for sharing this nice keeper. Congrats again on your 2nd football win this year.
227978,492764,2013/11/18,5,"This was delicious, and it reminded me of the country fried steak my mom made so often during my childhood.  Although my cutlets were already tenderized, I went ahead and did the vinegar step anyway.  We didn&#039;t detect any vinegar taste in the end (which I&#039;m glad because it&#039;s not exactly my favorite).  It was just a wonderful, good old fashioned down-home cooking dish that everyone loved.  Thanks, breezermom."

2359243,518105,2014/9/11,5,This is my favorite! Loved the flaky pastry and the meat was so good! MMMM MMMM MMMM such good flavor!  I would have had a third and fourth plate if I didn&#039;t have to share with others! DELICIOUS!
1803126988,518105,2014/9/12,0,Very juicy and full of flavor!
198154,518118,2016/2/5,3,"Everyone in my family gave this 2 or 3 stars.  It smelt delicious while cooking but they were disappointed. The remark I got was &quot;Too bad it doesn&#039;t taste as good as it smells.&quot; DD didn&#039;t like it at all.  DH said it was okay, but not to make it again.  Meat marinated for 48 hours and I was afraid it would be too strong, but the flavor wasn&#039;t strong at all.  Everyone&#039;s taste is different. I guess this just isn&#039;t a recipe for us."
461834,527694,2016/8/1,5,"What a drink!! It has it all going on!! Plenty of rum (not for the faint at heart, lol), juice and loved the addition of the bitters (yummy) and grenadine. Drink one of these and you'll think your in Club Med!! Thanks for sharing this yummy cocktail recipe. Made for the Bahamas Rum Challenge in the Quest 2016."
1925885,527694,2016/8/7,5,"I'm in LOVE! Wow - this is one potent and tasty drink! If you like rum (cheaper than water, in the Caribbean!) then you'll love this drink too. The bitters are a great addition. DH would say it's a chick drink. I say I don't care!!!"
178427,497871,2013/4/3,5,Terrific! This is one sauce I will be making often. It is the perfect blend. I used it on deep fried prawns and french fries. Thanks for sharing. Made for PAC 2013.
383346,497871,2013/5/7,5,yummy!  Great sauce.  I&#039;ve been doing this sauce all winter without the rice vinegar.  But the addition of the rice vinegar adds a little something.  It was great in burgers.  Thanks The Frugal Cheflady :)  Made for cookbook tag game
1803073769,518192,2014/8/26,5,I was lucky enough to attend the BBQ this past weekend where these A1 Zesty Potatoes were served. They were umm umm good. I also overheard someone enquiring about the ingredients. Nice little twist on the standard sides expected at a BBQ.
2000431901,515079,2018/11/6,4,Great classic tuna sandwich recipe.
1287956,495401,2013/2/17,5,"Any time a recipe starts with two cubes of butter, I know it's going to be good -- but this is even better than good.  It's buttery, savory, sweet, crunchy and (don't tell my husband this) better than sex!  Since the Mad Scientist is an analytical chemist for an agriculture company that specializes in testing nuts, I had just roasted some almonds he had brought home earlier in the week, and added that to the popcorn-caramel-bacon mixture, and it only enhanced it even more.  Debating whether I want to share this at work, or just hog it all for myself."
2123645,495401,2014/4/30,5,What a fantastic combination! I love caramel corn and bacon and bourbon.....and I loved this recipe. My husband took some it in to work to share and it got raves! Just make sure not to over-boil or over-bake because the coating can become grainy.
415536,495401,2014/7/12,5,Very good. Wasn&#039;t sure if Jack Daniels would work but it turned out fine.  Only suggestion I have is to mix it in a bowl instead of all on the pan. Using the pan made it hard to mix  evenly and a lot kept fallin off the pan.  But a good recipe.
1900559,495401,2014/10/8,5,You had me at bourbon and popcorn!  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!
1802988074,495401,2014/10/9,0,Think I will Try this one sounds very interesting and tasty
1900301,495401,2015/3/10,5,Don&#039;t forget to keep this refrigerated.  A lot of bacon fell off but it was delicious.
400708,495401,2016/5/22,5,"What a great combo of flavors. This was a hit with everyone that tried it, I'll be making it often. I did add 1 teaspoon of crushed red peppers for a bit of spice and feel it really enhanced it even more"
131126,508147,2014/5/2,1,This didn&#039;t work out for me at all.  I reduced the amounts to make a smaller pan and the batter was so thick to be unusable.  Even after adding more milk it was still thicker than my regular recipe.  After baking it was very dense. The flavor though showed promise and the idea of smoked paprika and smoked cheese appealed to me.  Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2014.
37449,510337,2013/12/11,5,This was delicious as a sandwich spread but even more delicious after it sat for awhile. Love the roasted onion flavor. Thanks!
135470,510337,2014/5/5,5,"This was quite tasty, I reduced the quantity to make enough for two burgers, because the burgers were well seasoned I skipped the salt.This was a great way to get nice onion flavor without adding more bulk to a burger. made for PRMRT"
494867,502329,2013/7/6,5,"Loved these!  They went together really quickly.  And while I didn&#039;t do it, I&#039;m sure you could mix some spices right into the mixture if you want hotter nuggets.  A tip for efficiency: make all the nugget balls first.  Then with one hand, dip them in the milk, and with the other coat them with the corn flakes.  Will make many times I&#039;m sure!"
400708,500181,2014/4/6,5,"Tender is right, this are so light and tender and easy to make.  I did add both cinnamon AND nutmeg to mine and then served with Holiday Cranberry butter (recipe#491196) and real warm Maple syrup with hot coffee and bacon.  A very special and tasty breakfast.  I&#039;ve made many different recipes for pancakes and this has to be one of the best.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
945395,504529,2013/7/25,5,"Wow, is this good. I used Silk Vanilla almond milk and ground ginger, but didn&#039;t have any ginger candies or candied ginger -- but it came out perfect. Thanks!"
169430,504529,2013/9/15,5,"I&#039;m about half way through my first cup of this lovely chocolate. Used True Almond (vanilla) and the candied ginger. What a great morning warm up and wake up. I don&#039;t even miss my coffee with this, and thats saying a lot! I usually keep all of the ingredients on hand so it will be easy to recreate this masterpiece quickly and easily at any time. A complete winner all the way. :D"
1803400336,504529,2014/11/24,5,"Tried this combination in Amsterdam, the shop owner questioned it... but it was so good. I am looking for recipes... just tried a bit of  fresh sliced ginger steeped in hot coco.. subtle and tasty."
169430,515650,2015/5/31,5,"I made a 2 serving size of this today omitting and sweetening and the dill (yuck). The result is a delicious, very easy and healthy dish. I&#039;ll be using this for lunch but we always have to have a small sample dish, at least I do, lol. The tea isn&#039;t at all overpowering but certainly gives a lovely minty essence that blends wonderfully with the whole."

Can a sprinkle of sugar be added before serving? What about topping with fresh fruits? More serving suggested need. Thanks for posting.

228458,503299,2013/8/26,4,"This was well-received at our table, though since some of us aren&#039;t coriander lovers it was a bit strong and we agreed that next time I should use less of the mixture on each ear. I might also increase the cumin and decrease the coriander, but that&#039;s just personal preference. This was terrifically easy to put together, and a nice change of pace. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 9, Gourmet Goddesses."
1745502,503299,2013/9/1,5,This is so simple to make. I grilled my corn. DH thinks he would use butter next time; I was fine with the olive oil. This is a nice change from everyday corn.
37449,505683,2013/9/30,5,Yummy! Made my own coleslaw mix with cabbage and carrots. Love the dressing!  I halved the recipe and enjoyed! Thanks! Made for My 3 Chefs event.
107583,505683,2014/4/13,5,"Great slaw!  Just like KFC.  I didn&#039;t add onion, but added some dried cranberries which worked great.  This was a hit at the BBQ.  Made for Spring 2014 PAC."
2000229379,505683,2015/7/2,5,"I&#039;ve made this recipe twice now.  I love it!  I shredded my own cabbage and added 1/2 cup of shredded carrots.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you!

My first attempt, there was just too much sugar.  We really don&#039;t eat a lot of sugar in our household, so we may just be sensitive to it.  I added more vinegar to help even it out some.

My second attempt, I cut the sugar portion to less than half.  There was still too much sugar, so I think I will just leave the sugar out all together."

2618549,493629,2013/1/20,0,These are delicious!
2001154001,527206,2016/9/4,5,"They turned out amazing!! They are fluffy and moist, with awesome flavor. Poppyseed muffins are my husbands favorite and since switching to GF we have struggled to replace them."
2000828425,513005,2016/1/19,5,Delicious! My husband and I loved this.
2000233731,512826,2015/5/29,1,The recipe is unbelievably SO SALTY! I had a feeling it will be super salty with the 1/4 cup oyster sauce plus the several tablespoons low sodium soy sauce. I had to add 2 cups of water and discard it afterwards to make this dish edible.
2934397,496827,2014/2/10,5,I made a batch of these and they turned our wonderful. They are a perfect snack for on the go or just sitting around with a sweet tooth.LOVED THEM!!
131126,499903,2013/5/25,5,This has delicious veggies and a nice tart dressing. I prepped the salad ahead and laid out much like a summer chef salad.  The  lemony dressing was added at serving time. I served  with Pa Amb Tomaquet (Tomato Toast) while participating in My Food Odyssey.
383346,499903,2013/5/27,5,This is a great salad.  So tasty.  I didn&#039;t use the almonds.  I used red bell pepper and the optional paprika in the dressing.  I will be doing this salad often.  Me and DH liked it so much.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for PRMR tag game
482376,499903,2013/5/28,5,Delicious salad! I love the flavor combinations. The dressing was the perfect complement to the salad ingredients. I&#039;ll be making this one often. Thanks!

2000250456,503781,2015/6/5,5,If i could give this 10 stars I would.  Throw all your other snickerdoodle recipes away. you will never use them again
368078,503781,2015/8/7,5,"I agree with the other reviewer...10 stars and definitely the best snickerdoodle muffin recipe I&#039;ve tried!  I halved the recipe to make 6 muffins, but otherwise didn&#039;t change a thing.  Rolling the dough in the cinnamon/sugar helps it not stick to the muffin paper, which is helpful as well.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
2731384,497019,2013/3/10,5,Love this recipe. Great dip for tortilla chips.
2002242198,505834,2018/8/7,1,"This was the worst banana bread I have ever tasted in my life. No flavor. Needs salt and some sort of sweetener or a higher ratio of banana to keep it sweet. I thought the water was an unconventional addition, and I was right! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME MAKING THIS! The texture is fine, but the flavor is just awful."
2803273,521555,2017/7/2,5,This was really good. I added a can of green chiles to it and followed the recipe. Super Easy. A bit spicy so I added more sour cream.
482933,510384,2013/12/15,5,"Delicious bread, chewy! Well worth the wait. Not hard to do but you do need to be nearby. Divided up differently--instead made 4 rolls.  Here in Arizona I do not have a baking stone so just left it on the parchment paper.  Going to make again but leave starter out longer. Thank you for sharing, chefgrpa."

2549237,505723,2013/8/20,4,"This soup was good.  I made a few changes, but made the soup basically as directed.  I used Kosher salt instead of sea salt because that&#039;s what I had on hand.  I used Chicken quarters instead of bone-in breasts and wings because it was more cost effective.  I used regular basil instead of Thai basil because I couldn&#039;t find the Thai basil anywhere around here.  And I added a very generous amount of the Srirracha, simply because we love things spicy.  I served this soup with Oyster crackers and Egg rolls for a delicious dinner tonight.  Thanks for a great chicken soup JD.  Made for the Asian round of ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers."
107583,505723,2013/8/27,5,"Excellent recipe that lends itself to variations.  Lots of flavor.  I used homemade chicken stock I had on hand, so skipped the wings, necks, etc.  I just added the ginger and green onion tops to it and simmered for about an hour.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and poached it in the broth before shredding.  From there on in I followed the recipe.  Loved the cilantro and basil and also added some Red Rooster chili-garlic sauce.  Would be good with tofu instead of chicken, and also with shiitakes.  Made for ZWT 9."
2597942,511408,2014/1/5,5,Brief review... I&#039;m typing from my dying cell phone. Loved these biscuits! Changes: I cut the sugar down to 3 teaspoons and I used a hollowed tuna-fish can to cut the dough (I don&#039;t bake much). Served as a side to Recipe #482719. Thanks for sharing. (Made for PRMR)
169430,511408,2014/8/5,5,"I made a half amount with no sweetening at all and they were great. Used as the biscuit base for a down home dinner of biscuits and sausage gravy. So savory, so fluffy, so down right delicious. Not hard to make either, always a plus. Thanks for this one Kate."
107135,511408,2014/9/17,5,very good  cakepops on parade
128473,511408,2014/9/19,5,"WOW, did we ever love these simple biscuits.  Never tried them with cracked pepper before, certainly will from now on.  These delicious little treats were quick and easy to make, with ingredients always found in the pantry.  We really enjoyed the flavor and the texture, crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014 - Family Picks - Suitcase Gourmets."
865936,495331,2013/3/1,4,"I really, really enjoyed this!  I was tempted to use less curry powder, but as it turns out it is just right as written.  I have never before added cocoa powder to a savory dish before and found the addition very interesting. I liked this the more I ate it.  Served over rice."
131126,495331,2013/3/2,5,"The flavor in this dish was off the charts! Although the finished product could use some color, each bite is delicious. The flavors are complex, slightly sweet, mild, well seasoned, and was so good it scored as one of my favorite contest recipes.  I admit to major doubts when it came time to add so much cocoa powder and I honestly had a backup sandwich meal planned just in case, but it's a contest recipe so I closed my eyes and added it all.  The dish smelled wonderful, but turned a blah brown.  I had chopped all of the veggies approx the same size as the peas.  We loaded it into homemade pitas with leaf lettuce, thin slices of purple onion, and tomatoes. One bite had us convinced the chef had presented us with a keeper of a recipe. Next time I might add red pepper and possibly sprinkle with cilantro for color.  Good luck in the contest!"
58104,495331,2013/3/3,4,"I wanted to kick this up so I added 1 Jalapeno minced, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon cumin seed that I toasted. 100% DV of sodium in one dish is way to much. Ponzu a citrus-based sauce commonly used in Japanese cuisine would have been a useful ingredient that would have worked great in place of the 4 tablespoons of soy. I just couldn't add all the soy so I used 2 tablespoons. Garnished with Fresh cilantro and Green Onion I did serve in the pita (Greek) as suggested I would have like to see rice or udon noodles. Thank you."
157425,511408,2014/9/26,5,Making bread or biscuits is not an easy thing for me but this recipe worked out well. I used the food processor and couldnt find biscuit cutters so used a glass about that size. Loved the pepper flavor and how moist and fluffy the biscuits turned out. Made and reviewed for the 2014 Culinary Quest - Family Picks.
2001557753,535781,2018/6/6,5,"There are about 20 circles cut out of the top crust, and there are at least three times that many used on the edge of the crust. Where do the additional circles come from?"
2002151276,535781,2018/8/14,0,"“freeze-dried blueberry powder“. Where on earth do we look for this? We have a decent number of supermarkets around, but have never seen that ingredient anywhere!"
163112,503604,2013/7/18,5,"A winner!  It&#039;s like a souffle!  I didn&#039;t peel the apples which didn&#039;t affect the final result at all.  I was worried it would overflow but didn&#039;t.  Bex &amp; I drizzled a bit of *real* maple syrup over it.  Absolutely delicious &amp; stunning presentation without a lot of work.  Made for ZWT9, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers, Cajun/Creole region.  Thank you!"
128473,503604,2016/8/19,5,"Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe diner. Wow, was it good. Light, tender, fluffy and delicious. It puffed up perfectly. Easily one of my favorites for this quest. I made half the recipe and had enough to share with my hubby. We both enjoyed it tremendously. I reserved some of the apple syrup and left it simmering while the pancake baked, I then used the warm syrup to pour over the baked pancake, it was wonderfu. Kudos to you my friend, for making it into my Favorites Cookbook for 2016. Made for CQ3 - New York"
2938127,505477,2013/8/9,3,I did not like these at all...the cocoa powder is too strong. No banana or peanut butter taste at all. They need some type of suger (preferably diabetic type) They leave a nasty aftertaste and no one in my house enjoyed them. Needs a recipe rehab unless I did something wrong.
2960032,505477,2013/8/26,1,"I will say I thought the recipe was easy and they smell great coming out of the oven, however the best thing they are used for is as a practical joke .. they taste awful and bitter"
1800038030,505477,2013/8/29,1,"Sorry, this is one awful recipe. Very disappointing. Consistency of dough and bitter, offensive taste.  Perhaps cutting back on the cocoa powder and adding honey would help?"
1800048901,505477,2013/9/6,1,I would give this recipe no stars if I could.  I agree with the others.  Whoever came up with this recipe needs to go back to the drawing board.  It was a waste of good ingredients.  I even added more peanut butter and some Splenda to give them sweetness.  Nothing helped.
1800057548,505477,2013/9/12,5,"I like these. Think of a granola bar. I taste banana, peanut, chocolate. They are plenty sweet for me. I used 3 bananas do med size. Just getting brown spots. I cut them up and them mashed them with a potato masher. I added 1 heaping tblsp.  Real vanilla. I used natural very chunky peanut butter with no added sugar. I enjoy dark chocolate and do not like really sweet things. These met the criteria. Baked 10 min @ 350. Didn&#039;t stick on regular cookie sheet. Enjoy."
41917874,505477,2013/10/5,1,I am so glad I tasted these before taking to the church picnic! Too bitter!
3043569,505477,2013/12/15,0,Texture is like biting into a ball of stuffing.  Terrible taste!  I feel like I just wasted my time and the ingredients!  I tried one while it was still warm...yuck!  Waited until they were completely cool and tried another....the extra time did not make them taste any better!&lt;br/&gt;There is a bitter after taste to them...I expect the entire batch will be thrown out!
1802375343,505477,2014/6/2,0,"I hope that anyone thinking about making these, reads the reviews like I should have done before I wasted time and ingredients.  Ditto to all the other comments about these things.  I am throwing mine out.  They are horrible."
1802404831,506395,2014/1/24,5,"I am new to freshly milled flour. However, on my first try, these are the best waffles I have ever had hands down! Thanks for sharing! It&#039;s going to be a new family favorite."
161938,505477,2014/6/2,3,"not bad for a low-fat cookie.  i see others are saying they&#039;re bitter.  i suppose this is because the recipe doesn&#039;t specify dutched cocoa, and they&#039;re using plain old hershey&#039;s &quot;natural cocoa&quot;.  the recipe says &quot;dark&quot;, which isn&#039;t really a specific kind of cocoa.  i suspect the writer really intended for people to use the hershey&#039;s special dark, which is 50% dutched and 50% black cocoa, so that&#039;s what i used.  no bitterness here.-------- i also added 1/4 tsp salt and a tbsp or two of agave nectar since i&#039;m assuming the recipe creator used mainstream PB and apple sauce, and i used organic/freshly ground.  i would use a little bit more of each next time.  maybe 1/2 tsp and 1/8 cup respectively.---------- if i make these again, i do think i may substitute a tb or two of oil for some apple sauce.  (since they were slightly dry, and i&#039;m not an oil hater. i bet they&#039;d be great with coconut oil!)  they were better when they were flattened, since they don&#039;t spread, and the ones that remained as balls didn&#039;t cook all the way through, but that&#039;s a preference. if you like squishy oat balls, more power to you!  :-)  this also means you can crowd them on the pan with no issues.---------- i also think i might add peanuts to it since the cocoa was a bigger flavor than the other flavors. and what the heck, i may just replace the applesauce with another banana.  (this is starting to feel like a brand new recipe.)"
1802793640,505477,2014/6/3,1,"I made these because the ingredients were acceptable for a no sugar, no dairy, no flour, etc., lifestyle challenge that I&#039;m doing. The cookies were not very good, but were enough to take the edge off my chocolate/sweet craving. I&#039;d make them again for that purpose only."
500549,505477,2014/6/12,5,Seems the other reviewers on here were wanting your typical sweet cookie. Don&#039;t make this if you&#039;re going to compare it to refined-sugar-filled/flour (gluten) cookies and you are expecting it to be like that -- it&#039;s not a fair comparison and you won&#039;t like it. But if you take these cookies for what they are supposed to be -- wonderful at
1483882,505477,2014/6/29,1,"Do not make this recipe unless you want to waste time, ingredients and get a terrible taste when you try to eat them.  Terrible and I would never bake these cookies again.  Who in the world made this recipe up?"
1802921222,505477,2014/7/12,4,I didn&#039;t think they were bad coming right out of the oven. It will be a good healthy sub for a cookie.
9077464,505477,2014/7/14,0,"I pulled this recipe from a Facebook page the other day.  The picture showed beautiful shiny cookies that looked very good.  I bought the ingredients I didn&#039;t have and made them today.  I almost gagged when I bit into one.  This is one of the worst, dry not moist cookies as it appears on the FB page with a terrible, nasty taste.  I will not try it again."
1854740,505477,2014/7/28,0,"I guess I&#039;m not the only one that hated this recipe.  I was scheduled to be Cookie Buddy at church this morning.  So I bought the ingredients and made them.  It was horrible.  The picture made them look good, but I beg to differ.  I ended up at the store buying cookies for church.  This has to be a joke."
2000018503,505477,2015/2/23,3,"For me, while not a great cookie, these were not as bad as some reviewers experienced.  I did use unsweetened applesauce and Hershey&#039;s cocoa.  They weren&#039;t bitter.  I did use very ripe bananas and did really mix them up.  I did taste banana and cocoa.  They are better cold.  Again, not truly awful, but probably not a cookie I will do again (though I&#039;m not tossing the ones I have as they will give me that pop of something sweet if I need it)."
2000080570,505477,2015/3/22,1,Put some powdered sugar on top to try and help the taste but way too bitter! They looked so good.... too good to be true I guess. I reread the reciped 10 times to make sure I didn&#039;t do something wrong but... it was right. sorry.... these were aweful.
2000248981,505477,2015/6/5,1,"Nasty!!!!! Like eating a cocoa flavored Elmer&#039;s glue! Can&#039;t taste the peanut butter, vanilla or nothing. They just went in the garbage."
2000302843,505477,2015/6/29,1,I understand why this is a &quot;skinny&quot; recipe. You will not want anymore after the first bite.
2689448,495181,2013/2/11,5,"I ate these last night.  Very delicious, with a light, refreshing taste."
2690459,495181,2013/2/12,5,Delicious!!

2698452,495181,2013/2/18,5,OMG....Different & Delicious not your everyday taco. So nice to have an alternative for a great taco shell.  LOVED THEM!!!!
2699382,495181,2013/2/18,5,Loved it!
2700324,495181,2013/2/18,5,"Amazing recipe! Especially the provolone ""shells."" What a delicious idea!"
2700411,495181,2013/2/18,5,"This dish was so easy to make, but tastes like something that you slaved over for hours.  The provolone shells really make this recipe stand out from your typical tacos, and elevates the dish."
2700923,495181,2013/2/19,5,I can hardly wait to try this recipe!  Looks delicious!  Love the low carb option!
2701007,495181,2013/2/19,5,Absolutely amazing!  Bring on the next dinner party!
2701032,495181,2013/2/19,5,Yummmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!

2703702,495181,2013/2/20,5,Great recipe.  I will definitely be making this one again.
2704047,495181,2013/2/21,5,WoW!!!
2704502,495181,2013/2/21,5,Top shelf all the way !
2704627,495181,2013/2/21,5,6 stars would have been more appropriate but 5 will have to do
2704825,495181,2013/2/21,5,Delicious
174096,516300,2015/8/29,5,Great cookies! I love this type that doesn&#039;t use flour - so easy and delicious with just a few ingredients! Thanks for sharing. CQ2
169430,516300,2015/9/1,5,"I made 1 doz of these yummy cookies yesterday. I ate 3 and at that point realized that I had to get the rest in the freezer at once. Once I have something in the freezer my mind somehow resets to keep me from the &quot;just one more&quot; set to being able to take one or two and not missing what remains in the freezer and being able to have them for a long time. Ok, that said, YUM! Great cookies that are a snap to make up in a hurry. Love them. Made for Culinary Quest 2015."
157425,516300,2015/9/2,5,DH made these cookies for me and I loved them! He knows peanut butter cookies are my fav&#039;s but then to add chocolate chips....YUM! He will be making these great cookies again.  :) Made and reviewed for the Culinary Quest 2015.
895132,516300,2015/9/4,5,"My kind of cookie :) Easy to make, naturally gluten free and yummy. Thanks for sharing!
Made these for Culinary Quest 2015 / Texas BBQ and Beyond"
2000379600,507807,2015/9/28,1,"I was looking for just this sort of marinated chicken with crispy cornstarch batter, only to find that insufficient care was taken in preparing the recipe description, which contains multiple editing errors and no description of how to make the batter. Not even sure all the ingredients are really listed. 

Sure would appreciate a correction to the recipe."
2002067024,534855,2018/3/21,5,"Really really good! This was super easy, quick, and perfect for a cold day. I did add about 1/2 of a bell pepper, chopped. I didn't have tamari on hand, so I used about a tablespoon of maggi seasoning, but I think soy sauce would work fine. The spices were spot-on, and I did use the brown sugar. I used elbows, and 6 minutes had them too soft, so I'll do 5 minutes next time, with maybe a 15 minute release. We will definitely be making this again! Thanks dmac085 for sharing this recipe!"
386585,497272,2013/10/17,5,"This was a very nice recipe that is very similar to pot roast.  I had a thin-cut brisket, which still took the full 3 hours to come out fork-tender.  At first, I thought this would be too sweet, with the brown sugar and orange juice, but it ended up being very savory and flavorful.  It was even much better the next day!  There is plenty of sauce, which goes nicely over some mashed potatoes.  Made for My 3 Chefs October 2013."
2001713478,517798,2017/9/14,5,Made these twice already and they are great..really need too squeeze the zucchini very well or they won't hold together.
80353,503196,2013/8/31,5,Tart and refreshing and really quite different.  Never thought of using kumquat&#039;s in an &#039;ade&#039;.  Bought a tin of kumquats from Corfu (they&#039;re not in season yet).
2000135451,520680,2015/4/12,5,Nice and crunchy with the Frosted Flakes - very good as written.  I halved the recipe with one egg....also very good!
865936,495354,2013/3/1,3,This was just okay for me. I didn't much like the Pepsi flavor (and I love Pepsi).  The flavor did improve the next day.
128473,495354,2013/3/2,5,"We really enjoyed this black-eyed pea and ham casserole.  I made 1/2 the recipe, it was a perfect meal for two. It was absolutely delicious, full of layers of lovely robust flavors.  It was hot, sweet and spicy.  This dish  smelled great while cooking and tasted even better.  Sadly I can't say that it tasted better the next day, there was none left over.  I did cook this for 2 hours to allow it to reduce a bit (personal preference only).  It was a great use of contest ingredients, Good Luck."
2324285,493542,2013/1/28,5,"YUM!  This was my first time making cookies from scratch, and I couldn't be happier with the results.  Although not a healthy recipe, the lentils and oatmeal at least add some nutritional value- which is always nice.  The pumpkin seeds in particular taste superb inside the cookie, and although I liked the addition of chocolate chips, I was tempted to sub in dried cranberries instead...  Next time I just might do that.  These are also very filling, and a few cookies with a cup of tea or coffee would make a great breakfast.  Thanks for sharing this! [tagged and reviewed for Please Review My Recipe]"
1197744,493542,2013/5/25,5,"I have made these many times.  I am never one to follow recipes, but this I can get away with substituting a different nut or dried fruit for what the recipe calls for and they still, turn out great. I have even added some coco powder for some depth. I think next time I will try to omit the flour by using almond meal. I think chocolate chips are great in this."
1102236,496855,2016/3/13,0,"This has become one of my favorite lunch time meals. I make a pot on Sunday, and bring it to work all week. GREAT DISH!!"
80353,503749,2013/7/20,4,"Very nicely-flavoured portokalopita.  I did cut back to 1 tablespoon of baking powder because this does not &#039;rise&#039; like a conventional cakes does but, rather, stays flat, and I thought 2 tablespoons was overkill.  Instead of pushing some of the filo into the custard in the pan, I mixed half the filo with the custard in the bowl and then placed the rest on top, and that seemed to work nicely.  The syrup is delicious with its hint of orange-scented honey."
482376,506324,2014/4/15,5,"Yummy! This blended together beautifully. It&#039;s tangy and tasty. I will love having this in my salad dressing rotation. I halved the recipe and it made enough to last me two weeks, I think. Made for the Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef event in the contest and events forum."
516021,506324,2014/5/23,5,So glad I just made this! Yum! I always have all of these ingredients on hand too. Highly recommend this.
126440,506324,2014/5/25,5,I cut this down for two and was excellent with our Italian meal.
2002348219,507110,2018/11/25,5,"Hold the wagon. This is the best beef dish I've had in my entire life. WOW. If Jaimie Oliver visited Wyoming in 1918, this would've been the meal of choice for the governor. Fabulous flavor, incredible texture. And remember with brisket... 190 to 195 (for an extended time period) is WHEN the texture becomes melty and soft -- not lower than that. Counter-intuitive but important to remember! Enjoy this pure heaven."
2001041844,505819,2016/6/7,5,This cake was great tasting and very fun to make! I added cinnamon to the cake batter too. Turned out great!
169430,508952,2015/10/3,5,"I used a mixed baby lettuce bag and finally got to use a leaf cookie cutter set that I&#039;ve had for an age but only had used the tiny one for making pie crust dough leaves. Very pretty and tasty as well. What a great way to welcome Fall with some red, yellow and orange peppers.  For the dressing I used: http://www.food.com/recipe/basic-vinaigrette-201756.

Thanks much for this great idea and very tasty salad. :D"
2808681,498944,2013/7/14,4,Excellent recipe.  I substituted a lower carb Teriyaki sauce for 1 carb worth of sliced bamboo shoots.  I felt it added a new texture to the dish that everyone enjoyed.  I served it with brown rice for the non-carbwatchers in the family and everyone loved it!
187514,518033,2014/9/13,5,"I was very surprised how this recipe turned out!  It doesn&#039;t taste like heinze... IT&#039;S BETTER!  For smoking the tomatoes, I sauteed them over a wood fire in a 12&quot; skillet in batches for an hour.  It added a slight smoky flavor which was perfect.  Not too smoky, but subtly detectable.  I doubled the onion and garlic, and then followed the recipe.  It&#039;s a keeper if you have too many tomatoes from your garden.  I used brown sugar.  Much better alternative than GMO high fructose corn syrup that is in almost EVERYTHING today.  I am very pleased.  Thanks for posting this recipe."
2001167238,518033,2016/9/13,5,"I also found this recipe excellent. The only changes I made were to add molasses during the reduction and to use an immersion blender halfway through the reduction process. I also smoked 1/2 of the tomatoes with a combo of hickory,cherry and apple Woods."
2001703744,518033,2017/9/6,0,"Hi, I love everything about this recipe except for the vagueness about canning. Boiling water Bath? Pressure can? Thanks for any information."
2001712256,518033,2017/9/13,5,"Wellllllll....I kinda sorta followed this recipe. I didn't have peppercorns-actually I did, but THAT is way too much work. Also, no mustard seed, bay leaf, cloves, and pepper flakes. I also used Roma tomatoes for a thickness of the sauce. Finally, I'm too lazy to take the skins off, it's not like they're gonna kill ya. It came out perfect, the family L-O-V-E-D it. Here's to keeping it simple! Oh, I forgot, 6 lbs??? 2 pints??? I'm dealing with CRATES of tomatoes from the garden. I laugh in the face of 2 pints. Try 13 and that just for the catsup. (or Ketchup) :)"
2000023673,518033,2018/2/23,5,"Outstanding recipe, I have made this a few times using 10kg of cooking tomatoes (mainly roma). I have changed it up a few times adding several different ground chilli powders to amp it up. The latest is the standard recipe with soaked dry porch ini mushrooms. Also, the vinegar and sugar ratio needs to be changed, equal amounts of each. Cheers"
2001521247,518033,2018/6/6,4,This was my first attempt at ketchup. I think I did everything wrong but I still ended up with something that tasted good at the end. But my yield was only 1.5 pints even though I added some canned paste towards the end. It tastes good but I think I would prefer to not have the smoky taste.
131126,501013,2013/11/10,5,"I adapted this recipe to prepare the pork in the crockpot. I completely eliminated the 2 cups of water and cooked the pork until tender. After shredding I put it into a skillet and added the  oregano leaves, cumin, salt, pepper, vinegar and diced green chiles.    Instead of buttering the tortillas I simply softened them in the microwave before rolling. The chimichangas had great flavor and even froze well.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
853152,494768,2013/2/14,5,"We had to try this recipe, it had two different kinds of ranch, including our absolute favorite, Fiesta ranch! I've made Alfredo style past before,but the flavor in this was AMAZING! Yummy, rich and my whole family loved it. My 6 year old commented on how much he liked the ranch in it too. I can see how you could add veggies like broccoli or bell peppers to it and make it your own too. Definitely a keeper in our house!"
2694389,494768,2013/2/15,5,"I tried this flavorful recipe! This recipe was very easy to follow, the ingredients were easy to find and fairly inexpensive. The sauce was very creamy and flavorful, love the ranch flavors going on. The meatballs were moist and yummy!! Such an easy one dish meal you could easily add broccolli or some peppers to this dish or serve with a garden salad!! Love it!"
2706644,494768,2013/2/22,0,I had this recipe tonight for dinner and it was AWESOME!!! way too awesome!
2706664,494768,2013/2/23,5,My family and I had this delicious meal with a side salad for dinner tonight and all I can say is Wow!!!!!  The Hidden Valley Original Ranch and Hidden Valley Fiesta Ranch bring out the tasty bold flavor in the creamy sauce. The meatballs were so tender and juicy that they literally melt in your mouth. This is one recipe that will be used in our home often and for years to come. It definitely deserves a five star rating.
2707132,494768,2013/2/23,5,"Last night we had the opportunity to try this recipe and it was a heavenly, the ranch sauce had this awesome effect to it and the meatball was tender and juicy. The meal was filling and really appetizing. I will love to use this recipe for my next get together since my entire family had a blast tasting it. Great job Becky Lo!"
2708332,494768,2013/2/23,0,I tried this dish at a dinner party and it was absolutely delicious  I loved the extra creamy alfredo sauce and the two different kinds of ranch made it very flavorful. The meatballs were so tender they seemed to melt in my mouth.  Definitely a very tasty recipe that I will try again.
2710220,494768,2013/2/24,5,I tried this recipe tonight and I thought it tasted wonderful! The Ranch made it very flavorful! The combination of noodles and meatballs was perfect. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!
2709851,494768,2013/2/24,5,I absolutely love how much flavor the meatballs have with the fiesta ranch seasoning! They taste so light but are so flavorful at the same time.. definitly keeping this as a regular recipe to make! Big plus that they are made with greek yogurt too - it makes me feel good to be eating something healthy.
2707951,494768,2013/2/24,0,I loved this dish....i know the cook herself and she made it for me and the meatballs were perfect super moist. had the taste of spicy but without the heat. i love that. i dont care for spicy dishes. and the alfredo sauce oh my gosh!! i just loved it. Superb!! would definitely make this for myself.
2710345,494768,2013/2/24,5,"I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! The soft meatballs combined with the creamy sauce and pasta together with the Ranch was amazing! The Ranch certainly took this dish to the next level,and we all wanted seconds! The kids loved it too!! I am already planning to make it again with some veggies. Very yummy!"
2711698,494768,2013/2/25,5,"I tried this recipe and the meatballs were unbelievably tender and unique tasting. A very delicious and different dance this flavor did in my mouth!<br/>The fresh pasta was a plus in relation to normal, everyday pasta.<br/>A recipe that will be remembered and relished by all who prepare it!"

381180,512385,2014/4/18,5,"Asparagus is my favorite vegetable, and this was delicious!  Loved the garlic; I probably used about 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves and that was plenty for me, as I had never added thyme to asparagus before!  Tagged for Spring PAC 2014."
266635,494723,2013/3/7,4,"We really enjoyed this dish; especially the smoky paprika-spiced oil.  The spices really complimented the tomatoes and chickpeas and of course, the chicken.  Liked the addition of the blue cheese as it added a nice touch to the roasted tomatoes.  It's really a complete meal with the peppery arugula, but we did serve it along with another veggie.  Made for PRMR, March, 2013."
80353,505524,2013/8/26,5,OMG Fantastic!  The finished glaze on these ribs is so scrumptious with a lot umami happening.  A keeper for sure.
266635,505524,2013/9/6,5,"Delicious short ribs!  Made as directed except that I used boneless short ribs -- the trade off is less fat, but probably missed out on some flavor that the bones would have provided.  Loved the peanut butter glaze and the crushed peanuts.  Served over brown rice.  Made for PRMR, September, 2013."
2324285,512204,2014/1/28,5,"A very tasty Thai-flavored soup.  Light and delicious, and I loved the amount of veggies.  I used shitake mushrooms and extra firm tofu, and served over rice noodles."
994712,511114,2014/1/20,5,Very tasty and very easy to make.  I sometimes add a can of chickpeas or white kidney beans to it.
2500830,511114,2018/3/24,5,"Made today, first time, after searching for a chicken &amp; quinoa dish. I didn't think there were enough directions provided for the quinoa. So, I followed directions on the package, which meant rinsing raw quinoa &amp; covering it while simmering. I added about 1/2 c. leftover canned black beans I had. I also use a very low sodium broth so have to add fresh ground pink Himalayan salt back in. I didn't think there was enough broth so added about another cup with the chicken. Also used dried parsley, not fresh. This was a tasty recipe &amp; a great alternative to chicken &amp; rice soup."
131126,495313,2013/3/2,4,The elements of this recipe were nice and we had a very enjoyable meal.  My biggest problem was the texture of the meatballs.  They were almost too soft to form and sort of melted into a single meat patty in the oven.  I did use ground turkey so maybe it had extra moisture.  They were well seasoned though and tasted great. The sauce had a nice contrast with neither sweet nor sour being overpowering.  It was pale in color and the amount of cornstarch thickened it instantly.  Next time I will add chunks of onion and bell pepper when adding the pineapple and reduce the cornstarch. I also appreciated the garnishes at the end.  I like pretty.  Thank you for sharing the recipe and good luck!
2002327940,524054,2018/11/11,0,"Fabulous.. thank you very much.. ate this in Florence recently and absolutely loved it.. carried some home , but making it will be even more delightful."
47892,499356,2013/5/14,5,"Local goat cheese, local heavy cream, locally grown Italian parsley and a wee bit of cilantro. Perfect! We tried a wonderful goat cheese from a local goat farm and I made this breadto accompany: Recipe #235909. Reviewed for NA*ME tag/May."
37449,499356,2014/6/2,5,"This was delicious! I used almond milk instead of cream, just used a little less. Thanks!"
2000096247,498593,2017/3/12,5,This is a great recipe my son in law makes this close to same way. I crave it now it is so good.used jar of green chilies hot and little more garlic.
679953,506072,2014/1/25,5,"Breakfast for dinner tonight..   Loved the glaze, and for the milk, I used 2%.  Very nice waffles, though this was my fault, I left myself a mess to clean.  Nothing to do with the recipe.  :).  Made for Holiday Tag."
400708,506072,2014/3/4,5,"Easy &amp; delicious, this is one I can&#039;t wait to make for our Grand kids, they&#039;ll love it. The glaze if so good, I used 2% milk &amp; real maple syrup.  I used a Belgium waffle maker so had no problem with them being to thick, it was perfect.  But would tell folks to make sure they spray the waffle maker well to prevent sticking, my first 2 came out perfect, the the later ones tended to stick until I resprayed."
1802858380,516977,2014/11/5,5,These were awesome. Very nice combination or ranch and hot taste
852554,502760,2013/8/10,5,"Very good - I halved the recipe with one can of well-rinsed canned black beans.  Since my beans were canned, I omitted the salt.  To spice them up, next time I will add a fresh diced jalapeno!  Made for ZWT 9"
480195,503063,2013/8/8,5,What a delicious drink! It sure went down easy. We will make these again.
1620171,507250,2013/10/6,4,"This was very nice, as you can see from my photo, I didn&#039;t end up making pops, as silly me has no icy pop moulds, so I decided to go with a more &#039;ice cream&#039; approach. I left out the bananna since the smell of it makes me ill, so my attempt is certainly not the best one to judge by. The remaining flavours all were lovely, though I suspect the banana would have given it a more creamy texture. Note, if you do decide to just put in a container and freeze, you will need more than 4 hours for it to freeze. Made for My Food Odyssey October 2013"

2001069391,516905,2016/7/20,0,Just read the nutritional info. One net carb per serving. Very high in calories.
2002095974,516905,2018/4/4,5,Very good. Next time I won't use the salt as this batch was a bit salty but I haven't had bread in so long it didn't matter. Lol
2671106,494484,2013/2/1,5,This is an easy yummy recipe that wows the guests. If you don't have time to get to the asian market to get the sriracha sauce you could leave it out (although it would be a shame) or substitute something like sweet chill sauce if you like.
2675113,494484,2013/2/3,5,Will definitely try this for the shrimp-loving friends!  It has a beautiful presentation.
2676614,494484,2013/2/3,5,"I made these for a Super Bowl party and they were a huge hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe, very tasty!"
2678080,494484,2013/2/4,5,Colorful and tasty appetizer. WOW!
226863,504034,2014/12/7,5,Fabulous!  I doubled the sausage and was delited!  This could be a main dish and not a side.  My son really loved this and has asked me to make it again.  So it will be a repeat!  Thanks for sharing.....made for &quot;for your consideration&quot; tag game.
227978,522942,2016/7/19,5,"Oh wow, this is a really great cocktail. It's slightly sweet, but mostly it's refreshing and fruity that's similar to (well it's a challenge to describe, and I might be off a bit here) a tangy passion fruit juice drink. It's so delicious, and I'll make this again. I had a really hard time finding yuzu juice (and I wasn't about to attempt a search for fresh yuzu fruit). So I tried a substitute suggested by an online site (using 3 tbsp fresh lime juice and 1/2 tbsp orange juice), and it was OK. But I finally found some yuzu juice after searching online for shops in my area, and it's great both ways but I definitely like the one with yuzu juice. It's has a pleasant citrus tone. I think I'll be sipping on these all summer long. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 (Japan). Thanks for sharing your recipe, momaphet."
695933,506221,2013/10/14,5,"We are in love with this one with the caramel and vanilla vodka. I could use one more  now. This one has Fall/Autumn written all over it, one that makes you want to cuddle in front of a warm fire, one that makes you want slow down your pace, one that makes you want to invite your friends over for a warm dinner. This isn&#039;t a cocktail for the lightweights! THANK YOU! PRMR 2013....Grpa"
266635,504034,2018/8/28,5,"We loved the flavors in this potato salad. The andouille was a nice addition, but the cream sauce with the creole mustard was what really made this dish. Will definitely make this again."
1064524,494950,2013/6/20,5,These are great.  I have used honey instead of the brown rice syrup.  I keep them freezer and they are a great snack!
1680722,506136,2014/4/9,5,"This is an easy and tasty version of lemon pound cake.&lt;br/&gt;No Greek lemon yogurt here, so I used simply used Greek yogurt for this recipe.&lt;br/&gt;The cake is juicy, fresh and tasty. Exactly what you are looking for.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for posting here your recipes!"
2001022142,526717,2016/5/23,5,"Splendid. Simply splendid. What a wonderful gift, to be able to continue to enjoy a sauce that is no longer commercially available. This recipe is just as good, and perhaps even better, than the original! Thank you!"
2209112,515122,2014/4/17,0,These were super creamy and flavorful
461834,502909,2013/8/9,5,"What a yummy cake!!!  It definitely has a nice rum flavor, as the name states!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe and used my bread/loaf pan to bake it in and toasted the pecans and served them as a topping, as I am the only one who likes those nuts.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
526666,502909,2013/8/11,5,"Fab-U-Lous! I cheated and just soaked the syrup into the cake; who needs ice cream? Not us! The cake is moist and tropical, but the dark rum gives it a subtle edge over other rum cakes I&#039;ve made/tasted! Oh, my pan was an 8 X 8 glass dish and it worked out just fine, with no adjustments. Thanks for sharing, CaliforniaJan!"

2203793,514445,2014/3/21,5,Loved this!  Who knew sweet potatoes and pulled pork would be this delicious in a quesadilla!
1802636110,514967,2014/4/1,5,Potatoes and Brie have had a crush on each other for years. Finally THEY ARE TOGETHER!
1802636254,514967,2014/4/1,5,I love this recipe!! Apples and Brie....yummm :) made it for lunch today and it turned out perfect. It&#039;s a must-try for sure
1802641343,514967,2014/4/4,5,Tried this for my husband last night...always been a fan of granny smith apples and brie so adding potatoes and caramelized onions really made this superb!  Will for sure make again with company!
2549237,514370,2014/5/6,5,This reminded me of chicken cordon bleu kind of.  It was very good and pretty easy to make.  It was gobbled up by everyone in my house and I was asked today if I would make it again this weekend.  That surely states a very good meal in this house.  Thank you for another winner ForeverMama!

1802625199,514967,2014/4/6,5,"I&#039;m really getting into these potato stacks.  They are a great idea that I have never thought of.  Always looking for recipes I haven&#039;t thought of.  Tried another chef&#039;s potato stack yesterday and this one was completely different and fantastic.  It was decadent, creamy, and delicious.  I actually added a thin slice of brie to the top to melt and was very pleased with that addition."
1802649746,514967,2014/4/7,5,Love this recipe. It&#039;s going to be my new go to from now on
498271,511463,2014/4/16,4,This was a nice tasty quiche!  I used mozzarella for the cheese.  At the time of this review the amount of basil wasn&#039;t specified so I used 1 teaspoon of dried and thought that was just right.  Mine took about 45 minutes to bake and I used your recipe #511448 for the crust.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2014
1783373,513394,2017/2/26,4,"The lime and garlic marinade was a good start to adding flavor to this fish. I used salmon because I had it in the freezer and wanted to use it up. The poblano sauce is mild and creamy, so I added a bit of garlic powder. Next time, I will added some jalapeno to add a bit of spice. Overall it was an enjoyable dish and the 15 minute baking time was spot on to making this fish perfectly tender. Thank you Nancy for sharing. Made it for FYC."
47892,502820,2013/7/11,5,"We received two heads of cabbage in our CSA box-one head of napa and a standard one. I used the latter for this recipe and switched out red bell for green and made sure to use a vegetarian-based Worcestershire sauce (Annie&#039;s brand). I also added one stalk of celery with leaves (finely minced) and red onion for additional color. This went really well with our Indian tacos for dinner! Made for our VIP for Veg Tag/July. Thanks, Mikekey!"
400708,502820,2013/7/14,4,"This made for a truly different, spicy and great tasting cole slaw.  I easied it up by using a bag of ready mixed cole slaw but other than that followed the directions exactly.  Loved the spicy flavor and it was a hit with DH which is always a good thing.  Made for ZWT9 Regional Cajun leg"
305531,502820,2013/7/19,5,This was really good. I loved the tang from the mustard. I started out with a coleslaw mix and this went together quickly. Thanks Mikekey for a nice new coleslaw treat. Made for ZWT9.
37449,502820,2013/7/24,4,"I enjoyed this slaw, but did add some honey to my taste. Different and a nice change. Thanks!"

212609,508541,2013/11/29,5,Simplicity never tasted SO good....!!!&lt;br/&gt;What&#039;s not to love about this?!!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR
724631,508541,2014/4/11,4,"Tasty, very hammy sandwiches.  I think it would still be generously hammy with 1/4 lb. deli ham between the 2 sandwiches.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
482933,514340,2014/8/7,5,Nice and cheesy just the way we like it. Like the jalape&ntilde;o and tomato slices on top-jazzes up color. Gratin gives it some crunch. I used one third the salt and subbed in one fresh jalape&ntilde;o for the jarred. Thanks for posting.
496803,503289,2013/7/23,4,"We really enjoyed this, but couldn&#039;t give it five stars.  While the seasoning was good (in the meatball), it really needed to be at least doubled to really carry the flavors through to the finished product. For the yogurt sauce we had a similar issue, we liked it but would have liked the flavor to be more pronounced.  Either making it early in the day and letting it sit, or adding more seasoning was the general consensus.  Also, (not part of the rating) choose a strong pita that will hold up to being filled without falling apart. The arugula was a brilliant choice for a green component- it has lots of flavor on its own, and the slight bitterness is a good foil for the fattiness of the lamb and yogurt.  Made for ZWT9."
39835,503289,2014/3/6,4,Very good and a change from the typical meatball sandwich. I forgot the arugula but otherwise made as directed. Served with fruit for a super easy meal. Thanks for sharing!
60124,503147,2014/1/9,5,"this dish had a great WOW factor! Made as written to go with recipe#399253.  Though I did add a little mint, as it was tangled with the basil :) &lt;br/&gt;I have never &quot;grated&quot; a tomato, so I used one fresh and a little canned, diced tomato. I will definately make this again! made for Aussie swap, Jan 2014"
2811146,499517,2013/5/3,5,"I LOVE this recipe, they turned out mouth watering.  I did make a few minor adjustments though. I made my macaroons heaping Tablespoon sized instead of 1/4 cup like it called for, that seems VERY large plus, that would only allow you to make like 8 macaroons before you would run out of mixture. I doubled this recipe and even making mine smaller in size only ended up with 24 macaroons. These are VERY yummy and super quick and easy too. I would just double or even triple this recipe and make the macaroons tablespoon size. Even though I made mine much smaller that the recipe called for they turned out good sized. I will definitely be making these again soon!"
1889976,499517,2013/5/26,5,There is a mistake in the instructions. When I got out the 1/4 cup to measure the macaroons I realized that was way too much and wouldn&#039;t make 18 macaroons.  I used a tablespoon to measure each one and I had exactly 18.  They turned out perfectly in the amount of baking time specified.  Everybody loved them!
1628197,499517,2013/6/10,5,"Super easy, chewy, and delicious.  I used tablespoon scoop, and the recipe made about 24 macaroons.  Even without dipping in chocolate (which I also tried), my family raved about them.  This is my new favorite cookie recipe."
1802577384,499517,2014/3/13,0,These are awesome!  I agree the scoop should be more like a Tablespoon but any way you make them they are wonderful!!  SO easy and delicious - my family loves them!
1802654958,499517,2014/4/9,5,I made this recipe and my husband raved that this was the best coconut macaroons he had ever had.  The recipe is so easy and quick to make.  My husband like them with and without the added chocolate topping.
2000434941,516081,2015/8/28,5,Delicious flavor but slightly salty!  Would alter salt to 1/2 teaspoon. And I&#039;m usually a salt freak. The meatballs had a beautiful crunch on the outside with soft tender meat inside. 20 mins at 400 degrees was perfect. Definitely do want to use foil lined pan as the olive oil will leak out of the balls. I might try the Alton Brown method of cooking meatballs with this recipe (put them in mini muffin pans which heats evenly and also maintains their round shape).
2001516324,516081,2017/5/1,5,"This recipe is great for young children because there are not too many spices, it is very moist on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside. I served it with white rice and my one and three-year old gobbled it up. I made the following adjustments: Replaced asiago and mozzarella for ricotta cheese. Mixed the ricotta with the egg, then added it to the rest of the ingredients. Salted to my own taste. Put the meat in Greek yogurt cups and dumped them on the foil lined baking sheet."
2724582,524973,2015/12/2,5,Delicious recipe!  Love the flavor combination!

865936,502733,2013/7/21,4,"I&#039;ve made eggs in this manner before, but never with the cheese.   That is new and welcome.   It sort of insulates the yolks if you put it on right. If you want your yolks runny be sure to remove from the pan as soon as the whites are set."
286566,502733,2013/8/11,5,"I only made 1 egg and served with toasted wholegrain/wholemeal bread and enjoyed every mouthful, I used a sharp cheddar cheese and the white was beautifully cooked and the yolk nice running, just how I like it, thank you morgaingeiser, made for New Kid on the Block tag game."
128473,502733,2013/11/20,5,"What a lovely way to serve eggs.  I enjoyed it very much.  I used Jarslberg cheese, it worked beautifully in this recipe.  I served the egg on a hot peice of Naan Bread it made a wonderful lunch. Thanks for sharing morgainegeiser."
80353,513724,2014/9/20,5,"This would be a smashing success at a dinner party - so healthy and pretty!  The cranberry-pear compote was delicious, and the walnuts gave a really nice &#039;crunch&#039; to add another texture.  Served kale chips alongside.  Dinner was great."
1802629039,514877,2014/3/30,5,Wowzers! Who thought a sorbet could be this amazing
1802632515,514877,2014/3/31,5,"This is such a simple, amazing recipe! Love, love, love!!"
1706426,507305,2013/10/5,4,"What a great idea! I USED APPLEWOOD SMOKED HAM AND DEFINITELY ADDED A UNIQUE FLAVOR. tHANKS FOR SHARING, MADE FOR mY tHREE cEFS, 2013"
461834,510104,2014/5/22,5,"What a wonderful switch from our standard stuffing!!!  Loved the added bacon flavor, but I always think that bacon makes everything better, lol!!!  I made 1/4 of the recipe and served it with roasted chicken thighs, mashed taters/gravy and corn, yummy!!!  I didn&#039;t have the fresh herbs so did sub dried, but otherwise, made as written.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
2001330613,515687,2018/4/29,4,"These were a nice low carb meal. Perhaps it was my ratios, but they seemed a bit dry."
144373,502029,2013/7/21,5,"These shrimp kabobs are delicious, even it they are healthy, with using the smart balance buttery spread.   My family loved the flavor of the creole butter on the shrimp.  The only changes I made was one: I doubled the recipe and two: I only used 1/8 teaspoon of ground red pepper, so for me the heat was mild , which is just right.  My family does like hot stuff, but I need to eat it also, other than those two changes I made the recipe as written.  Made for ZWT9 - The Apron String Travelers for the Holy Trinity Challenge."
2001074217,517222,2016/7/4,5,"So easy and so good! I had picked up some of these Asian turnips at a farmers market yesterday and wasn't sure what to do with them but this what's the answer! Easy enough to remember, so a definite repeat recipe for me!"
232047,495386,2013/2/27,5,"The taste of these is wonderful and the texture is perfect. They were a great compliment to the soup I made. I divided the dough into 8 bowls. However, they were much smaller than I wanted so I think next time I will try dividing the dough into 4 instead. Overall, I am very pleased with this recipe and I will definitely be making them again."
131126,495386,2013/4/19,5,"Although these didn&#039;t turn out  for the use I had in mind, my husband voluntarily told me not to lose the recipe. He liked both the prevalent yeasty taste and texture.  That makes them a hit in my book any day!  The bread rose beautifully and has a chewy texture with a lovely crust.  All positives.  I had planned to use these as bowls for a BLT salad. The finished product turned out the size of small hamburger buns and was too small for that purpose.  I think in order to use as an actual bowl for a soup or salad the bread would need to be thicker; maybe only make half the bowls with the full amount of dough.  Made for Spring Safari 2013 Pick A Chef."
2871999,495386,2013/6/21,5,These were absolutely fabulous!. I made no changes at all. So soft and puffy. Have made them 6 times as bread bowls and rolls. If you had trouble getting your bread to rise then let it sit in the warm water a little. I put all the ingredients but the flour in my kitchenade. Let it mix on 1 for about a minute. (make sure the water is warm enough) Then I added the flour 1 cup at a time and mixed. Keep mixing for 8 min AFTER you add all the flour. Take out of your kitchenade form into a ball. Wrap tightly in saran wrap and watch it explode quite literally.  It made 10 large breadbowls or 24 rolls.
814950,495386,2013/9/22,5,"Friday I made my Creamy Potato Leek soup and wanted to add a little extra yum to dinner so I made these bread bowls. The recipe is easy, tasty and pretty quick to make. I will make them again but I will make them larger for dinner. The recipe as it stands is great for serving dips or lunch size portions of soup."
128473,495386,2014/4/23,5,"After reading the other reviews, I decided to make half a batch, which I promptly made into two large bread bowls, they were the perfect size for our spicy lentil soup. They rose beautifully, large, tall and round like a ball. The bread was quick and easy to make, with a nice flavor, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It stood up beautifully to the soup.  Thank you for sharing your recipe. Made for Spring Pac 2014."
400708,495386,2014/11/6,5,"Can&#039;t tell you how long I&#039;ve been searching for this exact recipe.  It&#039;s harder than you think to find one that not only comes out looking right but holds up to the soup you put inside AND taste great too.  Well this is it!  That said I did read the other reviews and while I made the recipe exactly as listed - I did make only 4 bowls and they were perfect in size.  I impressed everyone, including myself.  Filled mine with loaded potato soup and it was perfect for this cool fall day.  I&#039;ve found the perfect recipe and thank you so much for posting"
2774031,495386,2014/12/31,5,"Definitely a success, and that is saying something for me!  Made into four bowls, and they held up great for broccoli cheese soup.  I would make these as smaller dinner rolls as well.  This recipe is a keeper!"
126440,495386,2015/1/20,5,Never had or made one before and they turned out great.  Used for a wild rice and mushroom soup.  Made half the recipe and made two bowls.
1803716867,495386,2015/3/17,5,"This was amazing!!!!! They worked perfectly for our creamy vegetable soup, and I will definitely use this again! My family absolutely LOVED them! This is the first bread bowl recipe I&#039;ve ever made, and I&#039;m not trying any others! Thanks sooooooooo much for the recipe!"
1632312,495386,2015/11/15,5,"WOW.  I will sometimes try to make a smaller batch of a new recipe (just in case...), so I did cut this recipe in half.  It took a little more flour than the scaled amount called for.  I ended up with approximately 24 oz of raw dough after the first rise, so made 3 rolls of approximately 8 oz each.  Otherwise I followed the directions to the letter and could not have been more pleased.  Great taste, clear instructions, an easy dough to work with, perfect bread bowls.  Now if I just had some soup on hand.  I was hoping to make soup and bread bowls for visiting relatives this winter, and this recipe is a home run!  Thanks for posting it!"
1802849661,495386,2015/12/15,4,"Great dough! Easy to work with and rose really well. However, they were a little small. I followed the recipe and made them the size of tennis balls, but if I made these again I would definitely make the bread bowls bigger, so I could serve a larger amount of soup in them. Tasted great though!"
2000865183,495386,2016/2/8,0,"I made these yesterday. Great success. I first shaped rolls into 6 rolls (3 per tray) I let them over rise :(. But decided to pound down again and shpaed this time into 8 rolls. Once raised in about 45 min they raised to the perfect individual soup bowl, and baked about 18 min. Awesome! Served beef stew inside and got raves. This recipe is a keeper!"
2001238469,495386,2016/11/9,5,This recipe made excellent bread bowls...it might have been me but I needed to add more flour to it. The bread bowls turned out fluffy and delicious...I had made homemade split pea soup that we spooned into the bowls...using this recipe for hamburger buns too! Versatile and easy!
2001284573,495386,2016/12/6,5,"Loved these, but just before baking I drizzled melted butter over the top and sprinkled with garlic salt. Used this for beef barely soup and it was perfect"
2001288755,495386,2017/1/5,5,I followed other reviewers' comments and made 4 very large bread bowls instead of 8. Next time I might make 6 in order to make the dough go further. Each bowl held 2 cups of soup. They were easy to make and stood up well to the soup. Might experiment with adding whole wheat flour as well. Will make again!
2001457464,495386,2017/3/26,4,"Regarding portions, if one tries to make 8 bread bowls from 4 cups of flour you will end up with bread &quot;cups&quot;. Please figure 1 cup of flour for each bread bowl."
690623,527481,2016/7/28,5,I loved this salad! The dressing reminds me so much of one that dresses the salads of my favourite Japanese restaurant. It is a definite keeper!
1802425317,492888,2014/1/28,4,hi they were very good but i have one question when do you put in the vanilla.
1680722,503475,2014/3/15,5,"Today we had a late breakfast and we found that it would nice to have something smaller for lunch. After a short search in Kato&#039;s recipe I found that this is the perfect recipe.&lt;br/&gt;I prepared this this for 4 peoples and we all enjoyed it very much ... it was so good in 15 minutes all was gone!&lt;br/&gt;The recipe was perfect, the dough had the right consistence even after the minor change I did using milk instead of cream.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this dessert/snack! :)"
227978,503475,2017/8/29,5,"My goodness, this is one delicious baked pancake. The cinnamon/sugar mixture was just enough to sweeten the apples but not so sweet as to make it seem like a dessert. I bought enough apples to make a whole batch, but my apple supply seemed to have mysteriously dwindled to only 2 when it was time to make this recipe. So I made 1/3 recipe and baked it in my small (8-inch) cast iron skillet, and it made enough for 3 large portions (could even get by with 4 portions for smaller appetites). I have a hot spot in my oven and I kept turning my skillet to keep it from browning too fast. Despite my efforts, the edge all around seemed to have scorched a tad. But nonetheless it still tasted wonderful. I'd happily serve this Danish Apple Pancake to company or even for a special occasion, because it's much better than a plain pancake and makes breakfast a special occasion. Thanks, Baby Kato. Made for Culinary Quest 2017 (Scandinavia)."
128473,533649,2018/11/7,5,"Wow, was this ever good Bonnie. I knew I would enjoy it, I just didn't realize how much. Thank you for sharing this warm, delicious treat; it was quick and easy to make. I can't wait to have this again. I can still taste the apples, maple syrup, pecans and cheese... Yummm Made for Autumn Fever."
2200666,495923,2013/2/20,5,I love the flavor combination you created here with so few ingredients!!!  Amazing and sounds wonderful!!!

2002200210,504457,2018/8/15,0,Wonderful soup
1290504,505658,2013/9/21,5,Quick &amp; delicious!! Dear BF loved them!! Wonderful and easy afternoon snack!!
1800695346,505658,2013/12/12,5,"I cut biscuits in half, flattened, put pepperoni in center then added a bit of shredded cheese and folded biscuit up. I also mixed topping before sprinkling over top. spread out over a cookie sheet and cooked for about 12 minutes. Turned out great! Thanks!"
339260,505658,2014/4/8,5,Very fast and easy to make.  I rolled out each biscuit first then stretched them out by hand a little and laid 5 pepperoni pieces in an overlapping circle and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.  These little bundles look delicious and taste great too.  Dipped in the warm marinara...Mmmmmmmmmmm!   Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2014.
2585084,505785,2013/9/3,4,This was a simple and quick recipe way to prepare parsnips.  Onions were mentioned in the directions but not in the ingredients list. I chopped one small onion and cooked it until translucent. This was a very tasty side dish.
163112,505785,2013/10/16,4,Delicious but they didn&#039;t hold their shape.  Next time I would cut into &#039;coins&#039; for better control over cooking.  They looked more mushy than glazed but were delicious!  Made for Traveling through Tunisia in the NA/ME Forum 10/2013.
1442702,498984,2013/8/6,5,Had this at my daughter&#039;s (McGelby).  Loved it &amp; and asked her to post so I could have it.  She used corn from the cob when she made this batch.  Chocked full of protein and great flavor.
1803194261,505658,2014/10/3,3,"Like others have said this recipe is very simple and fun to make with the kiddos, but it&#039;s just too much biscuit and little filling. The dough is a bit overwhelming. You really can&#039;t layer on cheese and pepperoni as much as you&#039;d like because it&#039;ll overstuff and won&#039;t be able to fold over the biscuits. It&#039;s a neat idea, but there are other alternatives to pizza rolls. I tried it once but will skip this from now on."
482376,512299,2014/2/10,5,"Outstanding!!!! This goes straight to the top of my best-of-the-best cookbook. I loved the method and the resulting flavors are incredible. It was so easy, too! This recipe is not only a keeper, but will be put into regular rotation. Thank you for posting this gem."
2399085,512299,2014/2/12,5,"Made for PRMR!!!! This was very garlicky, good thing I love garlic. I enjoyed this so much I think I will make it again next week. Thanks so much for this garlicky recipe!"
135470,512299,2014/3/26,3,"Made as directed; this was tasty, but for all the extra work really no different than just roasting. I found the skin was crispy after frying, but was less crisp coming out of the oven, where as the skin is usually very crispy when I just roast it. Made for PRMRT"
527607,512299,2014/6/9,5,"Update, made again on a hot day and it was even better. Incredibly good for such a simple recipe. It takes longer to peel the garlic than anything else. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and it still came out great"
246173,512299,2018/6/10,5,"I've been making this a long time (since I saw it on TV years ago) and it's a hit everytime. Get the herbs de provence - it's worth it! Also, peeled garlic from Trader Joe's is a great shortcut. The secret to the sauce is spoon the fat out of the pan first - you only need 1 to 2 tablespoons with the drippings."
616152,521475,2015/4/20,5,"I couldn&#039;t wait to try this when I saw it first posted! I don&#039;t like regular lasagna since I&#039;m not a fan of hamburger meat, so I am always on the lookout for a different take on it. This did not disappoint! I was a little confused on the directions since it said to add sugar, but it was not listed as an ingredient. I did add a teaspoon of white sugar since we prefer a sweeter sauce. We also prefer a smooth, not chunky sauce, so I emulsified it in my Nutri Bullet. It came out rich and absolutely delicious! I will double and use the sauce recipe again the next time I make pizza. I prepared this as &quot;roll-ups&quot;. It was definitely time consuming, but I prepared it earlier in the day and just popped it in the oven an hour before dinner. I can imagine this would be a great kid-friendly dish! Thanks so much for this fun and different recipe!!! We can&#039;t wait until leftovers tomorrow night!"
895132,499065,2014/4/19,4,"These are quite nice, healthy and very easy. The banana flavour is quite strong, and the baked brownies are a bit flat in taste. To tell the truth, I liked the raw dough better than the baked brownie, it&#039;s like a gooey, yummy banana-chocolate dip. I think I&#039;ll make it again and eat the whole thing raw :) Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
2000196477,511737,2015/5/10,5,I tasted these on a recent wine tour. So tasty this is the recipe i found. I think they needed to be baked a few more minutes. First batch never regained its crunch. Second batch was a hit!
2001556524,511737,2017/5/27,5,"These are GREAT! I also added time to make them crunchy again. I felt the coating was a little to light, unlike the whiskey stick I have bought out at the wineries. So I did a batch and a half of the coating mix and increased the cooking time."
143318,493599,2013/3/3,5,Outstanding combination of flavors! Meatless Monday might be Mushroom Monday every week from now on. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo and it was a very tasty sauce - would also make a good creamy salad dressing.
486725,493599,2014/5/2,5,"Way better than any meat burger I&#039;ve ever had! I think all the flavors come together nicely in this, but I think the &quot;secret&quot; ingredient is the method of grilling the portabellos - it gives them such a great taste. We also opted to grill one red pepper (for 2 burgers) instead of using jarred, and I would highly recommend that. I added less mustard for my taste. These made a delicious meal!"
1179225,493599,2014/6/27,5,Yum!! Super tasty. Forgot to butter the buns and saved a few calories. These are really quick to prepared and so flavorful. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.
2001836683,503584,2018/9/9,0,"Where is the recipe, for the sauce??????"
107135,503657,2013/7/15,5,wow i cut this down to 1 serving and wish i had made the whole thing. the green onions are genius .i had never had them with black  eyed  peas before.thats how im going eat them from now on. nice dish that is freezer bound zwt9
37449,503657,2013/7/22,5,Yummy! I used vegetarian sausage and it turned out great. Thanks! Made for ZWT#9 2013 for Hot Stuff.
266635,503657,2018/8/16,5,I'm a southern gal and we love our blackeyed peas here. They were delicious and such a wonderful comfort food for us. The only change is made was to add a can of rotel chilies &amp; tomatoes to spice them up a bit.
37636,503657,2018/8/23,5,Very tasty! I did add extra water as you suggested. I also used a fresh andouille instead of a smoked andouille since it was what I had and it tastes delish.
542159,503657,2018/9/1,4,Oops I forgot the green onions! I made these for DH who was very pleased and said you can make these again. Thanks for the post.
12263035,492943,2014/5/22,5,"I saw this on TV with America&#039;s Test Kitchen. It looked good, but I was not a subscriber online. Thank you for posting. I followed the recipe, but my brisket was a little larger, and I adjusted the quantities. After 4 hours, I uncovered it and the smell was so enticing, I slipped a piece onto my fork to try before cooling. It is not too sweet, but with a tangy layered flavor. Mouthfeel is meltingly smooth. I used Heinz catsup (my fave). Do try this at home. I will use it in pita bread with maybe a spoonful of giardinere."
1783373,503659,2016/8/21,5,"Paul Delios is from the same state that I’m from and having his cookbook in my wish list on Amazon (waiting for the price to go down), meant that I had to try it. The instructions on the placement of the skewers I found quite difficult. I made a cut as instructed before cooking the meat, but the cheese fell through, so I tooth-picked it back up and grilled the roll of meat whole. I then sliced it after it was cooked. I also used Cavenders seasoning containing salt in addition to the Cavenders with no salt to equal the 2 T instructed in the recipe so that it wouldn’t be too salty. It came out perfect. The end result was quite tasty with lots of flavor! Thank you diner 524 for sharing. Made it for CQ3 – Greece, 2016"
386585,517578,2014/8/4,4,"These were a nice alternative to the stuffed cabbage rolls with tomato sauce that I am used to.  The prep time is quite a bit more than 10 minutes, though!  It takes a while to remove the stems from the leaves, etc.  I also didn&#039;t know at what temperature to cook these at, so I just went with 350 degrees.  After 1-1/2 hours, most of the sauce had evaporated.  However, they were very tasty, although I found them just a tad salty (probably should have used low-sodium broth).  But, like I said, a nice alternative.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
386585,501009,2013/10/21,5,"This was a really nice salad, despite my errors in constructing it.  I had some lovely late summer crisp lettuce, which really added a super fresh taste.  However, I added the ingredients in the order in which they were listed, and then saw that the vegetables go on first, then the met, then the cheese, dressing, and finally sunflower seeds.  Well, mine still tasted great anyway!  The only thing I was missing was the cucumber.  This makes a fabulous meal and is really very filling.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for My 3 Chefs - October 2013."

136997,493557,2013/9/2,5,"Good little sandwich. I don&#039;t care for dried parsley, so used some fresh. I also had to use up some back bacon, so subbed that for the ham. Made for Everyday Holiday Tag Game. :)"
39835,493557,2014/2/13,5,Very good sandwich. I cooked the chicken in the oven and didn&#039;t turn it. Used the swiss cheese option for the cheese. Great sandwich for sandwich night accompanied by chips and fruit. Thanks for sharing!
2001922964,519507,2018/1/10,5,Amazing!! Just like our favorite brought ones thanks for the easy to follow recipe!
582561,504329,2013/11/8,5,"Quick, easy and tasty.  When you can whip up a hand-make soup this easily and with such inexpensive and simple ingredients, it is a no-brainer.  Beats noodles or McDonalds hands down any day.  And has the added bonus of being good for you!!  Made for Aussie/Kiwi Swap November 2013."
222478,504329,2013/12/29,0,Delicious! Very refreshing and wonderfully spiced.
128473,498878,2014/10/1,5,"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe gailanng, it was really quick and easy to make with terrific results .  We really enjoyed the flavors from the breadcrumbs and  freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, it really adds a nice element to the dish.  The asparagus were perfectly cooked.  Made for Whats on the Menu tag game."
266635,498878,2014/10/21,5,"Roasting asparagus is my favorite way to prepare this delicious veggie and the bread crumb/parmesan topping was a wonderful addition.  DH really enjoyed this dish too and I will definitely be making it again.  Made for What&#039;s on the Menu tag, October, 2014. : )"
2000050844,498878,2015/3/8,5,Layering the asparagus spears as suggested and keeping a close eye on the time yielded perfectly bright green but cooked spears. I was able to then leave at room temp with a very loosely fitted steamer lid and finish the crumb topping under broiler 2 hours later. Woohoo- freed me up to socialize with my dinner guests and still created a positive impression when they saw the veggies.
2001321101,517442,2016/12/25,1,This should not even be called a recipe. I followed it to a 'T' and it's just mush. After cooking on the griddle for 30 minutes it's hot mush (yet still uncooked) with no shape and is nothing like a pancake. This was a waste of time and money.
266635,509909,2013/12/14,4,"This is a delicious appetizer and it makes a really nice presentation. We really enjoyed the addition of the avoocado slice and I think the red onion really adds great flavor as well.  To bump up the overall flavor a bit, I added some additional garlic and a touch of cumin along with additional S &amp; P.  Made for PRMR, December, 2013."
1042494,509909,2015/11/29,5,This was a nice appetizer for a family brunch.  The consistency of the bean paste was perfect.  The only change I made was that I toasted the bread slightly before adding the bean paste and then topped with bean paste and avocados and finished the toasting under the broiler.  I will definitely make this again.
2001763130,520739,2017/10/23,0,Has anyone roasted the chickpeas first?
383346,494163,2013/3/26,5,"I was so sure I had some harissa, but I didn&#039;t.  So I used Sambal Oelek.  And I used button mushrooms.  They tasted great.  I will have to do this recipe again later to do on the bbq.  It&#039;s so good.  The mushrooms were spicy just enough.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for PAC Spring 2013"
169430,511932,2014/12/28,5,"This soup really hit the spot on this cold and snowy night. We omitted the sherry and used a brown and wild rice blend. and I added some sliced almonds to my bowl. Very quixk and easy, It made a very tasty and warming dinner with hot biscuits. Made for: For Your Consideration."
227978,511932,2015/8/15,5,"This was fabulous, Linky!  I had a pork chop to use up, so I tossed that in too, but other than that, I didn&#039;t make any changes.  It was delicious.  My husband oohed and aaahed and even had a second helping, which both are not common for him.  We enjoyed it with fresh home-baked French Bread.  It was a lovely meal.  Made for Culinary Quest 2015 (Canada/ Quebec)."
2001726305,533432,2017/9/23,4,"I used some of the ingredients here. But from my MN background, I knew I had to also add some pork neck bones, oxtails, and some turkey. I also added beef broth to the chicken stock and diced tomato broth. The only thing is, real booya has to be cooked from fresh ingredients and it takes DAYS to make it properly! It also has to be shared with many. When we used to make it back in the seventies, we made it in metal kettles and people would come with ice cream buckets and buy it by the gallon to freeze some for the winter...those were the days!!! BTW, you have to have fresh rutabagas for this too...I couldn't find these in the stores here in CA (we used to pull these from our garden to cook with in MN)."
2002045972,533432,2018/3/12,3,It isn’t booya without the spice pack that turns it from vegetable soup into booya. Sorry
2788347,497784,2013/4/16,5,I liked this recipe. I used coconut milk because that was all I had on hand. I will make it again. The kids loved it.
2804848,497784,2013/4/28,5,This turned out great. It wasn&#039;t dry and rubbery as I thought it might be. Moist and perfectly yummy cornbread.
2137518,497784,2013/6/10,1,"I&#039;m giving this one star because it tasted OK. But something is missing in the recipe to hold the corn bread together - maybe xanthan gum or something. It was so crumbly, I could pretty much crumble it up and use it again in another recipe. I served it with soup, but tossed all the rest into the trash. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone."
1800050750,497784,2013/9/15,5,"This is very yummy, my brother makes it whenever we have cornbread!"
2001537262,497784,2017/5/14,5,"Not as sweet as 'regular' cornbread but it's not like I can't modify that the next time if I want it to be. It's great. I might have baked it s little to long as it was a big dry, but that was my mistake."
2001645572,497784,2017/7/27,4,"Needing to make it also Paleo friendly and reading reviews, I made my own modifications. Will not use soymilk, so used unsweetened almond milk. Used white masa harina instead of regular cornmeal. Used 1 cup brown rice flour instead of 3/4c. Use real butter only. Instead of processed sugar, used 1/4 c raw honey and 3 teaspoons coconut sugar. Used 2 eggs and Himalayan salt. Moist, taste good and not overly crumbly."
47892,501126,2013/6/5,4,"I switched things around with this recipe. First I gently simmered fresh pureed tomatoes with salt and pepper. While the sauce was simmering, the onions were browned in a combination of butter and olive oil. Then fresh green beans were placed on top of the browned onions, a splash of water, covered and steamed for five minutes. Plated the green beans and onions, stirred in the sour cream, yogurt and vinegar with the tomato and spooned that on top of the vegetables. Garnished with fresh basil and seasoned with salt and pepper. The only complaint and a minor one is for me the eye appeal. I think some folks might be put off by the pink color of the tomato sauce after stirring in the sour cream and yogurt. The flavor is delicious however! Made for Veg Tag/June. PS the directions are missing when to stir in the white vinegar."
1620171,501126,2013/11/14,5,This was really amazing! We added some enochi mushrooms and some baby homegrown potatoes to turn this from a side to a main. The sauce was completely stunning. I&#039;m seriously planning basing a new dish around that sauce. Thanks for a beautiful &#039;trip&#039; to Azerbaijan. Made for My Food Odyssey.
2002071085,531333,2018/3/26,0,I haven't tried this recipe yet but wanted to say that the filling recipe directions don't seem complete. The directions seem to have left out the part for the mascarpone filling. It does sound good.
2002091569,531333,2018/4/2,5,"This recipe and video were great! I made it with an all purpose gluten free flour (allergies) and also substituted maple syrup for the honey because we are gigantic maple syrup fans in our house. It worked out great for an Easter Brunch dessert! Light and delicious and very beautiful. I did cook for less than 40 minutes as it just seemed too long. The strawberries were starting to shrivel. It seemed fine. The recipe didn't recommend adding a dollop of mascarpone &amp; drizzling with honey. I rewatched the video and saw it. When I eat leftovers tomorrow, I will definitely try it. Yum. I will make it again."
2002052229,531333,2018/4/3,5,Here's my version. I just cut the strawberries in half and placed them inside down. Also switched out the honey for raw agave nectar. Served it as dessert for Easter dinner. It was a hit. The filling was especially good.
2002103432,531333,2018/4/8,0,Sooo Anxious to try this and possibly try different fruits as well.
1663024,502101,2013/10/14,5,"Being born and raised in the southern state of Florida, I adore cornbread and fresh oranges but never considered combining the two. This was my first time baking cornbread from scratch without a boxed mix, and I vow never to use a mix again. These corn muffins are a million times better than my usual ones made with Arrowhead Mills Organic Cornbread and Muffin Mix! I made twelve corn muffins replacing all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. Also, I reduced the amount of oil to 3 tablespoons and increased the milk to 1 cup to compensate for less oil. Using a No. 16 spring-handled ice-cream scoop filled the muffin cups to the perfect level in one try (different scoop sizes are identified by number). Doubling the Honey-Orange Glaze as recommended for muffins made exactly &frac14; cup of the glaze, which is one teaspoon per muffin for twelve muffins. I used a measuring teaspoon to evenly pour the glaze on each muffin instead of basting with a brush because I did not want to waste one precious drop of the delectable glaze. The muffins were incredibly moist and delicious. Oranges are not just for breakfast...I served Honey-Orange Glazed Corn Bread Muffins with savory oxtail soup and the freshness of sweet honey and citrus really jazzed up a humble bowl of beef and vegetables. Thank you, Spice Guru, for elevating cornbread, a simple comfort food, to another dimension!"
498271,508578,2013/11/4,5,"You can&#039;t beat a good pepperoni pizza and this one was great!  I made a thin crust version using recipe #70165.  Here in southeast TX I can&#039;t get Provel cheese (seems to be a St Louis thing) but I did some research and found that it&#039;s a processed blend of cheddar, swiss and provolone.  Trying to get a similar taste/texture for my pizza I blended some Laughing Cow processed swiss cheese, shredded mild cheddar, and sliced provolone in my food processor and used that to top the pizza.  I can&#039;t say how that compares to real Provel but it was really great on this pizza, giving a rich and creamy balance to the spicy pepperoni.  Great pizza - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
724631,508578,2013/11/30,5,"Intense flavor sensation, WOW!  I also cannot buy Provel rope cheese locally, but saw Recipe#382006 and then elsewhere on the web people did without the Liquid Smoke by using smoked provolone.  I took the &quot;gourmet&quot; tack shredding Cabot 3-year (white) cheddar, Applewood-smoked swiss, and imported smoked provolone in a 2:1:1 ratio.  I used a personal pizza-sized pizza crust and did without the 4 minute baking as the crust had been prebrowned.  Following the lead of my favorite local Italian restaurant, I glazed olive oil on the crust before spreading the pizza sauce.  Can&#039;t wait to make this again, but sliding some sliced mushrooms under the cheese as well.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."
128473,513150,2014/3/27,5,"I love buttermilk waffles Dienia and these babies do not disappoint.  They were crisp and tender, just the way I like them.  Quick and really easy to make.  They were on the table before I knew it.

1802277632,507769,2014/1/12,5,"Really easy to make, I added makuna honey and ground cinnamon to mine and it&#039;s just as good as shop brought oat milk. Perfect for breakfast smoothies :)"
2000101589,507769,2015/4/11,5,Easy to make. Just need to figure out how to sweeten the milk a little bit to get the kids approval.
2000321739,507769,2015/7/7,5,Hahaha amazing! Even my mom  likes it. Goodbye cows milk!
2000693376,507769,2015/11/19,4,"I tried making this twice because the first time I didn&#039;t realize I was out of sea salt so I had to resort to the table salt I leave out for guests I don&#039;t like. You wouldn&#039;t believe it but that pinch of salt being sea salt (especially from the Himalayas) vs the inorganic, unnatural, and probably-mostly-made-out-of-poison table salt really makes a world of difference. The first batch was mud brown and gelatinous, but the second batch that I made with Himalayan sea salt was nothing short of ambrosia sent down from the heavens. Thank GOD you recommended that salt above any other.

A question, though. The oats you used, were they organic gluten-free oats? I hear that they add gluten into oats sometimes. If you could answer by sending positive thoughts into a quartz stone to boost your voice in the collective unconsciousness that would be divine.

Namaste."
2001035140,507769,2016/6/2,5,"Very easy, quick, cheap and delicious!! I added one teaspoon of honey and some vanilla!"
865936,503637,2013/7/26,5,These were very good.  I like that there is almost as much vegetables and sausage as there are beans.  Makes it very tasty without needing additional salt.

895132,514259,2014/8/23,5,"Great and easy pizza recipe!! I prepared a gluten free pizza dough for only 1 pizza (12 inches diameter) using 100 g brown rice flour, 75 g millet flour, 125 g cornstarch,1 1/2 tsp. xanthan gum, 1 1/2 tsp. instant dry yeast, 175 ml luke warm water, 1 tbsp. oilve oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon honey. Kneaded everything thoroughly, let rise 1 hour, then spread in the pan and followed the recipe instructions to the letter, and it worked fabulously!! The only change I made was to chop the tomatoes because my grater is not sharp enough to grate a tomato LOL. The fresh tomato instead of sugo was a wonderful idea, we absolutely loved it. I&#039;ll make this again for sure, thanks for sharing!"

I made this as written except I omitted the green peppers, due to DH&#039;s dislike and added sliced celery, and seasoned with several shakes of cayenne pepper but less then called for in the recipe, big whimp lol.  I also used smoke sausage, as was stated in the intro, but then noticed in the ingredients it said andouille sausage, but I stuck with the smoke sausage as I already had a skinless unopened package.   This has a fantastic flavor from all the seasonings and veggies.  Served ours over rice and sprinkled it with some sliced green onions.  I made this over two days, so it does take some time with soaking the beans etc. but so worth the time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."

1683962,504848,2013/8/19,2,"This is an interesting dish. I would have not thought to use sweet potato in a Persian salad, but it works. It is healthy as far as ingredients, which is why I gave it a go, but the proportions seemed a little unbalanced to me. I will likely cut up some more cherry tomatoes to even out the ratio between cucumbers. With 4-5 Persian cucumbers and only 5-6 cherry tomatoes, you end up having a lot more green than red, although the sweet potato balanced out the colors, if not the flavors. I cut the cherry tomatoes in half to distribute more fully, but I think it could use 2-3 times the amount prescribed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I cooked a sweet potato at 350 for 45 minutes (and pricked with a fork) but I think it needed more time to be the right texture for potato salad. (Good idea to use for leftover sweet potato.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would modify this recipe by chopping up everything a lot smaller and adding some parsley and maybe some salt."

131126,505158,2013/10/25,5,I paired with fried potatoes and Recipe #504832 for a pub style fish and chips meal. The fish batter was lighter in texture than other recipes I&#039;ve tried and one could taste the fish.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!
2001077257,505158,2016/7/5,3,Recipe needs a dredging process or else the batter slips right off in the oil. My fish looked nothing like the photo. Too much garlic powder as well. Keep working at it and it will turn out well.
2001631106,505158,2017/7/21,1,"You MUST dredge fish in flour prior to frying otherwise the batter won't adhere. Also, NEVER leave any deep fried food sit on paper towels. Makes food soggy. This is food science 101."

482376,505566,2013/8/24,5,"Excellent!! Really very easy, too. I adored the flavor of lemongrass and kaffir leaves with the Thai red curry paste and coconut milk.

486725,504439,2015/4/11,5,"I used this as a dipping sauce, and it was really good. But I think your ideas of using it on meat (or Asian noodles) are good ones. I also like how you mention adjusting the amounts to your taste - I did just that, using less fish sauce and more lime. In addition, I used sweet chili sauce for the chillies and sugar, since I was making this on the fly and did not have the chillies in house. I used half the garlic, and it was still really garlicky, but in a good way, it gives it a nice bite that blends well with the spiciness. You&#039;re right, an all around winner and very versatile."

2001415188,503292,2017/8/22,0,"Sounds good, I'm sure it is though I haven't tried your recipe. I found a recipe in the THREE GUYS COOK CUBAN cook book. They are two Cuban guys and their Swedish (?) brother in law. You may have heard of the book. Use a regular auto drip coffee maker. Water: use 5, yes five, measures of coffee for each 6 or 8 oz cup you want. Measure the coffee into your cone or other filter/holder. Coffee carafe: for each cup of coffee measure a table spoon of sugar into the carafe. The hot coffee will melt it. Pour the measured water into your coffee maker's resevoir and turn the coffee maker on brew. When the coffee is finished pour yourself a cup. I always use a 2 oz espresso cup to drink from. Add anything you want to it but, first try it 'as is'. I like it black. All the best to you and your readers. T. Cole"

I forgot how fabulous good banana bread can be, and I?m a convert to coconut flour, which is perfect in this recipe. I took the advice below and added a tsp of cider vinegar, and I used 3 eggs, and (less) maple syrup instead of honey, so I was guessing a little about the substitutions, but it seems a very forgiving recipe, the hallmark of a household favourite. I mixed the whole thing in the food processor since my bananas weren?t as ripe as they should be for baking, and added of 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips instead of the pecans. I baked it in 4 mini loafs (silicon) and it was done in 50 minutes, super moist, and very tasty. I?m already planning next time to make it with walnuts or pecans."
1803700092,502049,2015/1/24,4,I used a non stick loaf and the bottom was a little darker than I would like.   I cooked mine for 55 minutes and it is very moist     I used macadamia nuts and very little honey (1 tbsp)     It is delicious but next time I&#039;ll try no nuts so my kids will eat it!  ....or not.   I&#039;m going to have it for a quick breakfast in the mornings next week.   I might also try it out for the bread in my breakfast sandwich maker.  I like this recipe a lot
2000309638,502049,2015/7/2,0,Surprisingly delicious!
2000547754,502049,2015/10/11,1,"Not sure why but this was awful for me.  Followed the recipe exactly and it ended up exceedingly moist, resembling quiche or frittata and also tasting very much like eggs.  I have just stuck it back in oven to try and dry it out."
1814507,502049,2015/11/1,5,"Awesome recipe, thank you!  I followed bonniedgros&#039;s advice and added 1 tsp ACV.  It&#039;s light, fluffly and moist, not things I usually hear to describe gluten-free banana bread.  Additionally, I omitted the nuts and honey and it was still sweet enough for me (being careful with sugars)  Being a little less sweet and mild tasting, it will work nice for spreads or as one reader suggested, french toast!

Will definitely make again!  Thank you :)"
2000819995,502049,2016/1/15,5,"So freaking good, made in bunt pan and was very pretty. Used walnuts instead of pecans and replaced the honey with palm sugar. You cannot tell its coconut flour at all. Everything else I&#039;ve made with coconut flour seemed grainy. This puffed up and was so moist."
2001277101,502049,2016/12/1,0,About to go in the oven. I was shocked at the bananas and eggs needed for a small pan of bread! Only one tweak of adding apple cider vinegar made and probably too much salt ?? Very curious to see how it comes out the batter was so thick This is my first attempt at cooking with coconut flour!
2001331248,502049,2017/1/1,5,"Would like to know how many calories this has in it?? Didn't use apple cider either.. taste great ???? I'm on a diet counting calories, thanks for an answer ??"
2001348093,502049,2017/1/12,0,Baked this tonight and it came out looking burnt on the outside and the inside is dark as well. I did try it and it tastes yummy so I'm not sure what happened with the color. Anyone know why this might have happened? I did use coconut sugar instead of honey so not sure if that would have contributed to the burnt look.
1803683793,508938,2015/1/20,5,"I really love this recipe! I substituted the chia gel for a flax and chia blend, but it worked just as well. The recipe was easy to follow and the Bread was delicious and nutritious! Thank you Kristiano129!!"
65502,502804,2013/8/16,4,"I had some problems with this recipe. I was wondering how this could set with the ratio of broth to eggs - mine only half set. After 15 minutes I checked it and it looked like the top was set but there was a lot of liquid under it. I cooked it another 15 and it looked the same so I ate it kind of like soup. I only used the outside of the tomato so I didn&#039;t get any extra liquid from that. Also the garlic listed in the ingredients isn&#039;t mentioned in the recipe so I put it in the egg mixture.Why 4 stars? Honestly, the flavour of this was very good! It was kind of greyish but that may be due to the fact that I cooked it for a long time (no photo!). It would be interesting to try this again with half the broth because the texture and taste were really good. Made for the Tasty Testers for ZWT9. Thanks Random Rachel! :)"
498271,502804,2013/8/23,4,"This is a different and tasty way to serve eggs!  Mine did set up but like another reviewer I had about a tablespoon of broth at the bottom of the dish that the cooked egg was floating in - almost like a poached scrambled egg.  It had good flavor and I think chopped bell pepper or mushrooms would work in this as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
2000171562,508938,2015/4/28,0,"I have made with 1/2cup of chia seeds instead, as i don ve flaxseeds around. The bread turn out to be quite moist at the bottom? baked at 190c for 40mins. Pls do shed some light here? Thanks"
400708,508938,2015/6/28,5,"This is a really poor photo, but my family attacked this bread before I could even get a photo so it was all I had.  But maybe not a great photo but certainly a great bread.  Perfect for toast, sandwiches or just eating plain.  This is a real keeper and I&#039;ll be making again and again.  Thanks so much for posting this.  Turned out soft and full of flavor and was gone in one day."
2000498281,508938,2017/2/4,5,"This is a really good recipe. I've made it twice in two days. The first time I made it as is, the second time I couldn't resist tweaking it, of course! I substituted half the milk for water, and reduced the honey to 2 Tbsp, which was still plenty sweet. Instead of flax seed meal, I used 1/2 cup of crushed pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds, and then I substituted spelt flour for the wheat flour. Both are yummy. Thank you for the original recipe."
169430,493125,2013/1/27,5,"I made one serving and enjoyed it tremendously for breakfast this morning. Simple and fresh, kind of like having sunshine on your plate. I had Meyer lemon tea with it great pairing. I did skip the honey water for diabetic reasons  and there was already more than enough sugar in the fruit. I really loved the nuts too. Thanks for posting :D"
174096,493125,2013/3/10,5,"This is a real delight!  Flavorful, colorful, and delicious.  The crunch from the nuts was a nice complement to the fruit.  Thanks for sharing!  Veggie Swap 56"
47892,493125,2013/6/12,5,Refreshingly light and delicious! I skipped the pom seeds and added instead a drizzle of pom syrup. Local clover honey. Made for Veg Tag/June.
163112,493125,2013/12/7,5,"oh my goodness I made this so long ago but forgot to review it.  :(  this is fabulous even if I did essentially reconstruct it.  Turns out I was out of a few things so I did some successful subbing.  I had planned on using pomegranate molasses instead of pom seeds but shockingly, I was OUT.  So, I used date syrup &amp; left out the honey.  Otherwise I did as I was told &amp; we all enjoyed it very much, thank you.  Made for NA/ME Tag 11/13."
773645,493125,2016/7/24,5,This is fabulous! Made it for a book club with a Moroccan theme and could not stop eating the leftovers the rest of the week. Bringing it to a summer potluck this weekend.
128473,511827,2014/3/21,5,This was a lovely coffee Ceezie.  I enjoyed it very much.  I didn&#039;t have any creme di menthe so I rimmed the glass with green sugar and sprinkled some of the green sugar over top of the whipped cream.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for Please Review My Recipe.
67728,505108,2013/9/9,5,"Yum! This makes a pretty big cake -- I was nervously watching it while it was baking, because I was afraid that it would overflow the pan, but no. It rose beautifully and had a lovely crunchy top (well, bottom, once it was depanned). The crunchy part softened up the next day, but the cake was still moist, chocolatey and delicious. The rum and coffee were pretty subtle in this --neither were really stand-out flavors to me, they just made the chocolate flavor more complex. Now normally I wouldn&#039;t go for straight-up chocolate cake that doesn&#039;t have some type of frosting, but this was perfect with nothing more than a dusting of powdered sugar. It would probably be awesome warmed up a bit and with a scoop of ice cream, too, but we&#039;ve been too busy eating it as-is. Thanks for posting!"
2000206526,516049,2015/5/16,0,Absolutely horrible the quantities are all wrong. The filling was far to watery and the texture after baking was like scrambled eggs. Do not try this.
2000219673,516049,2015/5/29,4,I used this recipe for my first ever attempt at making a cheese cake.  I chose the German Cheese Cake since I was born in Germany and love their cheese cakes.  It turned out terrific.  I noticed one comment that said it was runny.  Mine was not so all I can say is that the writer made an error somewhere.
135470,504494,2013/8/24,4,"This was a good flavorful drink, my DH like it more than I did but we both enjoyed it (my instinct is too add seltzer as I go for less intense drinks usually) . I was concerned about the fish sauce but it just enhanced the other flavors. I didn&#039;t care for the cinnamon on the rim so would just sprinkle a tiny bit on top instead. Made for ZWT 9 SE Asia by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers."
386585,514346,2014/4/1,5,"This was super tasty, and pretty easy too (despite the long list of ingredients).  The flavor is sort of a sweet and sour taste (between the sugars and the acids).  The hot sauce really adds a lot of pop.  I actually ended up adding about 1 T!  Although this is a cooked bean salad, we chilled it and had it for lunch.  It was perfect!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Holiday Tag Game."
2801253,498837,2013/4/25,4,"This is a very tasty recipe. My family just wanted to keep eating it even after we were all full!  It did take longer than half an hour for the meat to be tender--more like an hour.  I would love to try it in a slow cooker.  Also, the recipe makes a little too much sauce for the amount of meat and onions in it. So, I have made these alterations:  8 - 10 pieces of bacon,1 1/2 - 2 lbs of round steak, a large onion,  2 cloves of garlic, 2 10 oz cans of soup (I prefer golden mushroom to cream of shroom), light sour cream to taste.  Be sure to cook the onion and meat in the bacon drippings.  The bacon and paprika give this such a unique and delicious flavor!  This will be the beef stroganoff recipe I use from now on!  Leeka, tell dad he did well!"
2865217,498837,2013/6/17,4,"Great tasting and easy recipe. I love the idea of using cream of mushroom soup. I omitted the bacon only because I was out of it, but next time I&#039;ll try it with the bacon. The paprika also gave off a great flavor. I&#039;ll definitely be making this again."
97745,516897,2014/10/20,5,"This marinade was a hit in my household!  I wanted a marinade for pork chops that wasn&#039;t overwhelming with soy sauce. I used 7-up for the lemon-lime beverage and did substitute red pepper as I didn&#039;t have cayenne. I used four center cut chops and marinated them in a gallon zip lock for 6 hrs, turning once. They came off the grill moist with a nice little zippy flavor. Can&#039;t wait to try it with chicken breasts. I will definitely be using this recipe again. YUM!!"
169430,503238,2013/7/19,5,"Oh yummy!  I actually lowered the servings to 1 and then to 1/2 cup of the rice and all else accordingly. It was still a big brekkie for me but oh so good. I used leftover rice, some baked ham that was in the freezer. This is substantial enough to keep you going for a long while and in my opinion it&#039;s quite suitable for any meal of the day. The seasoning was spot on for me in this dish. In short, I loved it. Thanks Deb :D"
133174,503238,2013/9/6,5,Very yummy.  I did reduce the rice to 1 cup and it was more than enough for 2 people.  DH and I enjoyed this very much for supper.  Made for ZWT9 Family Picks.
126440,503238,2013/9/7,5,Great breakfast for the two of us.  Loved the spice and used up some veggies and rice in the frig.
400708,503238,2014/9/30,5,"Saved this a while ago and was waiting until I had some left over rices as DH loves cajun food.  Well we were not disappointed and he&#039;s already asking me to make it again.  I did make changes due to what i had on hand, but don&#039;t think it made any difference in the great taste.  Used white rice and a red bell pepper and sausage instead of ham.  For the creole spice used recipe#22089 then followed the amounts as directed.  Just right for us with.  Will be using this one again and again."
386585,505018,2013/11/4,0,"I can&#039;t give a proper rating because, I&#039;m not sure what I did wrong, but my gnocchi came our terribly.  I have made gnocchi before, and grew up watching my grandmother and mother make them, although they always used warm potatoes.  The gnocchi came out very gummy, and I could not use them.  However, I was able to salvage the sauce and served it over some rotelle pasta that I quickly cooked up.  The sauce was really delicious and would be great with any pasta.  I used fontina cheese (I&#039;m not sure what fontilla is, but I couldn&#039;t find it).  The sauce is very hearty, and I would definitely make it again.  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
2784242,496638,2013/4/14,5,"Great recipe!  The Plan is a very good book if you&#039;re looking to figure out what foods trigger weight gain and inflammation.  I have doubled this recipe and I use cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves.  I&#039;ve always forgotten the vanilla for some reason.  The last ten minutes I add cut up walnuts, almonds, Brazil nuts and coconut flakes (thick shaves).  If I add raisins or dried cranberries I do so when it comes out of the oven so they don&#039;t break my teeth.  This one is a keeper.  I eat it 1/2 cup with 1/2 cup of rice flakes, rice milk and frozen blueberries.  Great breakfast.  Thanks!"
2324285,509751,2013/12/26,5,"I served this rice as a side dish for a holiday meal, and it was very much enjoyed.  I love how much flavor is in there, without the use of very many spices.  The saffron really brings everything together, and getting artichoke pieces with each bite was a treat."
2000691749,512071,2016/11/12,5,"It was exactly what I have been looking for! Skip the other recipes,this is the one. I love the sweet taste of the asiago."

724631,513178,2014/2/20,5,"Tasty Chicago-style pizza with St. Louis Provel cheese.  When I made nochlo&#039;s excellent Recipe#508578 #508578, I simulated Provel cheese with Recipe#382006 #382006, and it had a decidedly cheddar taste.  This time I elected to combine Sargento&#039;s Chef Blends 4 Cheese Pizzeria (Shredded Natural Mozzarella, Cheddar, Smoked Provolone and Non-Smoked Sharp Provolone) with Sargento&#039;s Artisan Blends Swiss (Shredded Natural Swiss &amp; Grand Cru Cheese), with muted cheddar cheese taste, but complex enough to tantalize.  This pizza is heavy with pepperoni and sausage but a relatively light cheese topping.  This was a delicious change of pace for us.  The only flat bread I could find at my local market was a cracker, and I made an okay pizza with that as long as I did not try to toast the cracker first; I think nochlo meant something more like naan or pita bread, which would work pretty much like pizza crust.  As a backup, I made a pizza on a Boboli crust, toasting it a few minutes as nochlo instructed, and that pizza was excellent!  In short, you&#039;ll love this pizza if you love pepperoni and Italian sausage and don&#039;t use a cracker as a base. As for the cheese, if your family prefers cheddar to mozzarella, go with Recipe#382006 #382006; if you want muted cheddar, you might try the blend I described.  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
212609,513178,2014/3/5,5,"A quick and easy pizza solution....the flatbreads came out beautifully, and provided us with a good crispy base that held the toppings well.&lt;br/&gt;I used a blend of Colby, Mozzarella, Parmesan and Romano for the cheeses, and it all worked out to be a very tasty combination.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks nochlo...another winner from your collection.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR"
2002236048,532997,2018/8/1,0,This was great - I replaced the sage with coriander and used tasty cheddar instead of parmesan. Delicious soft and creamy cauliflower and oh so very tasty
37107,496902,2016/8/22,3,"Well that was disappointing. I thought I found the perfect cauliflower crust without having to wring it out through a tea towel. The only thing I did different was I used the whole large cauliflower so I doubled the whole recipe. It was so moist, it didn't crisp up and we couldn't pick it up. I didn't make it that thick either because I don't like thick pizza crust. Now that's not the end of the world, but I really do enjoy picking up slices of pizza. I only used 1/2 the recipe for the pizza, I used a large pizza stone, and I froze the rest. I'm thinking once it's thawed out, I will squeeze the liquid out of it and see how that works. The flavour was pretty good though. I really want to find the perfect cauliflower pizza crust."
1680722,503155,2013/7/22,5,"This is a super easy and delicious cake. I can really recommend it and I will do it again.&lt;br/&gt;I prepared this during my vacations in Greece, with delicios oranges (the zest of them is really super tasty).&lt;br/&gt;I used a package (1 pound) of a phyllo quality for sweets. &lt;br/&gt;I will make this for my children as well as I know they will enjoy it very much.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks  a lot for posting this wonderful recipe."
1925885,503155,2013/7/27,4,"This was good - a bit different, but good!  I will definitely make this again, and will reduce the olive oil and try to find a lighter tasting olive oil, as the flavor was pretty pronounced.  And I can&#039;t blame the recipe, but with the humidity here the phyllo didn&#039;t dry up the way I would have liked, so the texture was probably affected. The orange syrup was wonderful, though - so don&#039;t skimp on the sauce!  This bakes up beautifully, and is really easy to make.  If you&#039;re thinking about this too hard - don&#039;t!  Go ahead and make it - you&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised!  Thanks for posting, BK!  Made for the Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."

I am not a big fan of polenta, but I have to admit this was a treat. It was an overall sensory experience. It was almost as pleasing to the eye as it was to the palate, and the smell was wonderful. 
It&#039;s a great recipe to prepare and share with loved ones."
2001914965,519116,2018/1/6,4,"This is a delicious recipe. I made it, adding red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper to make it hot. Based on experience with other recipes, I used 1 Tbsp per pound; I like it slightly stronger and I think this amount better resembles the taste of commercial products. However, this did not taste like Odem's Tennessee Pride. Again, it's delicious, but missing something. Maybe more nutmeg?"
2002152253,509289,2018/5/14,5,Nice &amp; delicious recipe
373020,512110,2014/3/16,5,"This was delicious!  The spices are spot on and amazing, I can&#039;t believe this hasn&#039;t been rated before.  I altered the vegetables to use up what I had on hand (grocery shopping day is tomorrow) but tried to keep the volume the same, also, I used a bit less the lentils (yep, gotta buy more of those too) but finished off what was in my canister.  I cooked all my vegetables at once (to save time) and from start to finish my soup took less than 50 minutes.  I didn&#039;t have any tomatoes, so I added an extra 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for posting. P.s. I think the addition of meat would be good too and left over rice, what a great recipe to use up what is in the bottom of the fridge!"

593927,492958,2013/1/7,4,"Ok. I changed this some but had mushrooms and baby spinach on hand and a game to play it in. I made ours dairy free by substituting light extra virgin olive oil for the butter and omitting the cheese. The cheese would have been good but it was fine vegan-wise without it. We have an aversion to dried thyme so I replaced it with dried marjoram, a common substitution of mine. I used sea salt, to taste, no pepper but a bit of recipe#257499 and served the dishes separate but together - no oven time. Not sure this is authentically Omani but I made it for DD1 (5 years old) DD2 (14 months) and I & for January 2013 ~ NA/ME Explores OMAN!"

2712608,495972,2013/2/26,5,This was so good that my grandchildren loved it!!  It was very cheesy and I made it so quickly that there was no problem with waiting for this meal!!
2717887,495972,2013/3/2,5,This is a great recipe for working moms! It is very simple and quick to make; perfect for those busy days and last minute meals.  The kids loved the flavor and I knew they were getting a wholesome meal.  Thank you!!
1678694,529736,2017/2/14,5,"Let it set first.. then it's great! Unique and intense flavor, gorgeous presentation... loved it! My friends and I ate this warm, maybe 20 minutes out of the oven. Interestingly, at that point, I would have given it probably 2 stars.. couldn't get my taste buds around the lemon &amp; chocolate mingling together, and the bottom crust was too wet. Luckily for me, we had leftovers... turns out this is MUCH better the longer it's set. Great after 4-6 hours (chocolate and bottom crust finally settled), and FANTASTIC chilled the next day (the harder chocolate enhanced the texture of a perfect crust with luscious strawberries). Now that's actually saying a lot, coming from someone who prefers virtually everything eaten warm right out of the oven. Also, the longer it set, the less the lemon intruded. By the second day, the lemon had fully faded and I didn't notice it at all. I made the pie dough from scratch (a fully butter recipe) and used the exact size pan as called for, 10.5&quot; x 15.5.&quot; I ended up needing 2-1/2 crusts total (1-1/2 for the bottom and 1 for the top). I was a little reluctant to brush the top with milk/cream, but it turned out well. I brushed all over with probably 1-2 Tbsp of heavy cream, and it had the effect of lightening and softening the crust (I almost want to say aerating it), so that it's a little closer to a phyllo-type crust. The cream-brushing also allowed me to bake the full 40 minutes without burning the crust: the strawberries and both crusts were all perfect. After having set, the bottom crust was golden brown and fully cooked.. not too wet after all. Next time, I'll try a (homemade) shortening crust instead, so that the heart cutouts will keep their highly-defined shape (butter crusts are super-yummy, but tend to melt a little more, losing their shape). As I was putting in the strawberries, I wondered whether to include the sugary red juice from the strawberry bowl or not. I decided to add it, and (after having set of course) I think it's perfect. Lastly, set your heart cutouts on a baking sheet, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon and bake 10 minutes at 425 degrees.. a cute little cookie to serve with each slab of pie."
305531,505540,2013/8/20,5,"Yum. Even though I messed this up terribly, it turned out really well. I made this with legs only because when my package labeled &#039;2 thighs&#039; defrosted, it turned out to be a large breast instead. I had everything prepped ahead of time, but plans changed suddenly at dinner time, so these marinated overnight. I would not recommend this because the marinade solidified a bit and was hard to totally cover the legs evenly. Then I forgot to coat the legs in the peanut/panko mixture that was already mixed up. lol. Even though I totally messed up, these turned out really well. Can&#039;t wait to make it again - the right way! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Susie. Made for ZWT9."
219942,505540,2013/8/23,5,"Delicious. I, too, had a malfunction of plans when I made this. It got left in the marinade for a full 24 hours!  I was making it for my daughter, and she only likes chicken breasts, so I used 2 large ones and pounded them slightly so they were of uniform thickness. Then plans changed, so they got left in the fridge until the next night. Then coated them and baked them on a rack at 400&deg; for 20 minutes. They were moist and very, very tasty! The lemon zest added a spark of brightness to the overall yumminess. I didn&#039;t put the garlic in the coating because I thought it would make it too wet, so I added it to the marinade, and put a pinch of garlic powder into the coating. When I make this again I might put a little milk into the marinade, just to make it easier to coat the chicken, but that is certainly not a deal-breaker for this recipe to be a keeper! This will go into my regular rotation. Thanks Susie!   ZWT9"
88099,505540,2013/8/25,5,Excellent flavor combination in the marinade.  I also added minced garlic to the mixture.  Loved the peanut mixture.  I used additional garlic powder instead of the minced which worked well for me.  I doubled the breading mixture and had just a little left over after breading 2 large chicken breast that I cut in half and split length-wise to make them thinner.  Thanks so much Susie for sharing.  Made for New Kids on the Block tag game.
679953,505540,2013/9/24,5,"The marinade was just superb !  The chicken had great flavor.  Made this as is but used 8 chicken legs, and I made a small slit in each of them, so the marinade can seep into the chicken, which turned out real well.  Kids really enjoyed this too.  Made for a great dinner with some potato skins.  Tagged in I Recommend."
266635,505540,2015/10/26,5,What a nice change of pace for baked chicken.  We loved the marinade and the breading for the chicken as well.  Will definitely make this delicious baked chicken again soon.
486725,505540,2016/2/15,5,"Halved the recipe and used two large chicken breasts (baking longer), and the other ingredients were spot on for amounts. We omitted the honey and added less salt. This dish is a little labor intensive, but I am glad we made it for a special Valentine&#039;s meal, it was perfect for it, and so delicious. One of the best chicken dishes we have made in a long time. Definitely going into my best of 2016!"
482376,505540,2016/2/29,5,Great chicken. The flavor combination was really good. I really liked the crunch from the crispy coating. Thank you!
227978,505540,2016/8/1,5,"This was fabulous. I really liked all the flavors in the peanut coating, and it baked so nicely and kept the chicken very moist through the baking. Everyone commented that it's something they'd like again real soon, and it's not all that often that I hear that from everyone in my family. It's definitely a &quot;keeper&quot;. Thanks, Susie D. Made for Culinary Quest 2016 (Thailand)."
732477,529468,2017/2/19,5,I did everything the same except I put in milk and not 2 eggs. And I used 8 oz of cream cheese instead of ricotta... I had these ingredients on hand! delicious ?? !!!!
107135,504245,2013/7/30,5,this was very nice.it didnt fill up mr picky though lol pretty breakfast
498271,504245,2013/8/1,5,"Wonderful breakfast treat!  I made half of the recipe and it was enough batter for one 8-layer stack - perfect.  I used pear butter for my filling and sifted a little powdered sugar on top.  Delicious - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
171790,504245,2013/8/8,5,"Delicious! The pancakes were nice and thin, just the way we like them. I spread strawberry rhubarb jam between the layers. Made for the Soup-A-Stars ZWT9."
143721,504245,2013/8/31,5,"Made these this morning.  I used homemade blueberry jam as the filling.  The adults gave great reviews.  My 2yr old GS liked the pancakes and not the blueberry jam, go figure!!  Made for ZWT9 and &quot;The Apron String Travelers&quot;"
1179225,504245,2013/12/12,5,Loved these! I halved the recipe for the two of us and cooked them in a slightly smaller skillet. Topped with raspberry jam and dusted with powdered sugar right before serving. Delicious! This is a great recipe to use when you want breakfast to seem a little more special.. Thanks for sharing this keeper recipe
2442045,531001,2017/4/5,5,Great!
43138142,501080,2015/1/13,0,"This is the greatest tomato soup/bisque on the planet- so easy and crazy delicious! We found our garlic and onions burnt a little more quickly for some reason, so we roast those on a different sheet pan for a little less time. It&#039;s the perfect comforting little warm up to pack in the kids&#039; lunch boxes.Vegans &amp; non-vegans alike adore all of Chloe Coscarelli&#039;s recipes. Her cookbooks are a necessity in our kitchen. Try out this bisque (from her 1st cookbook) and you&#039;ll rush out to buy all three!"
542159,505609,2013/8/24,5,Yum! We really enjoyed easy to make grilled chicken. I did marinade for two to three hours as life happened and while the chicken was cooking boiled down the marinade to make a glaze to serve over the chicken. Thanks for the post.
418718,497311,2013/3/22,5,Easy and wonderful recipe!!! I like it!!!
1547388,497311,2013/3/22,0,Mom adores a great hash! She&#039;s going to flip when I make your recipe using diced Simply Potatoes with onion and peppers! Such a easy and delicious recipe :)
1592049,497311,2013/3/22,5,Love Hash!! This Recipe is Delicious!! AWESOME FLAVORS :-)
2201427,497311,2013/3/23,5,LOVE this recipe!!  hash is one of my favorites!!!
2423055,497311,2013/3/24,5,"This is our kind of dish! We love corned beef hash and this recipe is easy, fast and sounds delish!! I think I&#039;ll make it tomorrow for lunch! I just happen to have all the ingredients on hand! YUM!"
2680727,497311,2013/3/24,5,Hash is a great breakfast; love it.
2414156,497311,2013/3/24,5,So hitting my Irish heart with this hash!
654393,497311,2013/3/30,0,Another great recipe for hash that I am going to have to try!
2001297534,537485,2018/11/17,5,I made this recipe as written. It was easy to put together and was quite tasty. Thanks for sharing.
476796,498285,2016/11/15,4,This isn't bad. For my tastes it needed a little something. I added worcestershire and a chipotle. Nice with macaroni or baked potatoes.
169430,503721,2013/11/8,5,"Another wonderful coffee BK :D. Oh my gosh it&#039;s good! I don&#039;t know if I would actually bother whipping the cream next time as it melted into the hot fresh coffee pretty much instantly. Not a bad thing as it flavored the coffee divinely, just kind of made the whipping an unnecessary step. I just adore your coffees my friend. Keep them coming and I&#039;ll keep making them. :D"
37449,503721,2013/12/6,5,Very nice! I actually used whipped cream in a can and brewed the cardamom and mace with the coffee. Thanks for the treat! :)
251917,503721,2014/2/25,5,Aussie Swap #85: Outstanding blend of spices in this coffee treat! The spiced whipped topping is divine!
386585,503721,2014/3/13,5,"I love cardamom, so I knew this would be right up my alley!  I actually did the same as Sharon123 and brewed the spices with the coffee, and then topped it with canned whipped cream.  Still delicious, and a great idea!  Thanks for sharing."
895132,503721,2014/6/26,5,"I don&#039;t know how I could miss this during ZWT last year, but I did. Now that I&#039;ve become aware of it, I tried it and am absolutely excited about it, it&#039;s so gooood!! I used full fat coconut cream instead of the cream, and it was divine. Thanks for sharing, BK!"
37449,515607,2014/6/2,5,"This was a few more steps than just roasting, but worth it!  I used some broccoli too and it turned out nice. I enjoyed the lemon, it gave an extra touch. Thanks!"
226863,515607,2014/9/21,5,"Made this for a snack to eat while watching football, and we really enjoyed it.  Our lemon was very large so I only used 1/4 of it.  The lemon flavor still came through.  Really loved the dusting of kosher salt at the end....especially since I ate it as a snack!  Like saffron popcorn!!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Football Pool Summer 2014 at yuku."
169430,512722,2014/4/8,5,"Oh My Gosh, what a great treat!. I did make one change, as I&#039;m not much of a wine fan I replaced it with a dose of half and half. It came out delicious and quite special. Perfect for guests or holidays as well as being something lovely for the family. It&#039;s not difficult to to make (I used pickerel) and rolls up quite nicely. Just to be safe I used a toothpick to secure the roll up. The blue cheese adds a very nice little flavor punch. Thanks so much breezer for sharing this tasty find."
381180,512722,2014/12/14,5,"Nice flavor combinations!  The hardest part was rolling the fillets.  I dropped the shrimp into boiling water and removed them after about 30 seconds, running cold water over the shrimp to stop the cooking process.  Then I made the recipe as written, but used only 1/3 cup butter, topping the fillets with extra shrimp for the last 8 minutes in the oven.  Tagged for the For Your Consideration game at http://4foodfriendsandfun.yuku.com/ ~"
542159,518261,2014/9/5,3,"This turned out ok after I did a little guessing, the title and step one both call for honey but none is listed in the ingredients so I took a guess and used 1/2 cup. Also step one says add rice vinegar which was also not in the ingredients so used a 1/4 cup. All in all it turned out nicely with DH enjoying it and me thinking it needed just a bit of something more. I am putting the missing ingredients off to some of the problems this site has had of late. Thanks for the post."
128473,518261,2014/9/10,3,"I&#039;m giving this a three because my dh didn&#039;t enjoy the sauce. I did, I liked the different flavors.  I think my dh was expecting something more.  This recipe was quick and easy to make with nice results.  The chicken was a little dry but the sauce covers it nicely.  Made as written, but didn&#039;t add the cornstarch to the sauce, just dipped the chicken in it served it over rice, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  I made this for Culinary Quest -2014 for the Suitcase Gourmets."
2651564,518069,2014/8/21,5,Amazing recipe!!! Tons of flavor... Yummy!

1266167,518069,2014/8/27,5,What a great combo! My kids would love this one!
2001452307,518069,2017/4/1,5,Very awesome and different than my normal meals. Cooking was super quick as I had used leftover meatballs from our sandwiches the other night . I also added slices of boudan sausage since that's what I had and turned out awesome. I also served garlic bread with it. Was very filling and I had tons of leftovers because I almost doubled the totellinis all and all a very good dish !!
2001408863,527002,2017/2/27,4,Was delicious and will make it again. Thank You.
114243,523359,2015/9/5,0,"This recipe is almost exactly like firemandave&#039;s version, even down to some of the same wording in the instructions. What a strange coincidence. LOL 
http://www.food.com/recipe/wienerschnitzel-chili-as-close-as-you-will-find-466215
I&#039;ll have to give your adaptation a try and see how it compares to his. I really like his recipe and so does my family. We don&#039;t have wienerschnitzel where I live, but we&#039;ve visited them in other states and their chili-dogs are amazing! :) I can&#039;t give any stars yet because I haven&#039;t tried your adaptation, but when I do I&#039;ll come back and rate it. :)"
2001690833,523156,2017/8/28,5,Made this for the family today as a test and full marks no cake left.
2001561560,528956,2017/6/27,0,Nom nom!
2532085,521101,2015/9/14,0,I made this yesterday and I have to say its awesome.  I used mixed vegetables since that is what i had on hand.  I also added water to the soy sauce to make it 1/2 a cup since I find soy sauce to be very powerful.  thanks for the easy recipe.
2000371278,500823,2017/9/28,5,I made this soup before I knew there was a recipe for it! My version is a little different and turned out great! I want to try this recipe next time just to compare the two.
2001487164,500823,2017/12/11,5,Wow !! Super good !!
128473,506304,2016/7/4,5,"This was an awesome recipe Breezer. I loved it, I enjoyed it for lunch a few times, served it with carrot sticks, cucumber slices and nana bread. It was so good. I also served it with apple, pear and banana slices on top of flat bread. Just the perfect amount of spice. Kudos to you on a recipe that I will make often. This is going into my favorites cookbook for 2016. Thank you so much for sharing. Made for First Time Tag"
2689184,494956,2013/2/11,5,This was really easy to make!  I made extra chipotle yogurt sauce because it was so tasty.
2694684,494956,2013/2/15,5,"I love tacos and this is something new , because the chipotle yogurt adds to the flavor. Super!"
1800073522,507170,2013/9/24,5,"They&#039;re delicious!  I love regular snickerdoodles, but I couldn&#039;t stop eating these!"
1802993906,507170,2014/8/4,5,Best thing in the world! They truly make my world go round!
37449,511066,2014/1/3,5,"I had planned to make a large batch of this, but got sick, so just made a little for me. I got really lazy and just layered tortilla, then filling, etc. Used some canned enchilada sauce. Very much enjoyed. Thanks!"
452355,511066,2014/2/25,5,"We enjoyed these enchiladas last night for dinner.  They had a great smokey flavor from the chipotles in adobo.  We made the home-made sauce versus using store bought.  I think this recipe is better suited for a weekend night as it is a bit labor intensive for a weekday meal.  I substituted grated dark chocolate for the cocoa powder because that is what I had on hand, and substituted queso fresco for the cotija, again because that is what I had.  Again, this was a very nice meal.  Thanks!"
1706426,507106,2013/9/23,5,"What a wonderful way to use up all these summer crops. We really enjoyed the sandwiches, although I did go a little lighter on the herbs. Made for PRMR."
2001631445,498010,2017/7/17,4,Used to make this all the time its my favorite Atkins recipe until I lost my book. I like to thicken this with arrowroot or cornstarch and use like a gravy over rice. Noticed that when to put the Thyme in was missing from the directions. I added it in with the shallots to cook.
266635,511066,2014/5/20,5,"Great enchiladas -- the sauce was really delish and I won&#039;t be buying canned enchilada sauce anymore.  Served this dish alongside some mango/avocado guacamole.  Made as directed; although next time I will reduce the baking time in half as everything is cooked and the baking time seemed a little too long.  Made for PRMR, May, 2014."
126440,509976,2013/12/9,5,"Exactly how I make my gravy, love it."
739506,512960,2017/6/4,2,OMG way too much cinnamon ! Maybe a typo? reduce to 1 teaspoon. I Used almond milk and avocado oil to reduce calories. That said a little to floury for me. Like the fluffiness. Also added a pinch of salt.
2000758234,515899,2015/12/20,5,Fantastic recipe!
133174,493785,2013/2/20,5,These are so simple and amazingly good.  I used to chicken breasts that were cut lengthwise and then cut into strips.  I only let the chicken marinade for about 45 minutes.  The meat was well flavored and very moist.  They were served on to of yellow rice for a delicious meal.  Made for Aussie Swap.
329769,493785,2013/3/31,5,Reviewed for Aus/NZ Forum Recipe Swap March 2013 (where a team member has dropped out). These were really good and enjoyed by my family for an Easter barbie lunch. Sorry that I didn&#039;t get a photo. Marinated the chicken and assembled just before cooking. The lemon juice made the chicken super tender.
1803053136,518070,2014/8/26,0,Haven&#039;t tried it yet sounds good but the never seen chicken look like cake.
2001273318,530632,2017/4/14,0,rip
1803170540,504699,2014/9/25,4,"Absolutely delicious! I did end up adding more valveeta (about a cup) because I had a little extra. I also used homemade chicken broth, about 4 cups. I think I&#039;ll cut the broccoli smaller. Great base recipe tho."
47892,505394,2013/8/28,5,"Took this delicious bread to a function but forgot to take a picture beforehand! Next time! I used a variety of olives, fresh rosemary from the garden and did add the optional lemon zest. Good alone or with a cheese and veg platter (vegs from our CSA box!), homemade romesco and une bouteille de vin blanc. Thanks for posting! Made for Veg Tag/August."
2001096235,500096,2016/7/20,1,"This recipe is the worst! We tried it several times, and they just don't cook. The outside gets hard but the inside is actual liquid. The texture of our best-cooked effort was similar to chewed gum. Please take this recipe off this website, or at least put it at the bottom of this list of other delicious recipes. Thank you!"
1802595729,511524,2014/3/18,5,"Absolutely delicious! I did not have any buttermilk, so I substituted with milk and white vinegar.  I am sure that the cake tastes better with buttermilk, but my family still loved it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also froze some of the cake and had it a couple months later.  It was just as scrumptious!"
1802879096,511524,2014/7/2,0,I made this and used 1/2 the blueberries and doubled the vanilla- it was a success.&lt;br/&gt;It&#039;s my new holiday staple!!
1803786474,511524,2015/6/6,5,Not too sweet so you really enjoy the blueberry taste.   Easy recipe to follow. I find that it&#039;s always better to make the day before serving. What can I say it just tastes better after the flavors meld.
2002070301,535389,2018/3/23,5,Wonderfully delecious and satisfying. The right marriage of salt and sweet with a Subtle kick of ginger! Served it with white rice and it turned out to be nothing but extremely tasty.
2851315,501387,2013/6/4,5,"Great spread, I always have some in the fridge!"
2423055,497166,2013/3/11,5,These sound easy to make and delicious. Perfect for a weeknight meal! nj
2201427,497166,2013/3/22,5,What a great idea!!!  I love this recipe ..... using tuna in the potato pancake is such a great idea....   Delicious!!
2216338,497166,2013/3/24,5,Simple and DELICIOUS!  sw :)
2680727,497166,2013/3/24,5,Easy breezy main course.

1196075,497166,2013/3/25,0,"These sound quick and easy to make, but really yummy too!  Winner!!!"
227978,496223,2013/3/22,5,"I am the oatmeal fan in the family, so I was glad to run across this recipe because it is for 1 serving, and it was a surprise bonus that it was a quick microwave recipe.  The peanut butter adds such a nice touch to the oatmeal and it meshes well the vanilla, brown sugar and cinnamon.  The next time my kids ask for oatmeal, I will certainly be happy to return to this recipe because I know they will love it, too.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Annacia.  Madefor Spring 2013 Pick-A-Chef."
542159,496223,2013/4/16,5,"Was a truly wonderful way to start the day! Loved the flavor the vanilla and brown sugar brought. Have happily enjoyed twice now but have not been able to get a photo either time Errr. But please believe when I say it has a wonderful cookie look to it when made in a wide red soup bowl and then microwaved for 1 minute after adding the brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla.  Thanks for the post."
222564,496223,2013/7/3,5,Just like biting into an oatmeal cookie! I used 2 tbs brown sugar and cooked this on the stove top in a traditional manner because I don&#039;t fancy microwave ovens. Never new oatmeal could be so yummy!
2198132,497166,2013/3/25,5,"Yum, what a great new recipe for tuna and so quick to make!"
2192609,497166,2013/3/25,5,Another Great Recipe from a very talented cook!
2657133,497166,2013/3/25,5,Yummmmm.... these are easy and delicious!!!
318262,494518,2013/3/1,4,"I did like this concept a lot and it was a fabulous inspiration. However, the sauce was a bit bland - it was perfect when I put out different condiments on the table (siracha, hoison, soy sauce) and people could kinda customize."
494867,494518,2013/6/30,5,This was fantastic!  It was super easy to do and I loved the flavors.  I added some mushrooms that needed to be used but otherwise followed the instructions exactly.  I would make this for company as a great Asian dinner!
323186,494727,2013/10/21,5,"Wow,  this really is something pretty special!!!!   Although I made it just for DH and I (and so he gets to enjoy it for a day or two :)  and we are having wonderful rainy weather, perfect soup weather :)  ),    it was so worth the effort --- I made this on a wet Saturday afternoon, took my time and stirred diligently, I felt very at ease with myself and the world and could hardly believe it when  I realised that I was ready to serve, the time had just flown by but so peacefully.  I&#039;m generally not a fan of soup but this hardly qualifies as soup, liquid decadence, and VERY filling, dont expect to go back for more!!!  Dantana, a winner, I&#039;m very glad I tried it, thank you for sharing!!!  Made and enjoyed for PRMR tag game"
352538,494727,2013/11/27,5,"Really wonderful soup.  This might be the thickest soup I&#039;ve ever made - add another potato or two and you would have some amazing mashed potatoes.  I used Granville Island Lion&#039;s Gate Winter Ale and it leaves a nice taste of ale at the back of the mouth.  I think it&#039;s important to make sure you like the beer you use because the soup does retain the beer flavour.  Before I added the sour cream and cheese, I thought the taste of the ale might have been too much but I was wrong.  It is beautifully balanced.  I agree with Karen Elizabeth&#039;s review - &quot;this hardly qualifies as soup, liquid decadence&quot;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for posting this one.  It is a definite keeper."
2000023336,494727,2015/2/25,5,Great soup. I was scared after I poured the beer into the chicken stock- roux it was too bitter but the potatoes salt and cheese balanced it out..I used a lager beer...put cubed (uncooked/peeled) russet potatoes in and let them cook in the liquid and it was fine no need for pre-baking...then come to find out.. I didn&#039;t have sour cream so I just added some whipped cream cheese...my husband devoured it...really really good soup!!!
2000388888,494727,2016/11/30,2,To much beer. It was all we could taste.
542159,495174,2013/2/17,5,"A truly easy week night dinner with all the sides include, really enjoyed mashing the potatoes into the sauce made from the pesto, chicken broth and Hidden Valley. I made using whole leg quarters as that is all I had on hand and so want to try this recipe also used whole cut up carrots again did not have baby carrots. In the description it says to free and adjust the veggies so next time I may add some green beans to the existing combo of carrots and potatoes. Thanks for the great post and good luck in the contest."
653438,512668,2014/5/6,5,"All I can say is that this is DELICIOUS.  DH and I love garlic but I did use little cloves (all I had) but it still had the garlicy flavor.  Definately a keeper.  Made the homemade pico de gallo and we had this served with recipe#300679#300679, recipe#344392#344392, Spanish rice and the home made salsa.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
461834,495174,2013/2/22,5,"Wow!!!  My house smelled wonderful while this was cooking, couldn't wait to eat it for my lunch.  I scaled back the recipe and used boneless, skinless chicken breast.  I used recipe#234198, #234198 for the pesto sauce, which also worked well for my Weight Watcher diet.  Since I was at home, I made mine in the oven.  I covered it and cooked for about 1 hour at 275 degrees and then uncovered it for about 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and good luck with the contest!!"
226863,495174,2013/2/22,5,"What a great recipe to have waiting for you when you come home from work!  I really enjoy all the ingredients, so knew I'd like this.  I used bone in, skinless breasts and I browned them before putting them in the crockpot on top of the vegetables.  I added some green beans so that I'd have a complete meal in one.  Thanks for sharing!  Good luck in the contest!"
2191031,495174,2013/2/23,5,"My sister suggested I make this.  I am a ""challenged"" cook, and usually mess everything up.  But this recipe was easy enough that it was even foolproof for me! :) Tasted great too....my husband had seconds."
2427111,495174,2013/2/23,5,So easy a new husband can do it! Smelled great and tasted yummy.
2426925,495174,2013/2/24,5,Sometimes the simplest recipes are best.
895132,495174,2013/2/25,5,"So easy and yummy!! I used my own home made pesto and because there is no original Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing available in Germany, I used a copycat which I found somewhere on the net and which I've used before in recipes. I'm glad I made this, it was pure comfort food on a chilly day. Thanks for sharing this, and good luck with the contest!"
204024,495174,2013/3/2,5,This dish was loved by my whole family.  The leftovers the next day were delicious.  The house smelled wonderful while this cooked. Good luck in the contest.
486725,495174,2015/1/28,5,"I love that this is a complete meal done ahead of time, and the pesto gives it a great flavor. I used a half cup of broth (for a half recipe), but I think I would add more next time, so the chicken can soak up the juiciness from it - and I think to make it more &quot;stew-like&quot; wouldn&#039;t be a bad thing either. Any which way, a very good all-in-one dish!"
1122988,495174,2015/2/10,4,"This was pretty good and quite easy.  I made mine with leftover spinach pesto that needed to be used up.  The chicken was a little dried out, but otherwise, it was good.  I&#039;ll just cook it less time next time."
829250,495174,2015/4/1,3,I thought this was good! My husband said it was ok. My daught er and niece turned their nose up and refused.
169430,502850,2013/8/24,5,"I saw this not long after the start of ZWT 9 round 3 and was determined to make it before the round. I made it! It&#039;s still almost 80f, the salad dinner was perfect and delicious. Wonderful textures and flavors. :D"
480195,502850,2013/8/25,5,I made this using peas instead of green beans. It was a very nice blend of ingredients and the flavor was excellent. A perfect salad that can sit and be served at room temperature. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
945395,507592,2013/11/28,5,"This is like no other sweet potato dish I&#039;ve ever tried. The combined flavors are surprising, amazing and each ingredient complements the next beautifully. I love your technique of soaking the sweet potatoes... Brilliant. Thanks for another great recipe, ChefPisces... from Pisces Moon Chef Aries with a Cancer ascendant... hehe"
526411,513343,2018/10/5,5,This is great! I've made it several times but lost the recipe. I do remember that the original recipe called for blueberry topping instead of pie filling. The pie filling works much better. I came here in search of this recipe.
239758,503422,2016/7/30,5,"We loved this fantastic salad and its wonderful mixture of flavours. I made as written except that I didn't have any carrots on hand, so used red bell pepper (capsicum) instead. Hey, red is close to orange. Thanks so much for posting."
895132,503422,2016/8/7,5,Wonderfully flavourful salad! We both loved it. Thanks for sharing! Made for Culinary Quest 2016 / Indonesia for team IH?
1925885,504814,2013/8/16,5,"Jackie, you&#039;ve done it again!  This is a fantastic recipe!  This was a real treat for us because we hardly ever have steak, and we were a bit worried that the chermoula would overpower it.  But we needn&#039;t have worried! The chermoula is spicy and piquant - just the perfect complement. Instead of brochettes, we grilled the steak whole and sliced it on the bias. We served the peppers and onions separately, but also grilled.  Sort of a deconstructed brochette, if you will.  Thank you for posting, we will definitely be making this again!  Made for team Gourmet Goddesses, ZWT9."
865936,504814,2013/8/17,5,I made this with flanken cut ribs and it was absolutely delicious. I served it with a rice salad
2001838539,534264,2017/12/4,0,Has anyone every tried real chocolate and not the candy melts?
2324285,513216,2014/3/1,5,"I&#039;ve tried several different microwave mug cake recipes ever since I discovered they were a thing a few months ago, but was always disappointed with the results.  They always tasted like sweet chocolate-flavored omelettes. This eggless recipe, on the other hand, is perfect.  The texture is as close to an oven-baked cake as anyone can hope for.  3 tablespoons of cocoa powder sound like a lot, but the rich taste was actually perfect- almost like a dark chocolate cake.  I almost hate that you posted this, because I know I will be making it way more often that I should.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
2000077466,513216,2015/3/21,4,Made this today.  Only problem was that after I added the liquid to the dry ingredients there wasn&#039;t enough liquid and it just went into a lump.  So added a little more vegetable oil and water till it was a thick liquid consistency.  And then I cooked it for a little bit longer as well.  Turned out really good.  Will make it again.
2000104925,513216,2015/3/31,5,"I love this recipe for a couple reasons. It gives that chocolate taste and richness that totally satisfies, and it&#039;s vegan! I look for   eggless microwave recipes constantly and this is then only one that has that vegan aspect and doesn&#039;t taste like cardboard! However, the first time I made it the flour clumped at the bottom, so the next I made it I simply added the vegetable oil at the bottom, and that helped with the clumps at the bottom and made it easier to stir. Great recipe!!"
2000207283,513216,2015/5/16,3,What I like about the recipe is it is simple and quick. But what disappointed me was the sugar was on the very less side and the water/milk I had to add twice the quantity! Probably some mreoil could have been added.
2000229196,513216,2015/5/26,4,"I didn&#039;t have baking powder so I made it without. It was really dense and dark, but that&#039;s my fault. I just stirred it up a lot, added tons of powdered sugar, and after a few minutes, a splash of milk to make it like weird pudding."
2000234729,513216,2015/5/29,0,"As far as some of these reviews go, they say that this mug cake is amazing, I would like to disagree with that, when I got mine out from the microwave, It looked amazing, but when I tasted it, it was like cardboard, it didn&#039;t taste very good and it wasn&#039;t moist at all it was very dry and I was very  sad because I was really looking forward to this mug cake."
2000245208,513216,2015/6/3,0,Ok I have eaten so many mug cakes but when I had no eggs I decided to try this and to be honest it is so much nicer. It&#039;s really gooey and way nicer texture than the egg versions. Plus it tastes waaaaaay better. I paired it with salted caramel sauce and it was devine! But be careful- if you let it go cold it gets really stiff!
2000269267,513216,2015/6/14,0,"It&#039;s a good recipe, but if you don&#039;t want it to be too dry, I suggest not cooking it for 2 minutes. It also depends on the microwave, so you could cook it for 1 minute, check the texture and then, if needed, cook for 15 seconds, check it and so on."
2000302739,513216,2015/6/29,5,"I was desperate for cake, but feeling lazy. Turns out this is an excellent solution- definitely exceeded my expectations.  The cake is moist and actually tastes like a chocolate cake, not at all a spongy/rubbery almost-cake.  I used butter because my only other option would have been olive oil, and after reading some other reviews, I decided to microwave for 1.5 minutes and let it sit for about a minute before removing. Yum!"
2000337436,513216,2015/7/14,5,Great. Would be perfect with an addition of vanilla. Thx!
2000376264,513216,2015/8/1,5,"Used coconut oil instead, also added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp espresso powder.  Delicious!"
1635908,513216,2015/8/3,5,"This was the perfect recipe for an emergency bday cake(s) when the air conditioner went on the fritz on a hot summer day.  
I just 5x&#039;d the recipe to make enough for the whole family.  I mixed a large batch then divided into 5 individual mugs.  
They were perfect! Moist and very chocolatey.  Delicious served with ice cream, whipped cream, and a little chocolate sundae sauce for the perfect dessert!"
2000387276,513216,2015/8/6,4,"The best mug cake recipe ever! I&#039;ve tried some other recipes before, but none of them gives a super fantastic taste like this recipe! I personally find 3tbs of sugar makes the cake too sweet, and 3tbs of oil makes it too greasy, so I just reduce those ingredients to the way I want. Overall, this recipe is superb!!"
2000400771,513216,2015/8/13,5,"This recipe is so good!! I actually love baking but this is the first time that I&#039;ve tried making a chocolate mug cake! I used melted butter since I have no vegetable oil and I added 1 tsp coffee powder just to add more flavor. Then I powdered some confectioner&#039;s sugar on top. The only thing is that the bottom is as hard as the crust of a cheesecake. But over all, it tasted really great! As good as an oven-baked cake.  Will surely recommend this to my family and friends!"
2000430998,513216,2015/8/26,0,"I need some advice... i tried ur recipe the cake texture was fine but my cake was way to salty, even though i followed the recipe exactly. please help me!!"
2000481616,513216,2015/9/17,3,"turned out very dry and hard, but i fixed it by dipping it in milk :)"
2000497436,513216,2015/9/25,0,"much too sickly with a really weird undertaste. don&#039;t mean to offend anyone with this but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. if you make it, make sure you have gallons of milk available! ?"
2000647508,513216,2015/11/6,0,"Eating up right after making when it is still hot, it was very awesome! But I substituted half of the oil with greek yogurt, experimented with sugar/sweetner combination, and put a teaspoon amount of honey to have gooey - moist texture. It was still, delicious!"
2000675589,513216,2015/11/14,1,"Disappointing - could taste the oil (I used canola) in it even though I reduced it slightly. Probably wouldn&#039;t make again, but if I did I&#039;d definitely use butter instead!"
2000703399,513216,2015/11/23,5,Ok I made a lot of substitutions.  I ran out of cocoa only had 1 T so I used chocolate chips as well.  I try  to eaten gluten so I tried a rice flour and instead of refined sugar and brown sugar I used Turbinado raw sugar and some vanilla as suggested.  This still turned out very good.  The texture is not light and fluffy but tastes like a brownie it&#039;s very good just the right amount of sweetness as well.  I will try this for my new family I have been hired to cook for.  AWESOME!
2000732754,513216,2015/12/7,4,best mug cake ive had! no egg keeps it from getting a weird texture and taste from the microwave! i think it would be better with vanilla icecream or whipped cream but all i had was powdered sugar which tastes good too! definitely reccommend!
2000877809,513216,2016/2/16,5,Thanks for the recipe . Made me very happy as the recipe turned out to be pretty great . I improvised by adding cinnamon powder and raisins . Keep up the good job.
2000950221,513216,2016/3/31,5,"Very pleased with my very first mug cake experience! I subbed high-quality olive oil instead of vegetable oil, which I thought was super tasty! Recommended if you like olive oil cake. I followed every other direction exactly, and the result was a warm, gooey, slighty sweet dark chocolate cake. I mixed in some frozen raspberries afterwards, which blended with all the other flavors wonderfully. Best late-night, desperate-for-cake recipe!"
2000985461,513216,2016/4/24,4,"After adding the wet to the dry, in no way did my mixture become &quot;runny&quot;. I decided to add 1 tbsp of hot coffee to it to achieve that consistency. 

Overall, it&#039;s a pretty good mug chocolate cake that satisfies a maddening craving. It&#039;s quite gooey, rich and dark with all the cocoa. I minused a tbsp of sugar because I prefer it not too sweet. It was perfect. But, if you like it just sweet enough, the 3 tbsp as stated would do the trick."
2001064983,513216,2016/6/27,5,"I usually never review or rate a recipe, but this one: the best mug cake recipe I've ever come across. It has not even been a day and I've already made it twice. I've tried several mug cake recipes, those with bananas, cooking chocolate, Nutella and the sort but all of them were either too dry or gooey or too bitter. This recipe has the best texture you can get from a microwave cake. Also, I added a pinch of coffee in a teaspoon of hot water, it really deepened the chocolate flavour. Also, I found the batter a little less sweet, so I squeezed a little chocolate syrup in the batter. Great recipe. A very forgiving recipe, doesn't go bad if you tinker with it. Must try."
2001085397,513216,2016/7/12,5,"It's delicious, especially when I use vanilla almond milk."
2001461828,513216,2017/3/29,5,"It was super delicious! Better than those cakes with eggs. Honestly, it tastes much better like that. I used 1 full table spoon of cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon of chocolate powder, no sugar, no salt, 6 tablespoons of milk,3 tablespoons of olive oil and finally, tablespoons all-purpose flour. I would highly recommend it."
2001479386,513216,2017/4/9,5,"I made this without the baking powder because I couldn't find any. The only thing the baking powder does is make the cake fluffier, and it tastes perfectly fine without it. I drizzled caramel sauce on top of mine and it was superb."
2001510370,513216,2017/4/27,4,It's good cKe but my family claims too bitter because of it having too much cocoa powder
2001551802,513216,2017/5/24,4,"Cake was fluffy and tasted good. I was skeptical about this no bake cake, but the texture was very good, maybe even better than oven baked eggless cakes. That being said, it did taste a bit bitter, maybe because I used raw cane sugar over white sugar. But I&quot;d more sugar next time. Also, this is no 1 person cake, it is really big. I made just 1 but my husband and I couldn't finish it ! Also I had to add an extra tbsp of milk/water, as strictly following the recipe didn't actually give me a running liquid. Overall it's the best tasting/texture mug cake I've made, so it's a keeper !"
2001588586,513216,2017/6/17,5,Wow! This is FANTASTIC. I used 3 Tablespoons of melted unsalted butter instead of oil. I opted for the 1T brown sugar and 2T granulated sugar. I used 3 T almond milk instead of dairy. I cooked it for 1 1/2 minutes. THANK YOU! Best mug cake ever!
2001833226,513216,2017/12/1,0,"Sooooooo good!! I used 3 tbsps Self-Rising flour, and 3 tbsps brown sugar instead... AMAZING!!! Way gooier and way more brownie like. Loved it!!"
2002046304,513216,2018/3/12,5,So good and tasty and not at all dry! Just made it and it turned out the yummiest I have ever tried!
2002153285,513216,2018/5/15,5,"Switched out the cocoa for PB Fit powder and simply stuck to three tablespoons of brown sugar, it came out pretty nice - gooey with a great peanut butter flavor!"
2002283366,513216,2018/9/24,0,Can I switch out vegetable oil for something else
2000292160,534264,2017/12/6,0,how did you make the trees????? Can't rate it until I make it. But your directions do not show how to make the trees - which is what you pictured.
2695462,493193,2013/2/15,0,"I printed this out and was so focused on the ingredients, I didn't realize there are no instructions on how to cook the chicken.  Also, Muenster Cheese is not listed in the ingredients, only in the instructions.  I'm cooking the chicken in a skillet before I assemble all of the ingredients for the sauce. I don't know what the end results will be."
2718447,493193,2013/3/7,5,"Excellent dish!  A little time consuming, but the results were amazing!"
323186,493193,2014/4/15,5,"Absolutely delicious!  Made exactly as according to recipe, I would definitely make this again,  the only part that really takes a bit of time is marinating the chicken strips, just needs thinking ahead.  I assembled everything I needed prior to cooking.   I really enjoyed this recipe, made for Spring PAC 2014, thank you Bibliobethica"
254614,497671,2013/3/17,5,"I am so happy you posted this recipe! We ate this dish many times in Taiwan. It is sooo good!&lt;br/&gt;I didn&#039;t write the recipe, thought I could remember all ingredients. It was never the same, because I couldn&#039;t remember all and measurements. Make sure you serve with hard boiled eggs. If you refrigerate leftovers, it will be spicier. Again, thank you."

1580637,511554,2017/10/30,4,These were pretty good but too gingery. Also a bit too firm. Otherwise pretty good. I think I'll try them again with a few tweaks.

560491,504096,2013/8/26,5,This is great rice that you can serve with any kind of meat.  Only change I made was to use chicken stock instead of veggie.  Will be making this again; it is a nice change from plain brown rice and the flavors are not overwhelming.
37449,504096,2014/5/19,5,"I used brown and white rice, and added some lentils into the mix. Loved the spice and the lemon kicked it up a notch! I don&#039;t have a rice steamer so cooked in pan on the stove. Thanks!"
80353,503006,2013/7/14,5,Simple and delicious.  I love the sweet of the beet with the tart of the vinegar and the hum of the garlic.

239758,503006,2016/8/20,5,"Oh yum, oh yum, oh yum! I bought 3 pounds of beets yesterday for $2, and I know how the other 2 pounds will get used. This recipe is excellent and oh-so easy to make. I had to laugh at your suggestion that peel the beets could be 'messy'. You should see my colourful hands. :) We're big fans of feta cheese so I added about 2 ounces of crumbled feta. This will become a go-to recipe. So many thanks for posting."

381180,507051,2013/9/28,5,"Very easy ~ with a light cinnamon flavor. My filberts were already dry roasted so I skipped step #1, then made as written, but reduced oven temperature to 300F after the first 10 minutes because I felt they were browning too quickly . Baked a total of 35 minutes. For Fall Rookie Recipe Tag, tagged 9/19 Due 10/3."
169430,507051,2014/9/6,5,I adore &quot;munching&quot; nuts and always have bag&#039;s of them around the house. This is a yummy use for hazelnuts. Very easy and delicious. Mine were raw so I took the tip from the previous reviewer and baked them at 300 for about 45-50 mins. Another recipe that would be perfect for winter holidays as well as general snacking. Made for Culinary Quest 2014.
169430,501163,2013/6/21,5,One of the best cakes I can remember making. The only word I can think of to best describe the texture is delicate. It made a beautifully soft and fine textured that was moist and delicious. In fact the cake was so light that I was concerned that the ice cream might be too heavy as a topping and that the soft ice cream (homemade vanilla) might quickly soak into it making the cake soggy. What I did was to serve the cake with the ice cream and peach topping in a dish on the side to be eaten with the cake. I will certainly make this perfectly spiced cake again but I&#039;ll just drizzle a bit of caramel sauce on it.
220348,501163,2013/6/21,5,"This is a moist and fragrant cake, and very much enjoyed. The ice was a nice touch, as a topping, but it never took anything away from the cake. The spices were never too much, and it was a nice combination, too."
865936,503409,2013/7/16,5,"This was really great!  I did not miss my ole buddy, ole pal mayo one bit!  I did not measure the dressing ingredients exactly, so I may have doubled them, mmmmm..."
542159,502777,2018/8/20,4,Such an easy and healthy dish. The cayenne pepper add just the right amount of kick without taking away from any of the other flavors. I served as a vegetarian meal a side of Corn Scones. Thanks for the post.
199848,516687,2014/8/5,5,This is very good and a great way to use leftover corned beef.  I buy and make corned beef any time of the year; not just in March.  This is perfect for a lunch or dinner the next day.  It&#039;s hearty and filling.  I may add in some carrots next time for some added sweetness and color. Thanx for sharing!
67728,503409,2013/7/24,4,"The Andouille sausage was a really great addition here! I got distracted and overcooked my potatoes a little bit, so my salad wasn&#039;t as pretty as it should&#039;ve been, but that was totally my fault. I don&#039;t like green bell pepper, so I subbed in a red one instead (for some reason, I don&#039;t mind the taste of any other color of bell pepper, just the green ones). The vinegar was a little bit strong, but it might have just been the particular one I used. I would make this again -- the spice and meat in it make it a definite guy pleaser. Thanks for posting! Made for The Holy Trinity challenge for ZWT9"

2706765,496020,2013/2/23,0,good
58104,494731,2013/4/3,5,This is so easy. Tha banana makes it super sweet so no sweeteners are needed. A healthy way to start the day. My version was made with raw organic milk making it not vegan. Love all the fiber this has.
7968394,494731,2014/12/29,0,"...this was a super easy recipe, and a delicious way to start any day."
2002135845,528102,2018/4/30,0,How'd it turn out? Can I use sherbet ice cream instead?
1803501916,499306,2014/12/14,5,"This is very rich- there are two sticks of butter and a cup of brown sugar in the praline topping!!, but not as sweet as you might think. You could add maple syrup without drowning in sugar, but we prefer it without any further enhancement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since it is heavy in butter fats, I only make this a couple times a year, for holidays, but it&#039;s definitely a tradition the teens look forward to every year."
2000181163,499306,2015/5/3,0,"super easy to make ahead and put in the fridge. i use this recipe every year when i have a large group of overnight guests. i get to wake up and just throw it in the oven. fry some bacon and/or sausage to go with it, and everyone enjoys it. it is requested now as a favourite!"
2001492556,499306,2017/4/16,5,This has become a family favorite for every holiday. It's easy to make and tastes great. I strongly suggest making this one.
2001637187,499306,2017/7/29,5,My whole family loved it! I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted with maple syrup &amp; it still came out delicious! I topped it with whipped cream &amp; fresh fruit. I will be making this for Christmas this year. THANK YOU!
2958555,515109,2014/9/23,1,"I followed directions exactly. Way too much potato, not enough crab or flavor. Made enough filling for twice as many phyllo cups, which I didn&#039;t have, so it didn&#039;t heat properly. Not worth the trouble. Sorry, but not delicious and the only place they disappeared to was the trash."
488441,508236,2014/1/21,5,This makes a yummy chicken salad! I used store bought prepared chicken and chopped it up. The only change I made was to add avocado in place of the mayo on the bread and added alfalfa sprouts for the crunch. Just lovely! Made for Football Pool 2013.
2001552506,507383,2018/11/28,5,Very good! unfortunately my grocery store didn't have kabocha so I substituted acorn and coated the inside with a bit of honey to make up for lost sweetness. Would recommend two acorn squashes if you do this since they're smaller.
